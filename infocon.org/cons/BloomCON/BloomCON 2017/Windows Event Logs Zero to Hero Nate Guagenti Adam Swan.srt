snippets of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Power Cell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff so if</font>

11
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:42,250
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay close I school if not I</font>

13
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,750
good all right well I'm gonna I'm glad

14
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,960
everybody could make it after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that crazy</font>

15
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:52,630
after party yesterday dual-core<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:56,679
play some<font color="#E5E5E5"> good music but I'm naked with</font>

17
00:01:52,630 --> 00:02:02,050
Jenny<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok Neutron and this and this is</font>

18
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:05,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">Adam yeah we give a bio if we had an</font>

19
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:09,880
interesting life but sorry so yeah our

20
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:12,549
talk is about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> event logs so</font>

21
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,299
background of why we did this was

22
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:18,190
basically Adam have been taking some

23
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,860
forensics classes I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> finished up</font>

24
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:24,400
doing some like red team after incident

25
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:28,239
and you know basically these red<font color="#E5E5E5"> teams</font>

26
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,280
usually have so much so much noise<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

27
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,720
basically like a forest falling instead

28
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,260
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tree falling in the forest it's</font>

29
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,090
usually pretty pretty loud so a couple

30
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,299
of reasons it's free<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple to implement</font>

31
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:43,180
with group policy I mean you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go zero</font>

32
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,370
to hero you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> your endpoints will be</font>

33
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,620
compromised you know network forensics

34
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,440
becomes pretty difficult especially with

35
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:55,060
you know a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the legitimate domains</font>

36
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:59,980
or domain fronting and you know apt or

37
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:02,350
usually does magic sometimes so more

38
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,810
than likely you will catch them this is

39
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:07,030
what the vendors will tell you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

40
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">is not a this mon like replacement it's</font>

41
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,190
a supplement like if you if you can

42
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement this mon Dieu it but where we</font>

43
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,850
summer places we work get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have an</font>

44
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,579
approved product

45
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,960
and it's usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> worse than the process</font>

46
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">is worse than applying for a home loan</font>

47
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:25,020
if anybody has ever done that but maybe

48
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,210
nonsenses at the college so first thing

49
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,360
if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything done in security</font>

50
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:32,460
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be you need to become that's</font>

51
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,590
not necessarily friends but need to get

52
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:37,260
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know your system admins your help</font>

53
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,180
even help<font color="#E5E5E5"> desk those folks because you</font>

54
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,500
know they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be they're going</font>

56
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,100
stuff for you they're going to be one

57
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,359
specific windows event logs are only

58
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,239
going you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> only going to want on</font>

59
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,070
certain devices one of my fries are

60
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,040
going to be the first line of<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense</font>

61
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,290
had somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> that worked at a bank told</font>

62
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,390
me that the tier 3 or the higher up

63
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,790
people had like on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> white board</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

64
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:01,859
number of days since tier<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 had talked</font>

65
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:05,519
to them and I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just only think like</font>

66
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:08,100
what is tier<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 not telling them right so</font>

67
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,960
they're also going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to quickly help you d</font>

68
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,960
complete the activity I'd one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

69
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,870
easiest things for us is to call up the

70
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,549
system admin you know and be like hey

71
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,680
was this you and I will literally save

72
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:22,200
us like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know 10 hours of</font>

73
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">investigation right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I get I was me</font>

74
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:29,340
running that random process or doing

75
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:31,110
something I shouldn't have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> so how</font>

76
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,460
do you get so you tell these system

77
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,890
admins you tell you windows that means

78
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,659
these folks like you know I want this

79
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and first thing you know</font>

80
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,360
they're always going to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> having been</font>

81
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,740
a systems admin<font color="#CCCCCC"> personal windows admin</font>

82
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,110
person is like well what's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for me</font>

83
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,480
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know is it going to break something</font>

84
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,670
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always the first thing right so</font>

85
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,980
you have you have you have many use

86
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:52,110
cases from host-based auditing this is

87
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,520
big in government environments like you

88
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,950
know you could probably get rid of some

89
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">of your a cat a cast and nessa scanning</font>

90
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:00,780
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows event</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> logs like it's going</font>

91
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:03,630
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you when somebody will try not</font>

92
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too much to talk but if the</font>

93
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:08,070
host based auditing you can do is

94
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,570
fantastic you know maybe somebody two

95
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,390
leaders<font color="#CCCCCC"> a network share that's why they</font>

96
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,070
can't access it you know hey hey guys

97
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,630
like I'm able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell some of the admins</font>

98
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:18,000
like hey this computer is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to die</font>

99
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:21,719
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's throwing errors left and right</font>

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,310
and then yeah one more funny ones is

101
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,840
well

102
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,850
like when people are constantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> turning</font>

103
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,260
off computers so but yeah come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font>

104
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,490
some of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own ideas like we haven't</font>

105
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,980
scratched the surface and I'll probably

106
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:33,080
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that another three times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

107
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,700
disclaimer stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking on behalf of my</font>

108
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,109
company but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a disclaimer in case</font>

109
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:40,099
you push this and you break everything

110
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:42,230
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> test it you know to until</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't</font>

111
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,090
test it anymore usually create a VM

112
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:47,120
that's connected to your domain push the

113
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">gpo specific to that computer after</font>

114
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,660
you've already gone through like your

115
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,580
own little lab first right and become a

116
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,160
user test all different things right

117
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,409
like you and then repeat and repeat

118
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,600
again until<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't anymore and then</font>

119
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:05,690
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep having to anyways</font>

120
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:07,400
so so windows<font color="#CCCCCC"> event forwarding I guess</font>

121
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,890
they can be pushed through its built-in

122
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,560
could be pushed to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gpo sent from all</font>

123
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:15,650
your host your servers any<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows</font>

124
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:20,030
device push it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your sim we used</font>

125
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:23,330
elasticsearch because with NX logs

126
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:26,599
because basically it's in the talk later

127
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:29,300
but like we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two thousand fields</font>

128
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,070
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows event logs and elastic</font>

129
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,580
search has the ability to dynamically

130
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:37,340
create fields so with one of the places

131
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:40,340
we have to use our site like it took me

132
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:43,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">I to spend two days writing parser for</font>

133
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:47,000
power show just to jam it into our site

134
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,530
specific fields and and even in the

135
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,780
security fields which they do have a

136
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,059
parser for it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even grab half the</font>

137
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,260
field so there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably a hundred</font>

138
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,960
different channels you could subscribe

139
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:59,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">to so you can imagine and there's many</font>

140
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,710
events in those channels so multiplying

141
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,909
those things having an<font color="#E5E5E5"> employee in</font>

142
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,979
something like our side I'd be spending

143
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:08,480
the next year trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write those</font>

144
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:10,870
parsers so we'll let<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adam talk now that</font>

145
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,870
Mike work

146
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:24,040
testing yeah there we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

147
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:25,690
Nina has the opportunity we have a few

148
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,530
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> environments that were</font>

149
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:31,510
monitoring and some of the stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

150
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,849
set up ourselves so one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks</font>

151
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:37,210
mostly power users like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a management</font>

152
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:39,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">network one is end users and then we</font>

153
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:42,219
have some labs and stuff that that we've

154
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,530
set up specifically one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those cuckoo</font>

155
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,840
lab that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just execute samples on all</font>

156
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,489
day and look at the event logs and if

157
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,039
there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> new and interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

158
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,050
go take a deeper look at it but will be

159
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,639
more about that well into the say

160
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,620
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> wunna management networks</font>

161
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,690
also has like a lot of developers so

162
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,919
that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty interesting to</font>

163
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,530
monitor because some of the attacks

164
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,289
coming out using like built-in binaries

165
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:07,840
like ms build can become difficult to

166
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:12,550
detect and people who are developing dot

167
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,960
net and C sharp so sorry yeah so when

168
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,870
you talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about like events</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> per second a</font>

169
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,130
lot a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of anyone who's how to do some</font>

170
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:21,400
architecture or anything like that

171
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:23,650
events per second is always a concern so

172
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,560
just give you a rough idea when you set

173
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">up well you're looking at upwards of</font>

174
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,460
three events per second it could be a

175
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:34,150
lot more though depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the policy</font>

176
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:36,218
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you set up especially in VOD</font>

177
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:39,400
environments like the DISA Stig says

178
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:42,459
enable object access auditing and then

179
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:47,170
it says increase your<font color="#E5E5E5"> max</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> log size to</font>

180
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:48,760
find<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 megabytes larger and then so I</font>

181
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,949
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if anyone's how to do</font>

182
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,740
forensics<font color="#CCCCCC"> where you're receiving boxes</font>

183
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:55,660
from different DoD agencies but a lot of

184
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:59,110
times one of the issues is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

185
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:01,000
enable this auditing and then you only

186
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:04,060
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hours of security logs going</font>

187
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">back so it's like a huge huge thing like</font>

188
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:09,099
they're basically masking any sort of

189
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,800
activity<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ever happened then you can</font>

190
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,930
go in with with shadow volume copies and

191
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,430
made to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back another week or two but</font>

192
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,650
then at the same time you only seen an

193
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,959
eight-hour window so it's a big problem

194
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,870
so make sure your forwarding your event

195
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,209
logs or

196
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:25,100
if you're going to be sad you're

197
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely going to be sad you want to</font>

198
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:34,940
imagine do the things that weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

199
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:37,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know alright so my personal</font>

200
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,020
recommendation is the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> you enable to</font>

201
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,270
keep increasing that size as part of

202
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,000
your testing is like look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

203
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:45,620
takes for these security events to fill

204
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,510
up because you you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

205
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,029
sitting static for forwarding sales you

206
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:53,540
go to the host and oh you only have

207
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:54,589
eight<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours of those out logs you're not</font>

208
00:09:53,540 --> 00:10:00,500
going to be able to do any sort of

209
00:09:54,589 --> 00:10:04,220
research so here's a breakdown this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

210
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:07,130
from cabana and elastic where you can

211
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,290
see security is is the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> beast so this</font>

212
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:13,100
is logarithmic as it goes up it starts

213
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:17,060
going by tens so eight hundred thousand

214
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,430
events for every two hours or like a

215
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,229
network think it was like 200<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

216
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:27,079
reporting and this one how did I was

217
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:29,120
like 600 600 of<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosts reporting in this</font>

218
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,130
specific example so this is over a

219
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,279
business day as you can see there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

220
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,930
not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a jump and events during</font>

221
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:38,779
normal business hours maybe a little bit

222
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:41,479
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> powershell but other than that</font>

223
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:42,709
like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you're looking at</font>

224
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,850
like machine learning and stuff I don't

225
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:46,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there's anything you're going to</font>

226
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:49,910
get out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh there was five more events</font>

227
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:53,630
during this five second period on

228
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:56,750
Tuesday but<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so like I said we have</font>

229
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:58,610
a coupe of our lab to that that we we

230
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:04,070
had set up to start identifying

231
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:06,920
interesting event IDs<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what we do is</font>

232
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:09,980
we pull samples from mouths of you are

233
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:14,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">virus share these sorts of things about</font>

234
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:16,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">500 a day run them through cuckoo lab</font>

235
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:19,459
that we have put some special sauce in

236
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:22,910
there so inelastic

237
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:25,670
it actually has a URI in there that you

238
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:28,610
can click<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it'll take you to the</font>

239
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:30,709
22 information so there's an interesting

240
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">event and there's a new sample something</font>

241
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:35,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting we want to take a look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

242
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:38,929
based off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> event ID we can go in and</font>

243
00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:47,629
then take actual look at that sample to

244
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:50,329
see what what it's doing so just some

245
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:53,809
just some experience a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times we</font>

246
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:56,959
provide this sort of visibility to

247
00:11:53,809 --> 00:12:01,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">windows events to users and analysts who</font>

248
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:04,248
haven't had this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wide post</font>

249
00:12:01,189 --> 00:12:06,230
monitoring before because weapons free

250
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:07,579
so you tell them it's already part of

251
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,889
windows so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go in there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're</font>

252
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:11,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a just quickly few lot of pot of</font>

253
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:13,699
policies and also and you have ten times

254
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:16,189
more awareness of what's going off your

255
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:17,508
endpoint then you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> before and then</font>

256
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:20,959
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what to do with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

257
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:24,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">just keep in mind that this is more of</font>

258
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,359
like like like a hunting sort of thing

259
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,379
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not there's not a lot of stuff</font>

260
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,089
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learn on we're going to get</font>

261
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:32,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">into the stuff you can learn on but a</font>

262
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:34,429
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it is aggregations making</font>

263
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:38,389
comparisons to what happened today

264
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:40,850
versus<font color="#CCCCCC"> yesterday ya doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 day pools</font>

265
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:43,040
for process name and looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

266
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,569
unique sample so and the environments

267
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:50,449
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> run like doing something like</font>

268
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:52,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I'll look at for instance all of</font>

269
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:55,819
our domain admins follow specific naming

270
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:57,259
convention so i'll look for every user

271
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:59,059
that follows that naming convention and

272
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:02,089
look at every process they ran for the

273
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:04,519
last two days<font color="#E5E5E5"> or so and then there's</font>

274
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:06,679
something interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> in there you take</font>

275
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,939
you just take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it so it's not</font>

276
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:10,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a machine is necessarily</font>

277
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:10,569
going to alert on

278
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:15,820
but but as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said before there is some</font>

279
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,840
stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can alert on we'll get</font>

280
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:21,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">into that later so one one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font>

281
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,020
like you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to learn pretty</font>

282
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:30,099
quickly what your baseline looks like

283
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:32,050
what what normal is and so you learn a

284
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot about windows the more you insight</font>

285
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,689
you have on your end points you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

286
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,290
to learn a lot a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font>

287
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:43,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">windows really works on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day to day</font>

288
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:46,510
basis so if you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

289
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,790
interesting an anomaly<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some of these</font>

290
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:51,730
events you know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next step</font>

291
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:55,180
definitely you want to contextualise

292
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:57,730
that event a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the times nein i</font>

293
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,829
receive reports was from a specific

294
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:03,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">group of people that's just like hey</font>

295
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,810
this event happened and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> like okay</font>

296
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,220
well did you go and see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what else</font>

297
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,979
happened on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that box that day or what</font>

298
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:11,080
else that<font color="#CCCCCC"> user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did that day or anything</font>

299
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:14,740
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no but this</font>

300
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:18,220
looks weird so yeah I definitely want to

301
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:27,250
go back start putting contacts behind

302
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:29,830
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> event so and another thing too so</font>

303
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:34,210
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a reminder like law windows logs</font>

304
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:36,640
can be fragile so it's looking every

305
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:38,620
other artifact when you're doing a

306
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:44,740
forensic investigation so it's really

307
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:46,180
nice to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have sort of these client</font>

308
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,620
monitoring solutions are going together

309
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,050
so if you already have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

310
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:53,860
carbon block or something like that on

311
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:56,890
your end point it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely probably</font>

312
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:59,160
worth looking at enabling WEP or

313
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,839
something like it because

314
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,449
if you have the more tools you have a

315
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,100
green with one another the stronger<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

316
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:07,620
the stronger your gut<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling is going</font>

317
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,019
to be about what happened on on your

318
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">host that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's an incident so you</font>

319
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:15,269
definitely want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have as much stuff as</font>

320
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:17,339
agreeing as possible so anyways log

321
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:19,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">singh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me fragile though so it can be</font>

322
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:24,360
permission changes on the files people

323
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:26,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">can change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> timestamps the disk of the on</font>

324
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:30,149
the draw on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host can become</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> full and</font>

325
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:32,910
they'll start spend out 5 21 errors and

326
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:34,980
things like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

327
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:42,089
kind of interesting so if windows cannot

328
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:44,339
log something it logs something<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

329
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:48,899
so this is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> like fisher-price</font>

330
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:52,709
level event ID<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4688 so this stuff is</font>

331
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:54,990
right out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cuckoo lab that we run yeah</font>

332
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:57,329
this is all bad so if you haven't ever

333
00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:01,319
seen bad before if you see something

334
00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:03,180
like this on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> host it's not good it's</font>

335
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:05,550
not good you you might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

336
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:10,500
friend who knows a little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

337
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:12,149
what to do so you're not familiar with

338
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,069
some of this like<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell with</font>

339
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:17,399
execution policy bypass that's like

340
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:21,000
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> powershell shouldn't be able</font>

341
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">to run stuff on your on your host went</font>

342
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,199
by default you have to catch the

343
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:28,500
execution policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> bypass to do it every</font>

344
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:31,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">PowerShell module that's offensive</font>

345
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,540
pretty much has this statement and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

346
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:35,519
so you can flag on it a lot of

347
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,639
legitimate stuff does too but it's easy

348
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:45,480
to filter out once you get once you see

349
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:47,189
your baseline another thing that you'll

350
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,980
see and again this is all from the

351
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:54,779
things a little clearer on the next page

352
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:57,329
yeah so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all again from cuckoo</font>

353
00:16:54,779 --> 00:17:00,269
this these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all droppers a lot of</font>

354
00:16:57,329 --> 00:17:05,188
them are ransomware droppers they all

355
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:07,380
love to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> W skripsi script it's easy</font>

356
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:11,400
simple sleep and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what's kind of</font>

357
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:14,190
interesting is that the visual basic

358
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:18,630
and languages like it's at windows

359
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:20,160
understands as a default and so that's I

360
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,510
mean some of the original pieces of

361
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,550
malware that really started floating

362
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:25,410
around was it's all it's been bringing

363
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:28,560
the same stuff same type of language

364
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:30,120
visual basics for over a long time so

365
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,540
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting that ransomware and</font>

366
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:39,060
stuff for these droppers going back to

367
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:43,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">these strips</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so we said a</font>

368
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:47,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit about talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about apt so</font>

369
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:51,240
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a sample that we had that was a</font>

370
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:54,180
deep and a confirmed sample where they

371
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,950
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is all public</font>

372
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,140
knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> assault it's out there and</font>

373
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:04,140
available but they<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically masked are</font>

374
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:06,570
like BPM and the it's a dropper right so

375
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,120
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have droppers you always going</font>

376
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:12,120
to have some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of event and</font>

377
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,280
especially if they're it's a fish

378
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:18,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">fishing email means that there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

379
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,410
to be a windows event on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> box and</font>

380
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:25,680
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have four six eight</font>

381
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:27,690
events so up here this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for 688 you</font>

382
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,370
know process names that don't end an exe

383
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:33,330
that's that might be something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

384
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:36,239
flag on for<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance and then as you can</font>

385
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:38,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">see down here will maybe not because</font>

386
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,900
maybe the projectors blocking a little

387
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:47,879
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they added their persistence was</font>

388
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:52,590
a media center<font color="#CCCCCC"> exe as scheduled task</font>

389
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:54,420
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry right here it's a registry</font>

390
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:58,770
under current version run at a media

391
00:18:54,420 --> 00:19:01,950
center so there's definitely things that

392
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:04,530
you can flag on even with these apt

393
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,720
advanced threats like a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

394
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:09,810
think windows<font color="#E5E5E5"> is useless but especially</font>

395
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,420
with these droppers as always there's

396
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:15,570
always some sort of artifact I mean this

397
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:18,390
that that sample stood out like you know

398
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:21,149
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing stack counting reversing or</font>

399
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:24,060
you know sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> by like Lisa currents and</font>

400
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,990
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I probably pulled 120</font>

401
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,610
days these

402
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,200
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things would stand out running</font>

403
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,629
like four or five six and thirty two

404
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:34,170
commands but he said eh sees that don't

405
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:36,750
end in exe right so it I mean stuff like

406
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:43,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is pretty fisher-price is apt just</font>

407
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:46,170
assume nobody has<font color="#CCCCCC"> this monitoring so</font>

408
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,200
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also from the lab coo coo lab so</font>

409
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:52,170
there's a sample that shut off event

410
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:58,260
logging so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know you can monitor for</font>

411
00:19:52,170 --> 00:20:01,380
1100 or system 104 the problem being

412
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:04,260
that when the computer shuts down can

413
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:07,020
also cause this event I so just keep

414
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:15,450
that in mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're looking for it</font>

415
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:18,090
yeah so adding local admin here's a

416
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:23,250
sample from the lab that added the

417
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:25,919
account guest account and so basically

418
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:29,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">the type of pool that you do is look for</font>

419
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,620
all 4722 events and then look at the

420
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,629
accounting that was at it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then a pc</font>

421
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:36,239
one that doesn't rhyme if you see a

422
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:40,410
celebrity name and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there a user Whoopi</font>

423
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,750
Goldberg for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance maybe that be yet</font>

424
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:45,330
you know true story we have a user in

425
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:47,309
one of our networks it's like Michael

426
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,290
Phelps was was his name I saw and I was

427
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:54,210
like oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> god that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the world</font>

428
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:56,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah but uh I was because I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

429
00:20:54,210 --> 00:21:05,610
expecting it to be to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a real user but</font>

430
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:09,360
it was so not a big deal good so a lot

431
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:12,719
of hotness who may be back in 2015<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

432
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:17,100
this year two people<font color="#E5E5E5"> or 2016 people talk</font>

433
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:20,040
about wmi after a black hat<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

434
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:23,370
conference 2015 kind of became the big

435
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:28,379
deal some apt groups started using it so

436
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:30,840
windows it logs wmi which is windows

437
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:34,169
management and basically it's like

438
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:36,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">sequel statements sequel s statements</font>

439
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:38,210
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are using to query your</font>

440
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:42,140
computer or

441
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:43,820
to add certain functionalities to it

442
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:47,480
take away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this functionality et</font>

443
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:50,840
cetera but the big one so for malware

444
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,850
especially droppers if you're looking at

445
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,310
anti analysis a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them will use</font>

446
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:59,300
this to see what antivirus product is

447
00:21:55,310 --> 00:22:03,710
running on a computer or which so pull

448
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:06,470
from the bios and see if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have vmware</font>

449
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:08,270
in the butt and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're anywhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

450
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:11,060
you're in the bios dump that it pulled

451
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:15,470
so a lot of times they screw this up

452
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:16,909
luckily so w my activity it'll show up

453
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:19,400
in there this is some stuff on the lab

454
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:22,850
that the droppers messed up their

455
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:26,750
statement and it ended up getting caught

456
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:32,179
so if you want if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want a little bit</font>

457
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:34,910
more insight this is this is new people

458
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:39,740
are just<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting getting into look at</font>

459
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:42,200

461
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:51,140
verbose and Matt Swan from Microsoft he

462
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:54,320
wrote a wrapper for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Messer if you're</font>

463
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:57,050
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> and doing some supercool deep</font>

464
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,540
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what's going on your host</font>

465
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:03,950
take a look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

466
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:05,480
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk but take a look at for</font>

467
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,010
yourself and see if you might be able to

468
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,700
implement in your in your environment

469
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:15,920
but so I've been tracing some stuff

470
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:18,710
though is available<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for instance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

473
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,330

00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,130
people using<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet Explorer so you</font>

475
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,050
can pull if you're a Red Team you can

476
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:34,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">pull username and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> passwords out of that</font>

477
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:37,300
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to do any sort of fancy</font>

478
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,920
hooking of Internet Explorer you can

479
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:45,370
live off the land<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft has its</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">built-in so enjoy whatever cyber point</font>

481
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:49,780
gets into it take a look at our blog if

482
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,460
you're if you're a red team or you might

483
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:56,410
find it interesting the other thing is

484
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:59,830
is that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with a bench racing for</font>

USB devices basically it's a key

486
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:04,960
basically you the guys at<font color="#E5E5E5"> some point</font>

487
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:10,510
we're at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tool that will decipher the</font>

488
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:12,250
trace log for the USB channels and turn

489
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:16,450
it into a keylogger so every keystroke

490
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:18,730
that the user does is logged potentially

491
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,280
you have to enable it but its built-in

492
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:26,800
by default key logger and the windows

493

using of entries for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows but so fish</font>

the fisher-price the easiest way the

499
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:49,270
someone got the select all from win32

501
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:57,760
and this one I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> caught by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> w my</font>

502
00:24:53,740 --> 00:25:02,020
operational log but as you can see it

503
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:06,190
got caught in its<font color="#CCCCCC"> of nid 11 and then</font>

504
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:09,190
these w my activity of nids are all over

505
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:13,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> place but so this is remote wmi of</font>

506
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:17,080
nid one and it logs the user who did it

507
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:18,940
and the command they ran so and this is

508
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,889
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just wrote i ran this one myself</font>

509
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:23,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">i didn't have a sample to do though so i</font>

510
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:27,190
just pulled all the information about

511
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">the operating system on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> host and but</font>

512
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,580
it would it all gets logged and you can

513
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:34,960
query it if you have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

514
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:36,999
elastic helping you out so in the

515
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:43,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">blackout talk</font>

516
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:48,279
they talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about adding classes for a</font>

517
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:49,958
persistent so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> also gets logged as</font>

518
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:51,069
you can see is that there's some

519
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:57,309
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there that might give it</font>

520
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:59,379
away put class and I gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a pretty</font>

521
00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:02,439
obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> theme but yeah because I call</font>

522
00:25:59,379 --> 00:26:04,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">the evil class as an example but um if</font>

523
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:06,639
you if you go in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look this so this</font>

524
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:08,109
doesn't really happen all that often

525
00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:11,498
maybe if someone's installing software

526
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:14,319
it might happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you can definitely</font>

527
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:16,569
easily create an aggregation for this

528
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:19,389
and just take a look last 30 days what

529
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:23,438
new classes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> W we're out of via WI so</font>

530
00:26:19,389 --> 00:26:27,819
this one's called Adobe Reader w my

531
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:29,979
class<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we do be duly readers part of</font>

532
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:32,019
our image so probably shouldn't be

533
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:35,319
installing a new class should already be

534
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:38,289
installed so cool suspicious stuff like

535
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:41,829
that they also had a persistence

536
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:46,929
mechanism using actually using<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows</font>

537
00:26:41,829 --> 00:26:50,769
event<font color="#CCCCCC"> logs by pushing up consumer so</font>

538
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:52,749
basically the consumer says the way that

539
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:57,069
it works in windows is if you see this

540
00:26:52,749 --> 00:27:01,299
event log do this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this commit this</font>

541
00:26:57,069 --> 00:27:03,309
process or this file handles out so the

542
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:08,139
persistence mechanism was creating one

543
00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:12,819
of these consumers and giving in a

544
00:27:08,139 --> 00:27:14,708
malicious file to to do it so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

545
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:17,408
execute when they're one of the specific

546
00:27:14,709 --> 00:27:18,759
if that happens so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ran I did once</font>

547
00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:21,129
again I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a sample</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that do this so I</font>

548
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:22,419
ran myself call it evil consumers and

549
00:27:21,129 --> 00:27:29,019
make it blatantly obvious to everyone

550
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:35,729
here but you know it gets logged and

551
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:35,729
then so another thing you can do is

552
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:45,510
with web and GP and through GPO if you

553
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:47,760
want to run some sort of mass query on

554
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:50,850
your network and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> those results back</font>

555
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,039
without having to write that client

556
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:57,719
server infrastructure you can just

557
00:27:53,039 --> 00:28:00,629
hijack windows event<font color="#E5E5E5"> forwarding so like</font>

558
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,600
for instance if you want to run get

559
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:06,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">process</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nuts that or get w my object on</font>

560
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:10,620
every one your host every 30 seconds and

561
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:13,379
forward it to your sim with<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows</font>

562
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:16,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">event forwarding and a couple of</font>

563
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:20,700
PowerShell classes or command 'let's

564
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:23,039
sorry you can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do that so just</font>

565
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,679
create a new event log and then write to

566
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,990
it with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the message of that as</font>

567
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,510
analog being the output of your script

568
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:32,700
or what you found interesting and

569
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:34,470
they'll all get forwarded to your sim if

570
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:43,470
you have left set up and you subscribe

571
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:45,179
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> those channels</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this just</font>

572
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:48,720
to speak on like one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adam said</font>

573
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:50,190
that we just to go further into like

574
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,710
what you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is Windows Event log</font>

575
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:55,950
specially the tracing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the HTTPS</font>

576
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:58,440
we've discussed like potentially using

577
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:01,620
that as an equivalent<font color="#E5E5E5"> or replacement for</font>

578
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,570
like an<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL decrypter obviously granted</font>

579
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:06,539
the risk of like storing those things in

580
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:08,820
logs but you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> override them</font>

581
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:10,530
to rotate them fast enough you know it's

582
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,629
an accepted risk obviously if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

583
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:15,389
decrypting as<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS in the first place</font>

584
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:16,830
you're taking an accepted risk so you

585
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,140
know I'd rather have one user read

586
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:22,559
somebody else's cookies then you know

587
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:25,049
miss<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything right so wait seventy</font>

588
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:28,200
eighty percent of your traffic also with

589
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:33,030
HTTPS is like again environments where

590
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:35,880
like you know if anybody's ever tried to

591
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:38,399
do attitude<font color="#E5E5E5"> on 1x or SSL decryption you</font>

592
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,220
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that getting somebody to</font>

593
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:44,130
push a root CA or CA<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can basically</font>

594
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:47,340
be authoritative every site is is pretty

595
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:49,539
difficult so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just Power Cell</font>

596
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:53,228
version 5 again from the lab

597
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:57,669
basically copying executable<font color="#CCCCCC"> into memory</font>

598
00:29:53,229 --> 00:29:59,919
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to speak on like why we ran the</font>

599
00:29:57,669 --> 00:30:01,419
lab we ran the lab basically because you

600
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,950
know we only<font color="#E5E5E5"> had like a thousand host or</font>

601
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:05,679
less and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are like</font>

602
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:08,859
competent or yeah they're competent

603
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:11,139
technical people so you know they're not

604
00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:12,609
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them run ad blockers and those</font>

605
00:30:11,139 --> 00:30:15,369
sort of things like they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

606
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:16,989
installing hardly any programs if they

607
00:30:15,369 --> 00:30:20,109
do most of them know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run into vm</font>

608
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:21,729
so we we really did push on the cuckoo

609
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:23,859
sandbox to supplement the fact they're

610
00:30:21,729 --> 00:30:27,399
like okay what we're doing actually

611
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:30,220
works so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get in the last</font>

612
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:34,359
couple slides are going to be the why I

613
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:36,460
say even if you have carbon black or sis

614
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:41,529
mon or those other things why you should

615
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:43,029
use web because you know it there are

616
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:44,919
certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> West will log that</font>

617
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:46,359
none of those will not that they don't

618
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:50,440
work or anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

619
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:53,168
sauce but you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of stuff</font>

620
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:56,739
that like you know lateral movement in

621
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:58,210
insider I consider an insider somebody

622
00:30:56,739 --> 00:31:00,460
who's an outsider is doing lateral

623
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:03,580
movement they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> just passed the step</font>

624
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:08,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">of sending your HR department you know</font>

625
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:10,330
resume dot PDF dot exe so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're now</font>

626
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:12,159
have legitimate credentials you have to

627
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,478
treat them the same maybe some of you

628
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,830
with some science degree or something

629
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:16,539
will disagree with me but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

630
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:22,149
I treat it and it's worked out for us

631
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:24,249
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to note like so people talk</font>

632
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:26,738
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like canary or honey pot like</font>

633
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:28,149
credentials<font color="#E5E5E5"> and files which I think</font>

634
00:31:26,739 --> 00:31:31,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're great you should do we haven't</font>

635
00:31:28,149 --> 00:31:32,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">got into it too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much again because we're</font>

636
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:35,259
assuming that somebody already has

637
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:39,549
legitimate credentials and so what we'll

638
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:42,460
do is basically run lots of queries on

639
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:45,009
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> keywords of somebody who is</font>

640
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:46,119
essentially performing like they've made

641
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:48,399
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and they're performing</font>

642
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:50,470
reconnaissance because you have all your

643
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,418
Visio diagrams your IP subnet list

644
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically everybody can access on one</font>

645
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:56,649
share charge which isn't necessarily bad

646
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:58,179
right like it's better to your guys to

647
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:58,989
know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your network than not but</font>

648
00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:01,570
it's

649
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:03,760
so easy to take advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of and live</font>

650
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:05,950
off the land but at the same time it's

651
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:09,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">very easy to monitor that this person</font>

652
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:11,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">opened up 60 Visio diagrams and again</font>

653
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,629
following an account scheme he's a

654
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:15,460
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy or he's a system admin why</font>

655
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:18,760
is he reading every<font color="#CCCCCC"> network diagram on</font>

656
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:21,250
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP in mpls like that he probably</font>

657
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:26,410
doesn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it did so this one</font>

658
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:28,960
from a blog harm joy so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what</font>

659
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:32,050
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives you is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to control</font>

660
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,450
all users and again this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the</font>

661
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:36,790
event ID if I ran the query up at the

662
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:38,500
top it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> only be the malicious thing</font>

663
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:40,480
what these flies i'm going to show you

664
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 30-day queries with basically no</font>

665
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,530
filtering this should show you how easy

666
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:46,540
it is you know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

667
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:48,790
about false positives and this and that

668
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:51,940
and you not agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that was with</font>

669
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:54,370
with signatures and stuff but you know

670
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:57,280
if it takes you like for example when

671
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:59,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">java was like the big thing for exploit</font>

672
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,330
kids like I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like writing these</font>

673
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:03,520
signatures is worthless like so I spent

674
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:05,710
a week basically whitelisting legitimate

675
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Java usage so in fact they even get rid</font>

676
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,160
of life signatures like you know don't

677
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:11,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">make all you people do this but if they</font>

678
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,300
don't mind somebody like me who who

679
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,429
thinks you know logs are sexy like you

680
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:20,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">know don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make let them do it you know</font>

681
00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:22,390
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> who cares so this is one was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

682
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,800
171,000 events before I did the

683
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:25,179
filtering right there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one simple</font>

684
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,090
filtering up at the top and the red

685
00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:31,330
microsoft recommends it does not running

686
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:33,070
anything malicious but again if I were

687
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:36,639
running according at the top you should

688
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:40,149
all be oh crap alerts like this is what

689
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,710
harm joy and pyro tech have been talking

690
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,330
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> with like Kerberos and other stuff</font>

691
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,770
but basically you know allowing

692
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:47,530
efficient hash cracking like<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

693
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:48,940
efficient like our c4 or sort of stuff

694
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:51,129
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> distorting the passwords in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clear</font>

695
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">text period right like this modulus</font>

696
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:55,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">sourcing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to catch</font>

697
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:57,280
this like and again not to those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

698
00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:58,690
are great like but these are somebody's

699
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,580
already made in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network and they're</font>

700
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:02,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing what these folks call like a</font>

00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:05,439
sneaky back door this is another one

702
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:08,469
service principal<font color="#E5E5E5"> named basically giving</font>

703
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,909
you the right to control another user

00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:11,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">account so the other one was every user</font>

705
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:12,109

account

707
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:17,629
so obviously didn't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on my network</font>

708
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:19,518
created ran the attack myself with wolf

00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:22,819
in sheep up in the top on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top right</font>

710
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:24,408
again 30 days and I've done no filtering

711
00:34:22,819 --> 00:34:26,779
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eve NID if I were to do the</font>

712
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:28,579
filtering basically will filter down the

715
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:36,558
basically less than 200 events it would

716
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:40,429
take me three seconds to find that right

717
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:43,489
so again<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the second time we have not</font>

718
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:45,079
scratched the surface like they're just

00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:02,150
for like you know 10 gig plus so you

727
00:34:58,549 --> 00:35:05,089
know there's we all talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it later</font>

728
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:07,039
but few other things so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">PowerShell five enabled module logging</font>

730
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:11,809
great you know this would bypass well

00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:14,660
pretty simple windows powershell the

732
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:16,430
original one you can either a lot of

733
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,769
times like people run and<font color="#E5E5E5"> power up and</font>

734
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:20,629
Power View and those sort of things even

00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:22,669
with version<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 they'll throw some errors</font>

736
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:24,710
more than likely or you could just do a

737
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:28,339
query you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerShell engine version</font>

746
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:48,799
and again like you know you might get a

747
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:51,078
few maybe a few million in a day but

748
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:53,720
again it's usually something like

749
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:56,779
microsoft office activation a day of

750
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:59,118
filtering and you should easily be able

751
00:35:56,779 --> 00:36:02,269
to catch something like this and here<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

not<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not victim-blaming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them this</font>

this securities<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard like it is very</font>

754
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:11,329
hard again you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you have</font>

755
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:13,819
people logging in so this is weak

756
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:15,680
passwords the one was enabling it well

757
00:36:13,819 --> 00:36:20,808
what if it's already enabled how do you

758
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:23,299
detect that should be yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 768 or if</font>

759
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:24,560
they mated 4624 to you know people use

760
00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:26,600

763
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:33,830
so what I'll probably do is crazy

00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:36,109
something in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system all that all</font>

00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:04,730
sort of things anytime there's a

modification like you should know right

803
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:09,410
we create a powershell script to

804
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:11,509
basically say all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosts that have</font>

hours four hours 24 hours whatever you

807
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:19,130
want and then compare<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to the unique</font>

have a hundred host not checking in well

810
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:24,290
so we're going to push the group policy

811
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,480
through anything with authenticated

812

00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:36,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">this another one create alerts for like</font>

I go we're receiving no events like that

817
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,350
is kindergarten monitoring like you

should know if you're not receiving any

<font color="#E5E5E5">that creating a subscription the West</font>

we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can monitor the other subscriptions</font>

833
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:23,640
and then for the West River itself it

834
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:27,570
has an<font color="#E5E5E5"> event collector channel I'm I</font>

help and you should help period right

856
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,650
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not above your insecurities</font>

857
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,060
or not above anything you're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

team protecting the same company

859
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:21,900
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got them said increase the</font>

860
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:24,180
large size you know we do 500 megs or

861
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:28,530
more you know if you're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

862
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:30,720
hard disk<font color="#E5E5E5"> space and yeah you caught that</font>

863
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:33,600
if you're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of hard disk space</font>

864
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:37,770
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i feel sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for you since</font>

865
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:39,299

866
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:43,290
again working with<font color="#CCCCCC"> helpdesk getting</font>

867
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:44,910
access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ticketing system so i was</font>

868
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:47,180
doing it an actual investigation where

869
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:50,180
some really weird programs ran

870
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:52,098
some some services installed and within

871
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,868
a matter of like two minutes are they

872
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:55,819
were d conflicted by accessing the

873
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:58,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">helpdesk and seeing that one of the</font>

00:40:55,819 --> 00:41:01,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">system's admins was troubleshooting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

875
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:05,329
hard hard drive like that is invaluable

876
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:06,890
of time that saves me<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours right not</font>

877
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:08,270
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I've had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to investigate that</font>

878
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:10,250
computer i would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to investigate</font>

879
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:12,440
every other computer that user logged in

880
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:15,710
and it just becomes a nightmare again

881
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,720
create unique subscriptions we do one

882
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:20,569
specifically for security Channel and we

883
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:23,480
send this basically Microsoft has<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

884
00:41:20,569 --> 00:41:27,680
high bandwidth sending or like Senate as

885
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:30,559
fast as possible other things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might</font>

886
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,390
not want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know some people I guess</font>

887
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:34,069
have liked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Meg links and you know</font>

888
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:35,720
some remote country and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

889
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:38,569
the monitoring in the United States or

890
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:43,009
something and so they can't but if you

891
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:44,779
can send things as fast as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible this</font>

892
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:47,390
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a recommendation for those</font>

893
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:50,540
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network cabinet or</font>

894
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:51,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking all our bandwidth so and even</font>

895
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the security channel you can</font>

896
00:41:51,799 --> 00:41:57,290
subscribe<font color="#E5E5E5"> to specific event ID so like</font>

897
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:59,180
you know 1102 event log clears like

898
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:01,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">unless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody's running CC cleaner</font>

899
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:04,160
which part shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be any ways but in</font>

900
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:06,558
avid networks they are basically do

901
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,118
whatever they want you know you should

902
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:10,970
know right away somebody's clearing

903
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:12,500
event logs custom software to create

904
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:14,209
subscriptions for that so like people

905
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask this mod installed trace the</font>

906
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:20,359
description just<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that I ran into</font>

907
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:23,089
everyone's wow there's no no reason why

908
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:25,609
you can't figure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out but where if one</font>

909
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:27,470
of the channels airs and the rest of

910
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:29,390
those subscriptions air so you're

911
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:31,609
subscribing to every channel in that one

912
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:32,990
error and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that computer doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have it</font>

913
00:42:31,609 --> 00:42:35,000
those other channels my air and you

914
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:37,279
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not get the stuff so for custom</font>

915
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,130
software<font color="#CCCCCC"> crazy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> subscription just for</font>

916
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,540
that just a side note we've only been

917
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:44,660
doing this in windows 7 environment

918
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:46,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">Windows 10 is essentially the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same well</font>

919
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:48,740
actually yeah it didn't add a whole lot

920
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:51,290
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> new events they just added a like one</font>

921
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:54,109
or two extra pieces of data in the

922
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:55,730
events but they I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

923
00:42:54,109 --> 00:42:57,558
the process command line already and

924
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:59,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">given you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time</font>

925
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:02,420
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world but they start logging like</font>

926
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:04,880
when the system boots windows seven does

927
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:07,970
not so you actually never see system dot

928
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,020
exe install or start which would be nice

929
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:11,390
because then you can basically alert

930
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:13,670
like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> not PID for then we got a</font>

931
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:16,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem because system exe is always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PID</font>

932
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:20,119
for if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get real crazy real</font>

933
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:22,940
paranoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

934
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:27,890
to be with this you can encrypt the log

935
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:29,869
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> PGP you know bandwidth you can limit</font>

936
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:35,150
the resources based on the number of

937
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:36,500
events or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU and Adam kind of</font>

938
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:39,500
touched on this like machine learning

939
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,609
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know for windows event logs people</font>

940
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,020
who are a lot smarter than me and

941
00:43:40,609 --> 00:43:44,750
running a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of larger environments</font>

942
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,920
kind of agree because<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do you tell</font>

943
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">the difference to somebody testing new</font>

944
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,010
software and somebody installing<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

945
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:51,680
malicious<font color="#CCCCCC"> p software that's never been</font>

946
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:53,480
seen but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go and set it up in an</font>

947
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,660
environment that's already been deployed

948
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">like how do you know that your machine</font>

949
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:01,250
learning is not baselining malware

950
00:43:58,549 --> 00:44:04,250
that's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> running for so long that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

951
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:07,849
is now baseline as legitimate so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

952
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:10,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">one-off you know work with a lot of</font>

953
00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:14,720
network admins<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was one but jump boxes</font>

954
00:44:10,549 --> 00:44:16,549
are just a lazy solution to create one

955
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,220
any any instead of like a bunch of any

956
00:44:16,549 --> 00:44:21,829
any rules and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just an easy way to</font>

957
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:24,890
steal other people's smart card readers

958
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:26,660
that are logged in you know not only

959
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:28,670
everybody's probably storing passwords

960
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:30,950
in their desktop so once you get system

961
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:33,109
and can read their stuff but definitely

962
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:34,339
like going even beyond that which you

963
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:36,348
probably don't need to but reading

964
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:38,029
memory of like everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> logging into</font>

965
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:40,130
all those routers and firewalls with

966
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:43,400
secure CRT and<font color="#E5E5E5"> putty in those things</font>

967
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:44,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it's ridiculous don't enable John</font>

968
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,059
boxes maybe somebody knows why they're

969
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,640
better than not but let me know i'd like

970
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:53,690
to know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stop spilling something</font>

971
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:57,020
wrong but in the last thing run your<font color="#E5E5E5"> sim</font>

972
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:59,569
run your database if you can you know

973
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:01,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">you may be wearing a tinfoil hat doing</font>

974
00:44:59,569 --> 00:45:05,599
this but for some people they have to is

975
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:08,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">is basically run it on a different ad</font>

976
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,080
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment and don't run</font>

977
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:12,080
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> vm</font>

978
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:15,020
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> esxi server or the virtual</font>

979
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,580
environment that people can log into

980
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,720
with active directory that you're

981
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,759
monitoring like does that make sense

982
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:22,250
like so basically you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume</font>

983
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,200
that like if you're if you can access

984
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,460
any vm you can do anything to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that right</font>

985
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can copy the memory you can delete</font>

986
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:32,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">it all sorts of things like just just</font>

987
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:34,220
don't do this and again we're I don't

988
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:35,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">pretend to be very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smart I don't really</font>

989
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:37,310
know a whole lot that's been doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

990
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:40,130
in my spare time<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the third</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time I've</font>

991
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:44,060
yet to even scratch the surface I'm a

992
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:46,850
lot like this llama you know we we want

993
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:49,279
to help maybe somebody in this room

994
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:50,839
knows that I can tend to be an

995
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">aggressive person but only because I'm</font>

996
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:55,700
passionate but I love to learn from

997
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:57,529
other people that's how I started even

998
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:59,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're smart if you're smart and you</font>

999
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:00,200
think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help the people</font>

1000
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,430
that don't know anything you're

1001
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,710
obviously not smarter than your

1002
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:05,569
obviously stupid enough to realize at

1003
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:09,350
one point you didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything so</font>

1004
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:11,240
since you know I'll probably wrap up

1005
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:12,620
about five or six<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes short and I'm</font>

1006
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,089
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go over all this I'm</font>

1007
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:17,750
eventually going to disseminate the

1008
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:20,150
slides but these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone off doing</font>

1009
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:22,790
help desk at one point I thought at the

1010
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:26,570
same time being the windows admin which

1011
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:30,110
is mildly depressing is you know like

1012
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:32,480
make their policies apply every time

1013
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:33,620
every x amount of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you're</font>

1014
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,760
like oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> we change the desktop</font>

1015
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:36,170
background well they can still change

1016
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,630
the desktop background but then like

1017
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:40,040
when the policy refresh it there's

1018
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,750
certain settings by default if it

1019
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,400
doesn't change don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply that policy</font>

1020
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:45,230
like if the group policy itself doesn't

1021
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,300
change it doesn't check if the desktop

1022
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:48,590
has changed and they installed you know

1023
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,960
put a picture and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're in the front</font>

1024
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:54,200
lobby and you know now you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1025
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:57,680
have a real problem with bottom one the

1026
00:46:54,200 --> 00:47:01,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">bottom one is important it's very</font>

1027
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:04,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">important there could be a superseding</font>

1028
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:07,220
or whatever policy that's brought that

1029
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:11,540
doesn't have the more specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

1030
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:14,540
enabled and I will<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually override the</font>

1031
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:16,640
broader of things some resources again

1032
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:19,850
disseminate this stuff there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no point</font>

1033
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:24,410
in reading<font color="#CCCCCC"> for HTTP sides and</font>

1034
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:27,230
see ya last thing all these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1035
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:29,149
push notifications from my phone I got

1036
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:30,350
to the point where falling like five or

1037
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:32,120
six<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred blogs and following a</font>

1038
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:33,710
thousand people on Twitter I don't

1039
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,029
follow vendor accounts I fall to

1040
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:38,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually with people who do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff</font>

1041
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:41,180
and at this point just having a kid and

1042
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:42,560
all that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know trying to be</font>

1043
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:44,180

1044
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,070
to read half<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I used to</font>

1045
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:48,770
have push notifications for all these

1046

1048
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:57,290
sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff but there's all related to</font>

1049
00:47:53,480 --> 00:48:00,320
windows stuff in some sense right you

1050

1065
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,250
literally cannot learn everything and

1066
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:50,930
the more you<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn the more you realize</font>

1067
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:55,060
you have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea what the heck you're</font>

00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:14,250
manually by going into<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows manage</font>

1071
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,170
yeah absolutely you can so I

1072
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:17,880
neighborhood on my own computer even

1073
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:20,280
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know why it's running the</font>

1074
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:23,580
p.m.<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i only use it to rdp and the</font>

1075
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:26,760
stuff or<font color="#CCCCCC"> connected like a VPN but yeah</font>

1076
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:28,590
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go into windows manager you</font>

1077
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,450
just basically like right click on the

1078
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:33,390
event long as you want properties and

1079
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:49,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">overwrite you know don't override change</font>

1080
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:54,450
the file size those sort of things yeah

1081
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:55,920
yeah yeah so we have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that so he</font>

1082
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:58,649
asked what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are you doing the</font>

1083
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:02,400
case of like remote users some you don't

1084
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:06,090
have necessarily like a byob BYOD but

1085
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:10,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">not not byob sorry that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later BYOD</font>

1086
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:13,260
bring your own device so that's

1087
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:17,790
basically a risk we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have accepted and</font>

1088
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:19,470
hopefully you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the where our</font>

1089
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:21,390
resources are like you have to take a

1090
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:23,040
like an assessment of your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1091
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:24,900
there's a really even matter if somebody

1092
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,790
compromises<font color="#E5E5E5"> it ad maybe it doesn't even</font>

1093
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,720
matter who knows but like maybe it's

1094
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,490
more important<font color="#E5E5E5"> your intellectual</font>

1095
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,830
property that's stored on a linux server

1096
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:35,700
like an ad<font color="#E5E5E5"> server is only used for like</font>

1097
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:37,620
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know like a few</font>

1098
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,000
janitors to log in to some computers

1099
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:40,560
that night when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll have anything to do</font>

1100
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,270
or security guards or something like

1101
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:45,180
that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're probably care less</font>

1102
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:47,880
right focus<font color="#CCCCCC"> your efforts somewhere else</font>

1103
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:49,980
that matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we basically accept that</font>

1104
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,240
risk I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these are</font>

1105
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:54,120
keeping up at night and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to like</font>

1106
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:56,790
try to care about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1107
00:50:54,120 --> 00:51:00,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">od just protect assets that you can and</font>

1108
00:50:56,790 --> 00:51:02,820
that are most important if it's if BYOD

1109
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:06,810
nor storing all the important data on it

1110
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:10,230
which it might be you know gotta find

1111
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:13,770
out another way right like 47 of VPN in

1112
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:18,090
and not allow basic file transfer you

1113
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:20,069
know try right don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it easy you</font>

1114
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:22,199
know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave the door open always</font>

1115
00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:33,119
we can pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> the locker to brand the door</font>

1116
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:36,809
so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a good question not yeah</font>

1117
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:41,009
yeah so I'm a not an elastic searching

1118
00:51:36,809 --> 00:51:43,979
elasticsearch spokesperson but having

1119
00:51:41,009 --> 00:51:46,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">hope into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the database a lot yeah our</font>

1120
00:51:43,979 --> 00:51:49,019
site definitely has that problem it's

1121
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:51,479
still great obviously but you know we

1122
00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:54,089
love free plastic search is free you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1123
00:51:51,479 --> 00:51:55,828
pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> their third support if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

1124
00:51:54,089 --> 00:51:57,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some environments you have to have it</font>

1125
00:51:55,829 --> 00:51:58,949
but yeah I know a lot of people have had

1126
00:51:57,719 --> 00:52:00,329
that problem we've had that problem in

1127
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:03,029
our side but the thing with elastic

1128
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:06,329
search if you can you can generate the

1129
00:52:03,029 --> 00:52:07,619
fields dynamically but what which I

1130
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:09,359
actually haven't gotten to yet but with

1131
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:11,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">other logs I have as you can basically</font>

1132
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:13,170
create your own analyzers so like I

1133
00:52:11,489 --> 00:52:14,729
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done it for Windows logs because</font>

1134
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:17,489
there's so many and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't needed to</font>

1135
00:52:14,729 --> 00:52:20,368
but elastic search index is at right

1136
00:52:17,489 --> 00:52:22,739
time so the reason it's so fast is

1137
00:52:20,369 --> 00:52:24,059
because it basically already has the

1138
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:26,339
answer to the question you're going to

1139
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:27,930
ask which you know okay great i don't

1140
00:52:26,339 --> 00:52:30,390
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> like five times compression and this</font>

1141
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:33,029
and that but let's be honest like like

1142
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:35,219
data storage is so cheap<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if it's</font>

1143
00:52:33,029 --> 00:52:37,109
free instead of paying 150 million

1144
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:39,059
dollars for spunk like<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend 50 million</font>

1145
00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:41,038
dollars if you want to do paeonia spend

1146
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:43,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 unlike this massive amounts of</font>

1147
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:45,869
servers with massive amounts of storage

1148
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:47,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">right like it's a no-brainer so I'll</font>

1149
00:52:45,869 --> 00:52:49,410
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's answer your question yeah</font>

1150
00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:52,049
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can say i'm not a spokesperson</font>

1151
00:52:49,410 --> 00:53:11,129
but it's free you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's no reason</font>

1152
00:52:52,049 --> 00:53:13,799
not to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah have not ran into</font>

1153
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:15,569
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> eats oh yes hunting down something</font>

1154
00:53:13,799 --> 00:53:18,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it started from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> boss's computer</font>

1155
00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:20,400
again we're dealing environments like

1156
00:53:18,509 --> 00:53:23,640
even the sea levels are fairly technical

1157
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,349
so but that's why we would love come out

1158
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:27,299
people out are you said to scratch that

1159
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:32,120
is but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know people have ran into that</font>

1160
00:53:27,299 --> 00:53:34,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">i've had a SISO open up fishing link</font>

1161
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:38,990
yeah there's yeah we have all had it and

1162
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:41,180
yeah probably wrap up take like two more

1163
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:43,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well I'll just say that</font>

1164
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:47,629
getting the suspicious stuff like we've

1165
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:50,029
seen like help desk software program

1166
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:52,370
whatever server like run<font color="#E5E5E5"> system 32</font>

1167
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:55,430
commands like legitimately like IP

1168
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:58,100
config and Who am I so you know just did

1169
00:53:55,430 --> 00:54:12,410
they find this stuff figured out that

1170
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:14,990
was kind of a tangent but yeah yeah yeah

1171
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:17,330
so he he asked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> I are coming in after</font>

1172
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:19,009
the fact people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

1173
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:21,170
stuff enabled even though windows will

1174
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:28,310
definitely have a few things enabled by

1175
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:30,530
default yeah yeah yeahs Windows Event

1176
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:32,480
Viewer is nice if it's like your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

1177
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:35,330
computer but get into a couple hundred

1178
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,910
Meg's so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> lastic search I know there</font>

1179
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:40,610
is actually a distro for elastic search

1180
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:43,970
using the sands class specific for

1181
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:46,790
forensics eventually and on after our

1182
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:49,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">next talk we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to release like</font>

1183
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:52,190
our google doc spreadsheet that we have

1184
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:54,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically tried to go through every</font>

1185
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:55,910
Windows Event log in every channel and

1186
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:58,190
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even close to scratching the</font>

1187
00:54:55,910 --> 00:55:00,410
surface<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the fourth time in every</font>

1188
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:02,900
channel for use cases the<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpdesk</font>

1189

system admin<font color="#CCCCCC"> host based on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> user auditing</font>

1190
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:10,370
and forensics was a big one and and and

1191
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:11,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's you know it's easy use of dynamic</font>

1192
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:13,759
field creation if you don't want to

1193
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:15,920
spend six six months writing a parser

1194
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,540
right is that I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely</font>

1195
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,720
recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm willing to</font>

1196
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:22,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">work with you if not you know I know</font>

1197
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,680
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> would do it even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for like hard</font>

1198
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:27,169
disk images from strings and stuff dump

1199
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:30,109
it in there notice yeah I know some

1200
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:32,660
folks that are doing that so if electric

1201
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:34,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">search use cases is basically limited to</font>

1202
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:38,259
your creativity anywhere from business

1203
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:45,549
and geospatial to security

1204
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:46,720
yep either we have you absolutely could

1205
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:48,880
do that whether you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> bringing the</font>

1206
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:51,279
server with you or just storing the

1207
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,710
server somewhere you know point<font color="#CCCCCC"> log</font>

1208
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">stash at the files</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want or you can</font>

1209
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:57,490
pipe it directly in the elastic search

1210
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:01,509
if you don't want to massage the data

1211
00:55:57,490 --> 00:56:05,589
you know so yeah I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take that</font>

1212
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:07,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last last question or give you guys</font>

1213
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:10,350
