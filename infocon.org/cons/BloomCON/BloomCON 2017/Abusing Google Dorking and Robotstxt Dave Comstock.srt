00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
search operators and we're not supposed

00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use essentially you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can find this I</font>

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,740
have a blog post blog blog<font color="#E5E5E5"> post based on</font>

its alan stanwyk ghost<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do but other</font>

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,469
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that let's have started we had some</font>

6
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,928
good times last night was here for dual

7
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:15,989
core anyone stay for dual core a couple

8
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:20,250
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay responsible afterwards right</font>

9
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:22,410
very responsible so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dorking what is it</font>

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,029
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do we use so back in the day</font>

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,060
there is a protocol called the web

12
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,099
exclusion protocol where it started out

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,779
saying that google had scrapers and

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,488
that's how google search engine work<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6n</font>

15
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,690
scraper<font color="#CCCCCC"> BOTS out and they gather the</font>

16
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:36,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">information of the website and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put it</font>

17
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,649
into their shirt database so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you</font>

18
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,239
could the way you're supposed to tell

19
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,489
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they weren't supposed to go</font>

20
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,839
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them to disallow them to go</font>

21
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:44,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">there what's the problem with this is</font>

22
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,010
that when you put it on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> web site</font>

23
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,079
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> website</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes my website calm /</font>

24
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,699
robot dot PHP that's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

25
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,160
there that's always that site that's the

26
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,320
robots.txt location so if you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

27
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,690
in their attackers all of a sudden know

28
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,149
where you don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to go on top</font>

29
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that they also have Google BOTS</font>

30
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:06,570
happen to index things they're not

31
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:10,320
supposed to index to begin with<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font>

32
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,309
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OWASP guide and this is</font>

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,439
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very first things they use</font>

34
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,540
and as you can see there there's a

35
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">couple of different search engines you</font>

36
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">can use you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can go through all of them</font>

37
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,130
show it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're probably familiar</font>

38
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,950
with that one by two you know all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

39
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,210
good stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> so here's a couple of the</font>

40
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,430
more common operators that are useful

41
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,710
quotations search for the exact phrase

42
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,540
sites restrict to the site file types

43
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,919
you can restrict a certain file types so

44
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,020
for instance you work<font color="#E5E5E5"> for cisco gear and</font>

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,150
they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the VPN Gringer typically</font>

46
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,890
in the PCF file you can type file type

47
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,329
PCF and then all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden you can</font>

48
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,990
find all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the publicly available</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco</font>

49
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,789
dumps all in your own URL in<font color="#CCCCCC"> url that</font>

50
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,850
restricts with you just in the URL<font color="#CCCCCC"> type</font>

51
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">operators and or things like that and</font>

52
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,048
then after<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do the search you can</font>

53
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,790
also do URL modifiers so once you get

54
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">the search you can copy and paste these</font>

55
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,829
in and so the first one the QDR limits

56
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,750
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> time frame and if you put in you know</font>

57
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:02,759
s per second<font color="#CCCCCC"> Denver minute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> H for our</font>

58
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,270
stuff like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will restrict it to just</font>

59
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:09,598
the past down and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tvm restricts</font>

60
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,209
it to just blogs apps images stuff like

61
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,619
that literal no auto correct that means

62
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,690
you will never get an auto correct

63
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,879
and then the disabled the personal

64
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,650
search the personalized<font color="#E5E5E5"> search lets you</font>

65
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,670
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a bubble urine so if</font>

66
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,780
you ever want to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get out of it</font>

67
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,548
and see what Google might show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

68
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,269
naturally just<font color="#E5E5E5"> paste that in at the</font>

69
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:29,819
order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your search so there's a couple</font>

70
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:32,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">of use cases and there was recently the</font>

71
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,589
yahoo hack was recently supposedly done

72
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:37,560
by a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Russian and one of the ways he did</font>

73
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:40,170
it was identifying web servers with

74
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get you can get</font>

75
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,819
foothold you can get generic admin login

76
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,900
pages you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all kinds of stuff</font>

77

credentials from that the credentials

79
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,220
might be reused somewhere else you can

80
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,250
do vulnerability search you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">pet certain files certain server types</font>

certain specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> versions of server</font>

83
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:58,769
types things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get</font>

84
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,349
verbose error messages so if there's a

85
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,760
log message that you know that has you

86
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:04,048
know just way too much information<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it</font>

87
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,608
you can search for that and find out

88
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:07,769
what people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are writing using it you can</font>

89
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:09,209
do it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a recon enumeration and then</font>

90
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:12,569
again you know you can find devices on

91
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:15,599
it in a similar way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show damn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too so</font>

92
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:18,599
this was a recent<font color="#E5E5E5"> airbus support they</font>

93
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,828
were an emergency 911 system and not

94
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,260
thing on twitter<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't follow and</font>

00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:24,000
follow me<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very smart guy but he</font>

96
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,130
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> said you know hey look look at</font>

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,109
this worm support site where all of a

98
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,970
sudden when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i change my user agent so I</font>

99
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:33,060
tell google that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm no longer me</font>

100
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:38,129
I'm a bot all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can get</font>

101
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:41,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">their login portal so the first part</font>

102
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:44,429
footholds and pivots you can find file

103
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,919
uploads you can do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> your url</font>

104
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">mutations for it too so let's say these</font>

105
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,569
two images here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had were a file upload</font>

106
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,760
service that are based on similar tale

107
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:56,010
um you know underlying frameworks and

108
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,269
all that so I took you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> X you too</font>

109
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:01,440
and that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in the the URL and I</font>

110
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:03,329
thought well maybe they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a</font>

111
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,340
version number so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried xq three</font>

112
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:06,540
actually one things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to try and</font>

113
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,349
see if you know they were older and

114
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:13,739
newer versions of the same thing so

115
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:16,260
vulnerabilities again servers files logs

116
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,760
software login admin portal you can find

117
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,530
crazy amounts of stuff with this

118
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,150
passwords database backup files uploaded

119
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,130
files site scrapes credentials files

120
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,849
again you can find crazy amounts of

121
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,219
stuff with

122
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,710
and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best things to do with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

123
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">is automate it as much as possible and</font>

124
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,710
there's two cool tools for there's a

125
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,210
bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them out there but snitch is a</font>

126
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,710
cool one and then what I really like

127
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,770
there's a new one by a guy named vector

128
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:43,109
and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's called a like dork net</font>

129
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:46,020
and I like it because it allows you not

130
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:48,180
way to use proxies it uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> silentium the</font>

131
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,640
bypass<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google patches and then on top of</font>

132
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,920
that it allows you to import custom list

133
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,020
most of them have like pre-built lists

134
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,610
they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh enter this into it and you</font>

135
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">know you'll start searching you don't</font>

136
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,520
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to look for the vulnerable files</font>

137
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:15,120
one will do that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one lets you</font>

138
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:17,130
import your route so<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so here we</font>

139
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,540
are and now i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you guys</font>

140
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,610
how to change user agents there's two

141
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,460
ways you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it you can download a</font>

142
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,380
plugin for chrome called using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nand</font>

143
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,239
changer and you can literally go through

144
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,100
and tell it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's useful developer tool</font>

145
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,380
if you can see oh well what is my

146
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,170
website look like on all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these different</font>

147
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,510
devices and then if you go down you can

148
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,830
start telling it the year<font color="#E5E5E5"> bot now if you</font>

149
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,900
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it the manual way because you</font>

150
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,359
don't want to rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tool you can</font>

151
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,669
bring up the developer tools in chrome

152
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,830
here go to network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then network</font>

153
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">conditions and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> usually</font>

154
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,849
checked select the user agent

155
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:53,610
automatically if you uncheck it all of a

156
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,140
sudden you can change it again<font color="#E5E5E5"> now keep</font>

157
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,970
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that when you do it you</font>

158
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,380
have to reload the<font color="#E5E5E5"> page every time so</font>

159
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,640
every time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it will only work once</font>

160
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:04,080
then you have to reload<font color="#CCCCCC"> the page</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

161
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:06,510
then go go away but other than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

162
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,909
here the robots.txt for wall street

163
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,890
journal com and as you can see here is

164
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,320
all the disallowed parts they don't want

165
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,820
to go into there's you know some of the

166
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,960
stuff to sitemap stuff we're allowed to

167
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:20,430
go to and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try going to</font>

168
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,960
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them that we're not supposed to</font>

169
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:31,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">go to so all the</font>

170
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:33,250
as you can see this is a part of their

171
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,710
site that you weren't supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

172
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,479
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to but yet we're still</font>

173
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,090
getting there without much of a problem

174
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,400
just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we knew where to look and</font>

175
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:45,758
again you can do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> admins will leave</font>

176
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,130
admin pages like login screens all<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

177
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">of crazy stuff of it it's so easy to</font>

178
00:06:48,130 --> 00:07:01,840
find it sometimes it's almost setting

179
00:06:49,660 --> 00:07:03,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so let's start doing some</font>

180
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,500
because this presentation is going to be

181
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,359
half just kind of blowing through giving

182
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:15,430
you the basic information and the rest

183
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:17,949
actually showing you how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it so</font>

184
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,780
this dork right here it takes the quotes

185
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:21,190
and it puts a PhD<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mahler prove</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

186
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,650
mailer and then it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the extension</font>

187
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,900
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> put your PT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attention so all of a</font>

188
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,719
sudden you can find publicly available

189
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:31,060
versions of the phpmailer that you might

190
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">be able to use and abuse they might have</font>

191
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:38,080
default credentials you know stuff like

192
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:39,340
that and again for generic footholds you

193
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,199
know first place so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can start</font>

194
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,539
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into you can try uploading files</font>

195
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to their site that well maybe shouldn't</font>

196
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:48,610
be there so all of a sudden we start

197
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:54,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">going through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and we start going to</font>

198
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:59,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">Gingka or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we got PHP airs it</font>

199
00:07:54,370 --> 00:08:01,210
sells so we got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hawaiian 60s let's see</font>

200
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:04,630
what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> over here in this one oh</font>

201
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:07,448
hey there's actually two oh yeah so now

202
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:11,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just found a file upload page I can</font>

203
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:14,500
just upload file to their site yeah but

204
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,500
that sounds cool right guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

205
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:20,190
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> this another one that searches for</font>

206
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,190
a file upload

207
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:32,360
we're just reversing their directories

208
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,650
let's see where we can go now we can

209
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">just I mean you can just do so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

210
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:41,689
recon with this it's it's ridiculous so

211
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:47,480
this X you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the example</font>

212
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:51,350
that brought up earlier and it brings us

213
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,240
to this which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

214
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,100
found with that generic file upload one

215
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,230
but then we notice down here it mentions

216
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,760
that extra upload v2 and this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

217
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,410
was talking about when I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

218
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,060
I'll try looking at different version

219
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,949
numbers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> new Meridian because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

220
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,650
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the URL there it says</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X you two</font>

221
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,600
extra upload<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so maybe there's a first</font>

222
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:10,490
version make it Xu one maybe there's an

223
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,930
extra three you know try doing that you

224
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,070
can not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only you know take these door</font>

225
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,650
from these are all publicly available

226
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:17,090
you can go to exploit DB for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google</font>

227
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">door from database and these are all</font>

228
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">just publicly available so you can</font>

229
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:24,949
create your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own out of one's others have</font>

230
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,209
already created for you and then again

231
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,850
there's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just some of the other</font>

232
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:31,610
one actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1x you three things like</font>

233
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:34,040
that and then you can also just trying

234
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,990
going back directories so maybe that

235
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,089
dork was just too exclusive maybe it

236
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,710
excluded some search results all of a

237
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:43,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">sudden we go we go back just you know</font>

238
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:45,410
one little directory there and we're

239
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,930
finding you know slightly<font color="#E5E5E5"> more getting</font>

240
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,459
some in different languages you know

241
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:53,780
there's only three on that first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

242
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:57,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so now finding vulnerabilities</font>

243
00:09:53,780 --> 00:10:02,360
this one is a PHP author of

244
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:08,329
authentication bypass dork so the second

245
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:13,730
you type it into Google<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> robot</font>

246
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:22,100
believe me see how good of a robot I not

247
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:35,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">am geez Google there you go</font>

248
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:37,670
no I am a robot after all so there's an

249
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,869
admin panel for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very personal type</font>

250
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,819
that comes up the peach babe in town

251
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,440
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that and again it searches for</font>

252
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:44,389
one that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a specific known</font>

253
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,100
vulnerability so you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

254
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:47,930
recent see bees that are dropping go and

255
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,019
look it you know vulnerabilities from

256
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:53,569
last year five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and if you know</font>

257
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:55,399
what specific one you're looking for you

258
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,630
can just and find all the publicly

259
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:58,250
available ones and if you're using it on

260
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,899
an actual engagement<font color="#E5E5E5"> like with what</font>

261
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,750
certain client you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use a site</font>

262
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:04,490
operator and then you can say it do it

263
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,720
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it only a text their site so</font>

264
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,800
you're not searching the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

265
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,579
anymore you're just doing their

266
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,990
particular website so this one again

267
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:15,290
talking about looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> very specific</font>

268
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:17,660
versions by using the in-text modifier

269
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,860
there you can look for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the version</font>

270
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,259
number seven point three two and that

271
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:28,670
again has a specifically known

272
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:31,040
vulnerability vulnerable files so this

273
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:33,139
one here will look for publicly

274
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,349
available fire files later shared on

275
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:39,290
onedrive so if you happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know that</font>

276
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">so what the client you're using uses</font>

277
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft products they use onedrive for</font>

278
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,449
you know uploading their files you can

279
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,680
start searching<font color="#E5E5E5"> and going through people</font>

280
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:47,660
and see who shared something by

281
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,250

administrative access to the network

290
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:28,209
that was hard right now this one is

291
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:30,040
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look for recently there was a</font>

292
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:32,410
lot of MongoDB instances that were being

293
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,120
right white because they had default

294
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,410
credentials you know they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> left open</font>

295
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,209
on the internet stuff like that this

296
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:41,589
will specifically look for those types

297
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:43,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">of servers and there's still more than</font>

298
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:46,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 pages of search results of them still</font>

299
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:51,879
publicly available even<font color="#CCCCCC"> after how many</font>

300
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:53,769
of them got home still there this one

301
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:55,269
this one's a really cool one if you pay

302
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:56,949
attention when you're using you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:59,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of website that you you know you</font>

304
00:12:56,949 --> 00:13:03,758
frequent often you can just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

305
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:06,219
well take the way the URL looks and then

306
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,139
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one will look for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wordpress backup</font>

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:12,490
file that often contain the passwords

308
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:13,899
the users credentials in them and here's

309
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,149
a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> wordpress sites where we can</font>

310
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:21,579
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> find our credentials like that</font>

311
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:25,480
now this one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really cool this looks</font>

312
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:31,359
for specific versions of openssl that

313
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:34,899
are vulnerable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack and this attack</font>

314
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:41,410
again known for a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time now and</font>

315
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:50,529
there's MIT showing up really<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font>

316
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:53,679
you know so one more try out move on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

317
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:55,420
passwords so and this is really one of

318
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:58,209
the when you're doing the custom tools

319
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,670
the scrapers the automated part of it

320
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:02,709
this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cool ones because you</font>

321
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,839
can start using it and search password

322
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:06,369
dumps and you can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking okay</font>

323
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,079
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I should just scrape these</font>

324
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,429
collects them collate them and say well

325
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,839
okay what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are people's most common</font>

326
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:12,579
passwords that are you so i can increase

327
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,649
my hash cat so that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have better</font>

328
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:16,089
rainbow tables stuff like that that way

329
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:19,120
you can find you know the most common

330
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:21,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">passwords and again this is looking for</font>

331
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,139
anything that has gmail com and password

332
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:24,850

available passwords so it has anything

339
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:54,489

straightforward again you can literally

365
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:21,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">just go to exploit exploit DB com use</font>

366
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:23,139
these publicly available ones find them

367
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:24,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">and use them against anyone companies</font>

368
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:26,079
you know use them for scraping for you

369
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:28,389
know data gathering you know whatever

370
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:33,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want so get to Dorking you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dorks</font>

what are you waiting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> red yeah</font>

372
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:41,020
the capacitance yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah and that's</font>

373
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,250
actually um I was having a problem

374
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,900
installing one of the tools one of the

375
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,130
modules because i had a demo that i was

376
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,110
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with one of the newer tools</font>

377
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,970
that came out but one way you can get

378
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,830
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is that tool users selenium</font>

379
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,450
and it uses web gecko so it kind of

380
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:54,880
makes its way around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can also</font>

381
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:56,470
you know if you input a proxy list stuff

382
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:03,939
like that you know you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get start</font>

383
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:06,730
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> by it through that yep that's</font>

384
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:08,980
unfortunately just going on the history

385
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:11,920
of the product itself and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really I</font>

386
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:15,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean what can you do to stop it the</font>

387
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:17,350
protocol still exists I mean it's the

388
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,700
only way that Google spiders work I mean

389
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:22,000
they would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

390
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,440
their entire operation probably i mean

391
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,930
that's just it's just not going to

392
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:32,710
happen it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunate but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

393
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:34,330
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to do anyone else all</font>

394
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">right well thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for coming guys i hope</font>
