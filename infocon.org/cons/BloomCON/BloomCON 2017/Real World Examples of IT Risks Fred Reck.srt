00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,210
because i worked with IBM so when I got

<font color="#E5E5E5">out of college I working with IBM what</font>

they call their systems integration

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,430
decision and one of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

46
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,530
saw they were sending<font color="#CCCCCC"> us out to very</font>

the things I started to<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice is that</font>

50
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,690
they were really<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused on the very</font>

51
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,640
large businesses but there was nobody

work so to a series of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

55
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:22,019
opportunities<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able to actually</font>

56
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,750
start my own systems integration

57
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:28,500
division which is it now turns into

58
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">Innotech one of the things that I want</font>

59
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do to make sure I make clear here is</font>

business perspective I had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

62
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,510
opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> last night to have dinner</font>

65
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,619
I was blown away by the technical detail

66
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:47,640
and then basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> Housemartins buddy is</font>

67
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,859
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this department and that's that's not</font>

68
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">my expertise they talk about Red Team</font>

69
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:56,069
Blue team and hashes and chain kill

70
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,530
chains in the attack and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that's</font>

71
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:01,409
that we deal with that stuff but but my

72
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,909
technicians you handle that my engineers

73
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:05,129
handle that and the vendors that we

74
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:06,450
partner with you handle that so a lot of

75
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:11,340
of you bringing is from a business

76
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:13,500
perspective so one of the things is you

77
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,000
know what do we do our<font color="#E5E5E5"> mission is to</font>

78
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that it businesses run more</font>

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,569
efficient efficiently effectively

80
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:21,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">improperly by leveraging their</font>

81
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:24,238
technology so when we work with a with a

82
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:26,430
business we'll put ourself in either as

83
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,280
the IT department or will support their

84
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,810
IT department with expertise we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

85
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,090
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like level one help desk support</font>

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,940
on up two major projects major

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,519
infrastructure upgrade a major portion

88
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,190
what do is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide the security</font>

89
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,199
services for them we manager security

patch management intrusion detection

91
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:49,919
from with DNS security things like that

92
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:51,930
to make sure that they stay secure we

93
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,810
also do backups and<font color="#CCCCCC"> things like that</font>

94
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,579
some of the different types of services

95
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,419
we do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this just some stats of what</font>

96
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:02,669
we're seeing with our tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> just another</font>

97
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,810
gold background both here in<font color="#CCCCCC"> bloomsburg</font>

98
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:09,000
and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> hazleton we have a network</font>

99
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:12,239
operations center and we have similar

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,069
resources at each location so that if

101
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,260
something happens to<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of our offices</font>

102
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:18,570
we can still provide the services to our

103
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,750
clients from the other from the other

104
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,909
location and so at our network

105
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,380
operations center we're tracking all the

106
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:25,980
systems that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage and all the</font>

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,600
servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

108
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">managed and all the security incidents</font>

109
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,530
that are on there and health statistics

110
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,210
on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and so we're getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

111
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,669
lot of data through our NOC and we're

112
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:38,580
able to kind of see what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on out</font>

113
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,140
there depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I can give you</font>

114
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">some examples of things that we've seen</font>

115
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,919
over the years but and I do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

116
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,750
specifically that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover but</font>

117
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,670
there's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> some examples right here so</font>

118
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,770
one of the services we provided email

119

protection blocking spam for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> client</font>

120
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,820
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see that on average fifty eight</font>

121
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,710
percent of all emails that come in or

122
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,170
some kind of spam or malware attached to

123
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:01,380
them we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some clients</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that have</font>

124
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:03,240
locations in other countries that we

125
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,820
also protect that and when we start

126
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,550
seeing that outside of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the United States</font>

127
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:12,330
we see the attack much much higher so up

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:15,390
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 81 percent of email can be can be</font>

360,000 attacks on all the networks that

136
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,830
do about a thousand backups every day of

137
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:38,040
Our client servers and backups and data

138

through and their networks taken down

that we can get them up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and back up and</font>

running quickly one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

142
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:50,880
that as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned a minute ago so</font>

143
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:53,039
where our services stop is basically

144
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,570
from the initial incident response so

145
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,100
when there's a problem you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

146
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,900
come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll take care of it will</font>

147
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,430
repair it and get the client up and

148
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,200
running again but when they would need

149
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,700
to start doing the forensic analysis we

150
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,140
have to call in other client other

151
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies other vendors that we work</font>

152
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:09,090
with that employ a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people you</font>

153
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">know like yourself that can actually dig</font>

154
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:14,940
deep sea with how the attack came in

155
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,680
what what that virus or malware was

156
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:21,240
going to do on their network things like

157
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,580
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's kind of scope scope of</font>

158
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,510
what we do but today as far as what

159
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,099
we're going to what we're going to cover

160
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,810
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit about the</font>

161
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,940
security threats for businesses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

162
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:32,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">damage that that's being caused out</font>

163
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,860
there I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about number one</font>

164
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,510
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat that all the protections</font>

165
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,400
that I just told you about we can't stop

166
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,960
it go into that a little bit more

167
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,770
details

168
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,239
another huge one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not exactly so</font>

169
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:47,299
notice what they cover in your classes

170
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,370
and things like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of them a</font>

171
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,930
huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing or how's fishing and social</font>

172
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:53,930
engineering and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook and how that's</font>

173
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,460
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into a business and reach</font>

174
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:59,690
them and basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> steal money from</font>

175
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:01,008
<font color="#CCCCCC">those businesses and then talk a little</font>

176
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,969
bit about the opportunities that this

177
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:06,680
present to people with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your expertise in</font>

178
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:12,199
the forensics and security professional

179
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:13,340
field briefly I wanted to kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of talk a</font>

180
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,130
little bit about the history of

181
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,799
cybercrime before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go into some of the</font>

182
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:21,620
specifics but um you know basically

183
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">cybercrime is becoming becoming very</font>

184
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:28,430
very prominent more prominent and it is

185
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:30,138
the main type of crime in fact 2016

186
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:33,650
there was more money stolen

187
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:36,349
electronically than physically in the

188
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:38,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">world is there 2016 or 2015 that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font>

189
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:43,729
major milestone that would that was in

190
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:45,020
the world that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had come about but</font>

191
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:48,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically I was talking a little about</font>

192
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,359
the evolution of crime so you know back

193
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:52,370
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the old days if somebody wanted to</font>

194
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,139
steal money from somebody they might

195
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,080
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hide out behind a dumpster with a</font>

196
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:59,270
pocket knife right and jump out and tell

197
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">the person I'm gonna stick you up you</font>

198
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,049
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me all your money and so</font>

199
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,989
theoretically that<font color="#E5E5E5"> person would hand</font>

200
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,729
over their wallet and they do you know

201
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,520
that criminal go home with a small

202
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:12,560
payday so as the criminals became more

203
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,590
sophisticated and<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology started</font>

204
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,419
started coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> into play the the</font>

205
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:21,739
criminals would use technology to

206
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:23,900
leverage their skill sets right so now

207
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,240
we've now<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast-forward to the cowboy</font>

208
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,159
days and when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the trains that</font>

209
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,840
are going across the United States they

210
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,069
realize that they could stop a train

211
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,659
hijack a train hop in there and now they

212
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:38,209
can stop the train<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk through and they</font>

213
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:40,099
can stick everybody up and now when they

214
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:43,609
leave they just held up 300 people and

215
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:45,290
their payday is even bigger you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know so</font>

216
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,209
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we fast forward into you know to</font>

217
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,810
today where everybody's connected

218
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:52,579
electronically right now you can stick

219
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,010
up 80 million people

220
00:08:52,580 --> 00:09:01,010
from the comfort of your own home right

221
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:02,960
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure you guys you are exposed to</font>

222
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,270
the news and the date big data breaches

223
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,070
things like that but you know nobody's

224
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,930
immune from this stuff and JPMorgan

225
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,270
Chase this is a couple years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago now but</font>

226
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:14,329
you know 80 million households and<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven</font>

227
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:16,970
million businesses were hacked a account

228
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:19,760
information was stolen credit card

229
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,830
information is stolen again years ago

230
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,110
there was a target at Home Depot attack

231
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,880
all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are happening from</font>

232
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:28,490
relatively small groups of individuals

233
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,220
typically in other countries and they're

234
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:34,220
able to hack into electronic Network and

235
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,680
and steal information personal data and

236
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:40,850
all that and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is definitely a</font>

237
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:44,599
money-making opportunity for the right

238
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,680
minded individual and and the reason

239
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's becoming more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and more</font>

240
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,380
prevalent and so so I'd probably say

241
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,050
about 15 years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> it may be a little</font>

242
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,700
more we started to see it went from a

243
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,560
virus that would just do something

244
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,870
malicious to your computer shut it down

245
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:04,099
maybe advertise the hackers main thing

246
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:05,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now money literally being taken out</font>

247
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">of bank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accounts and problems like that</font>

248
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the reason is is that the criminals</font>

249
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:14,120
have discovered how they can actually

250
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,560
monetize the data once they figure out

251
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">how they can monetize this data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and what</font>

252
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,010
that means they take if they can take

253
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">control your systems or take control</font>

254
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,550
your data and they can figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a way</font>

255
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,700
to turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> that into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cash now the</font>

256
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:27,170
motivations<font color="#E5E5E5"> there right so just to suck</font>

257
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,730
some of the some of the statistics of

258
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,199
what this stuff is worth you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a</font>

259
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:33,140
credit card can be worth anywhere from

260
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,270
two ninety dollars a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook account</font>

261
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,490
this I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> updated this information</font>

262
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,840
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just this week facebook</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> account you</font>

263
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,550
get paid three dollars you can hack a

264
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,890
facebook account and sell that on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

265
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,150
black market so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to give you a</font>

266
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,740
stat a little bit later to show you how

267
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">much money that actually translates it</font>

268
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,370
into by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I don't mean to give you</font>

269
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys hear from any ideas on how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

270
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:54,350
money here right it's the wrong area

271
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:57,770
that I'm realizing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm probably a</font>

272
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:59,840
advertising the wrong side of the wall

273
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,730
here but what point is i'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> showing</font>

274
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,480
where the opportunity lies to protect

275
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,480
from these types of things

276
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:11,220
they make fake ATM card clubs there's

277
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:14,610
all kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do to turn</font>

278
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:17,160
this information into<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the money and</font>

279
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,720
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys probably know better than</font>

280
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,689
me Eve and that anybody can buy the

281
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,640
tools right on online to build these

282
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,980
kids to build these viruses to go on

283
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,530
site to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into these networks and</font>

284
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,200
compromise them so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a hard</font>

285
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:32,280
business to get into so again what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

286
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,650
we going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect them what are we</font>

287
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:39,810
actually seeing how this happened so

288
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:42,420
brand new malware threats every day this

289

<font color="#E5E5E5">is recent information from from a larger</font>

290
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,819
this year 125,000 new malware threats

291
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,250
are being<font color="#CCCCCC"> released every day that's</font>

292
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,660
brand new<font color="#E5E5E5"> never before seen just a</font>

293
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,820
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> side note on that is that</font>

294
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">traditionally we used to protect things</font>

295
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:59,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">with with the virus based definitions or</font>

296
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:03,150
definition based protection where we

297
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,410
know if the virus looks like we make

298
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure all the computers are looking for</font>

299
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:09,030
that particular virus and then we can

300
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,980
stop the stop the attacks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way well</font>

301
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:14,339
because so much new stuffs coming out

302
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero-day viruses and things like that we</font>

303
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:19,440
have to come up with new<font color="#E5E5E5"> technologies to</font>

304
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:23,430
be able to stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> how these how these</font>

305
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,190
attacks are happening so I said 145 new

306
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:29,430
malware threats but in in total over

307
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:31,260
half a million a day of threats are

308
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:34,229
being released<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you guys can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

309
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:36,120
these charts here so you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention</font>

310
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:39,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">about 15 years ago so I mean it was more</font>

311
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,340
like 10 years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks like so 2007</font>

312
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,500
this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes up I don't fear from</font>

313
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,270
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> a logarithmic curve but you can</font>

314
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,180
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is doubling about every</font>

315
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:52,140
year on there and it doesn't show any

316
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:53,760
sign of slowing down so like I said

317
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,800
there's a lot of opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop</font>

318
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,920
these things a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of opportunity in</font>

319
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:03,689
your field for how you can be a part of

320
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:05,219
stopping this in protecting business but

321
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,140
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple virus</font>

322
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,280
protection or firewalls aren't enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

323
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:12,420
stop these these types of attacks

324
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:15,569
anymore<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like having us stop a tank</font>

325
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:17,339
with a squirt gun or something so now a

326
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,240
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times when I'm out consulting</font>

327
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,520
with different businesses

328
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,230
you know they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey you know we see</font>

329
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,240
the news all these big firms are at risk

330
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,310
you know I'm a small business I've only

331
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,680
got 50 people here no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> really wants</font>

332
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:30,149
wants to attack my network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the fact</font>

333
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,579
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the matter the absolute fact is</font>

334
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:37,170
that's one hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent wrong one in</font>

335
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:39,240
five small businesses is attacked each

336
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:42,420
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that number just keeps on keeps</font>

337
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,399
on growing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason that is is that</font>

338
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,860
the small businesses don't have the

339
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,610
money and the resources to put in place

340
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">to protect their networks at dinner in</font>

internal team that that every time

345
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,899
there's a security incident his team

dispatched within the organization to

347
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,500
find out what's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then they</font>

348
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,270
do remediation and figure out what

349
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,760
processes they can put in place to<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop</font>

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continually improve well you know</font>

351
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,410

businesses can you know and that's what

355
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:25,199
a company like mine would come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

356
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,399
help them in that regard but anyways

their customers or service that their

comes in from a business perspective

394
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:56,370
that is crucial if there's a couple day

interruption we're a business can't

396

bring cash into their organization that

397
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,439
can shut a business down it can put them

398

right out of business and so a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

or you make ruining their whole year

<font color="#CCCCCC">just for a couple days being down so</font>

405
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:26,969
that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge risk that small</font>

business had all right one of the things

<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to want to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about is</font>

408
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:34,379
this concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of knowledge-based</font>

409
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:36,209
authentication again i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

410
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:37,680
familiar with what you guys learn on a

what knowledge-based authentication is

413
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:45,269
so you know you guys have a password

414
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:48,719
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many times there's a password</font>

415
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:51,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">and account are protected via a password</font>

416
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,790
well that's great because<font color="#E5E5E5"> only you</font>

417
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:56,939
presumably know about that that password

418
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,920
there but if you lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> your password and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">thus are kind of talking generically</font>

420
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,449
here what typically has to happen when

421

<font color="#E5E5E5">you lose a password</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get your password</font>

what cities to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> high school now who</font>

432
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,860
here can figure out where one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

433
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,059
friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to high school</font>

434
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:41,639
right that's about one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the easiest</font>

435
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:43,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing to do these days that's that's</font>

436
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,940
that's the concept of knowledge-based

437
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:48,840
authentication and

438
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,490
so now in the world today all this

439
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,110
information we're all putting our

440
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:54,420
personal information<font color="#CCCCCC"> out online whether</font>

441
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,830
we want to or we that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't and so</font>

442
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,600
this personal information is out there

443
00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:02,790
so this knowledge-based authentication

444
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:09,689
is quickly becoming a liability now and

445
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:11,490
and a great example of that who hears

446
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:13,320
heard of the office of personal man of

447
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:17,340
management personnel management data

448
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:19,320
breach you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> seriously have it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

449
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">being tired today or you guys don't know</font>

450
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:25,800
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's a major deal that's a</font>

451
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:28,080
huge deal so in 2015 21 and a half

452
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:31,800
million records were stolen from the US

453
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,270
government they suspect<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was a Chinese</font>

454
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't know if that's true or not but</font>

455
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:38,700
that's that's what Wall Street Journal

456
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:41,460
of put out there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody in the</font>

470
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,350
putting in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the database</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere do</font>

471
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:15,390
they put all this so all the military

472
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:17,760
personnel anybody with secret secret

473
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:19,890
clearance top secret<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearance they've</font>

474
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,940
got all this data in a database

475
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:26,700
somewhere and when you know it one of

476
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:30,840
our major I don't want call them enemies

477
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:33,090
but major other country hacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> and steals</font>

478
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,350
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that information now we put that</font>

479
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">into perspective of knowledge-based</font>

480
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:39,030
authentication that is a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

481
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,550
now all these people's information is

482
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:43,200
out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this information you can't</font>

483
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,419
change you know you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> change your</font>

484
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:50,790

485
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:52,470
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happened in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the past so so</font>

486
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:55,860
that's that's a big deal right there um

487
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mentioned about how can you find you</font>

488
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,379
know where your friends went to high

489
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:02,100
school something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

490
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:10,020
social media social media is a huge

491
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:12,780
security rig so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys you post</font>

492
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,889
things online I'm sure everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows</font>

493
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,360
that you know once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> post something</font>

494
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,240
online it's there forever right and

495
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:23,490
that's that's relatively true but

496
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:25,500
Facebook for instance the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1.2 million</font>

497
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:28,530
Facebook accounts are hacked every

498
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:33,540
single day and that's also i looked at

499
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:35,940
number up for this presentation you know

500
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">i give security presentations regularly</font>

501
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,930
but that's another number that has been

502
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,610
doubling every year<font color="#E5E5E5"> i showed you that</font>

503
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:44,730
logarithmic curve with a malware attacks

504
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:47,399
the breaches that are happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 2014</font>

505
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:52,710
when i first<font color="#CCCCCC"> started using this slide</font>

506
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:54,180
that number was 160,000 actually was to

507
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:57,240
that end of two thousand that was data

508
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:59,730
from 2013 then it went up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 300,000</font>

509
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:03,690
then it went to 600,000 last year in

510
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:06,540
2015 over 600,000 and today it's 1.2

511
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:08,700
million packs a day that's doubling

512
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,500
every single day these accounts are

513
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:15,510
being hacked and now they have all that

514
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:22,800
personal information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you so social</font>

515
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:24,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">media is a huge risk and and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

516
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,740
another just drive this point home that

517
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,120
the data is out there I'll kind of go

518
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,450
through this quick but there are

519
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,129
services out there that from a marketing

520
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,420
perspective if I wonder if I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

521
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,370
business of<font color="#CCCCCC"> selling something let's say</font>

522
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,290
I was selling automobiles and I was

523
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:40,590
selling high-end out of automobiles and

524
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:44,310
I knew that my target customer had

525
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:45,600
certain attributes about them there's

526
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,970
data this is this is coming right<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

527
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,919
is called axiom you can go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

528
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:52,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">can pull some information in here this</font>

529
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the data</font>

530
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:57,120
that they have on actual people you can

531
00:21:54,300 --> 00:22:00,000
say hey I want somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who cares about</font>

532
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:04,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">the environment I want to know if</font>

533
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,890
they've written any politician recently

534
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,150
these are actual criteria you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can put in</font>

535
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,640
there and then boom they give you a list

536
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:14,940
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these people I think</font>

537
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,500
Taylor your marketing information either

538
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:20,880
your marketing information or your

539

social<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering phishing scam towards</font>

540
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,890
that person specifically and so I

541
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:29,310
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the number one a risk</font>

542
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:32,340
that we have out there that I could you

543
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:35,550
know antivirus email protection

544
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:38,520
firewalls<font color="#E5E5E5"> intrusion detection all this</font>

545
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:43,889
stuff we can't stop a two-man error

546
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:45,420
right and so that that's the number one

547
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:50,760
compromise that we see in our networks

548
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:52,620
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides probably out of out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of order</font>

549
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,950
here but I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the facebook of</font>

the network and it goes out and it

573
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,780
encrypts through encryption technology

locks all the files again I expect you

575
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:06,960
guys are familiar for these encryption

576
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:09,810
encryption ciphers are now they're

577
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,040
unbreakable and so basically about

578
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,179
yourself your business you don't a

579
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,560
couple million dollars a year you got

580
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">all your data is really important and</font>

581
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,040
you need to have your orders coming in

582
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:19,950
now so you can pay your payroll pay your

583
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,480
bank loans hey your vendors all that you

584
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,890
keep going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you come in when they</font>

585
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,590
turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> your computer on you won't have any</font>

586
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:27,750
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff right now the</font>

587
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,189
you're sweating<font color="#E5E5E5"> bullets and you need to</font>

588
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:31,140
hire somebody to try to break this

589
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:34,020
reverse engineer this unbreakable code

590
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:36,120
or you can just pay the ransom and they

591
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:38,668
let you know and then no one lost your

592
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,739
files for you and so again that is a

593
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:44,460
huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the for the bad</font>

594
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,690
guys right<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple examples I promise I</font>

595
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:51,299
was going to give some examples of

596
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:53,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">real-world stuff that we've seen by the</font>

597
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:56,279
way I belong<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an organization of about</font>

598
00:24:53,669 --> 00:24:58,950
300 different IP service providers and

599
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:01,289
so we ought to meet four times a year

600
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:03,690
down in Nashville and we share war

601
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:05,158
stories so these haven't all been one

602
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,320
that we've seen directly but these are

603
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,149
like best friends of mine that had dealt

604
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,309
with this with some of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

605
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:14,520
is one that he had handled one was an

606
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:15,690
oil<font color="#E5E5E5"> company and I got my notes here I</font>

607
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought I just want make sure he knows</font>

608
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:21,210
right and basically they had connected

609
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:23,130
their domain controller everybody was

610
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:26,370
somewhat familiar concept the windows

611
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:28,350
networks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had their</font>

612
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:31,559
domain controller attach rate to the

613
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:34,168
Internet as a terminal server<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

614
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:36,000
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> already laughing right well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

615
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:39,419
administrator pass and username was

616
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">administrator's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was a password</font>

617
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:45,029
with such that a elementary school kid

618
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:49,110
could break the password<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font>

619
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:52,500
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were able to so there was</font>

620
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:55,709
a but<font color="#E5E5E5"> before they called my friend in</font>

621
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:58,380
they got their files encrypted and they

622
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,909
I think they had a backup<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were</font>

623
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,010
able to undo it but then a week later

624
00:25:59,909 --> 00:26:04,080
boom it happened again and they weren't

625
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:07,740
sure how this was coming in but

626
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,049
basically it turned out that they got

627
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,520
their files encrypted they didn't have a

628
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:15,840
backup that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could recover from it</font>

629
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:20,158
and so has anyone done with ransomware

630
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:22,500
okay so it started out it was like an

631
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,450
automated process hey you have 48 hours

632
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,950
to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> this many bitcoins and will</font>

633
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,860
unlock your files with all background

634
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,000
stuff is<font color="#E5E5E5"> automated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process well they</font>

635
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:33,389
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> a three thousand dollars in</font>

636
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,909
bitcoins<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's to pay that you say</font>

637
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:39,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay send three thousand dollars and</font>

638
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:41,399
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular sample file</font>

639
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:43,710
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll unlock your files for you and</font>

640
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:45,119
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they did they take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that sample file</font>

641
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:49,019
and they look at the type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that's</font>

642
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:50,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">in this file and when they saw what type</font>

643
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:51,690
of data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had encrypted all they</font>

644
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,429
knew that they were run in there and

645
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:55,499
they encrypted the<font color="#E5E5E5"> files but when they</font>

646
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:58,590
saw how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much data was there they emailed</font>

647
00:26:55,499 --> 00:27:00,539
back and they said you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what thanks</font>

648
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:02,309
for the three thousand dollars it's

649
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:06,749
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cost you twenty seven thousand</font>

650
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:08,850
dollars now to get your<font color="#E5E5E5"> data back and so</font>

651
00:27:06,749 --> 00:27:11,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically they negotiated back and forth</font>

652
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:13,980
and they were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get out of it for</font>

653
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:15,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">eleven thousand total but they had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

654
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,730
pay eleven thousand dollars over and

655
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:21,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">they was down for two and a half days to</font>

656
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:23,789
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that back that's just one example of</font>

657
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:27,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">a ransomware there another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one was an</font>

658
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:31,139
electrical<font color="#E5E5E5"> contractor and they had had a</font>

659
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:33,269
similar scenario where we checked<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

660
00:27:31,139 --> 00:27:35,008
event logs we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to see that they</font>

661
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:38,429
were being<font color="#E5E5E5"> brute force attack on their</font>

662
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:41,039
passwords that did and what had happened

663
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:43,080
is to an automated process and again you

664
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,149
guys might know more about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with</font>

665
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,799
the details of this and I would know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

666
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:48,299
through some automated process they were

667
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,639
brute force attacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> this trying to</font>

668
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:53,730
find the password a logged in for one

669
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:56,998
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then logged out and then five</font>

670
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:58,529
minutes later a person logged in because

671
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:59,639
we could see five minutes later someone

672
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:01,080
logged in they were in there for a

673
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:03,269
couple minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they deployed their</font>

674
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:07,918
software on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> network locked all the</font>

675
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:10,049
files<font color="#CCCCCC"> that client had a backup</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we</font>

676
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,720
were able to figure that out and get

677
00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:15,239
that get that remedy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's another</font>

678
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">example of the use automated tools</font>

679
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:19,799
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what the password is and then</font>

680
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:21,210
they you know pry<font color="#CCCCCC"> on their screen they</font>

681
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:23,039
said oh we got one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

682
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,739
automatically logged in and did their

683
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,600
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it so that's just an example of</font>

684
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:31,109
some ransomware types of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

685
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:35,158
see you see a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the news but that's</font>

686
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:38,220
it that's a very popular one another a

687
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:39,480
vector<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these come</font>

688
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,429
in I just told you about brute force

689
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,109
connection to the terminal server is to

690
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:45,779
spam and again this goes into that

691
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:49,289
social engineering thing so spam is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

692
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:51,220
number one vector of breaches that come

693
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:55,090
in they'll get an email someone clicked

694
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:57,520
the email<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it deploys but by the way</font>

695
00:28:55,090 --> 00:29:00,189
in case you guys don't know this but

696
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,960
you're getting spam and there's an

697
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:03,370
unsubscribe button on the bottom it's

698
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,049
typically a bad idea to click the

699
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:06,729
unsubscribe because all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really does</font>

700
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:08,620
is confirms to them that you're a real

701
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:10,059
person and now they know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

702
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:12,129
right email address for you and then

703
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:15,940
they end up selling your email so<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

704
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:17,289
other people says to send<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself but I</font>

705
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to talk a little bit about about</font>

706
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:21,850
fishing and spearfishing and this is all

707
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:24,908
done to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through spans</font>

708
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:28,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">so fishing is generally they'll send out</font>

709
00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:31,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">a email with an attachment to just</font>

710
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,799
people they don't know and it'll might

711
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,879
say something like hey your<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet</font>

712
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,549
here's your tracking number for your

713
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,990
package it's been delayed please click

714
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:41,440
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out your note your new work</font>

715
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:46,570
a date of delivery and so they're hoping

716
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:48,220
that you click on that and so that's his

717
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:51,730
general fishing that's just a blanket

718
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:53,980
type of email that they send out here's

719
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:59,110
an example of one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got that was</font>

720
00:29:53,980 --> 00:30:02,020
like that it was a flower place and it

721
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:04,240
was a couple days before<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of</font>

722
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:06,940
Valentine's Day they're like hey you

723
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,169
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> credit here and click here and of</font>

724
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,429
course I didn't click on it but it was

725
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:12,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">just an example I thought I'd put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it up</font>

726
00:30:09,429 --> 00:30:17,710
because I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen that directly but but</font>

727
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:19,600
one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is more dangerous is the spear</font>

728
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">fishing and called the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> president scam</font>

729
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,199
and this is where they use it social

730
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,120
engineering I told you about Facebook

731
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,059
and LinkedIn and all that all that data

732
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,649
is out there and so what they do is they

733
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:31,330
will research a company to have a

734
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:33,520
database of big companies they look for

735
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:35,710
a certain size company and then they go

736
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">on linkedin or any of these databases</font>

737
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:41,049
and they find out who the financial

738
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:42,549
officers in that company are and they

739
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:45,100
find out who the financial officers are

740
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:47,770
and then i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you this</font>

769
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:19,889
targeted this company they went out and

770

up an<font color="#CCCCCC"> email address and they basically</font>

772
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">made it look like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know they were</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">not send the money they didn't lose the</font>

776
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,760
money there was no real breach there was

777
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:38,940
no internal network breach to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

778
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:42,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen that was all done externally</font>

779
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:45,750
through social engineering we do see a

780
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:48,659
lot of these this ransom a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

781
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:50,340
ransomware our clients or people that

782
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:52,289
call us who aren't clients yet but

783
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:54,149
they've been breached will often see

784
00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:56,970
this time the finance people that are

785
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:59,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting these emails that end up</font>

786
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:01,440
deploying<font color="#E5E5E5"> the payload and then their</font>

787
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:03,418
computers want to start and the files

788
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,450
get encrypted first thing that the files

789
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:08,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the software does it looks for</font>

790
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:09,539
network shares and goes down to network

791
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,440
shares and walks them up because they

792
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:12,090
know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the valuable</font>

793
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,610
information is the stuff the whole

794
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:16,939
company uses they may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

795
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,939
about that

796
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:22,060
to basically how do businesses protect

797
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:24,160
themselves others<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it is real</font>

798
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:26,320
quick now I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of how I see</font>

799
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,850
the opportunities for for your ear field

800
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,800
but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a lot of security awareness</font>

801
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:34,330
training there's some tools there that

802
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:36,700
people can can use having a good

803
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:39,070
technology usage policy for the company

804
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,750
two-factor authentication you guys are

805
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:43,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">all snow two-factor authentication outro</font>

806
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:44,740
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to continue to be more</font>

807
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:46,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">and more popular every every password</font>

00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,830
people will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get credit monitoring on</font>

813
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,960
themselves i know i<font color="#CCCCCC"> have it on myself</font>

814
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:03,129
that way if people are open accounts

815
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:08,500
under your name you can see it right

816
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:13,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">away that's another thing there's just</font>

817
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:15,010

818
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,270
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to talk a little bit</font>

819
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:21,310
about the opportunities for the IT

820
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:23,710
security professional so as I said you

821
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:27,639
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we do and a lot of companies</font>

822
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:30,220
like myself we put the security systems

823
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:31,750
in place and I contract out a lot i use

824
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:34,029
different vendors different software

825
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:35,679
tools to protect the client network so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

826
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">learn about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how it does it from a</font>

827
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,040
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> process and we put those in</font>

828
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:41,170
place we make sure standards are in

829
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,850
place things like that but when there is

830
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:44,860
an incident and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> an incident</font>

831
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:47,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">response and there's a loss or even a</font>

832
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,880
potential lon we need to have

833
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:51,159
professionals come in place people that

834
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,960
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually go in see what code was was</font>

835
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:55,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">happening how it was deployed things</font>

836
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,750
like that so this incidence response is

837
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:01,030
going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and more popular at</font>

838
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:02,650
dinner last night I was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a</font>

839
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:04,990
conversation a lot of my clients and

840
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:06,940
here in central PA once we recover them

841
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:08,740
and we get them up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> running again</font>

842
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,030
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said their main concern is</font>

843
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,169
making sure they get their orders out

844
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,730
the door they can get their receivables

845
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:14,620
coming in the cash come into the

846
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:17,020
business once they get that they don't

847
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:19,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">really care because that's the small</font>

848
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:22,750
businesses that you know they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

reverse engineer these<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks and make</font>

sure they're specifically protected from

exponential curves<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i was showing</font>

00:35:49,339 --> 00:35:52,489
the market and smaller companies are

<font color="#E5E5E5">I believe that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an incidence response</font>

00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,960
the antivirus is updated<font color="#CCCCCC"> and pretty much</font>

real briefly where there's tits out

there you can build the fire you<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy the</font>

898
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:11,180
they even have payment networks that you

can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> in rent and so you can city so</font>

900
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,538
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zero-day viruses</font>

00:37:13,009 --> 00:37:18,769
are becoming more and more sophisticated

00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:22,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so what we're seeing from my</font>

00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:24,649
perspective in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the field is now</font>

904
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:27,380
we're the security solutions that are

905
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:30,319
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most effective are the ones that</font>

906
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:33,619
look at how the how these breaches are

907
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:35,660
happening what is the is the methodology

908
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:38,299
that they use or you know how these

909
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:41,868
viruses act in a certain way<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we've</font>

910
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:43,430
recently tested implemented it's been

911
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:44,480
two years now we put it across all our

912
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:47,060
client networks

913
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,830
now we have a tool that knows where all

914
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:50,750
the bad host computers are out on the

915
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:52,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet and so anytime any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

916
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,810
client computers tries to start

917
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:55,130
communicating to these host computers it

918
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:57,529
shuts it down<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't matter what type</font>

919
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,970
of communication that there is and so

920
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:00,200
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of an example where now</font>

921
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:03,589
we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> first looking for the specific</font>

922
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,118
virus now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for how the</font>

923
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,590
computers are communicating to the

924
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,380
network of bad computers that are known

925
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:12,410
out there and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> even on another layer</font>

926
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:15,260
to that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that now as a new computer</font>

927
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:17,960
maybe become a host computer that's

928
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:19,850
running this malicious code first thing

929
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,250
that they know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this this computer</font>

930
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:25,580
will come online and it will do a

931
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:27,590
certain number of procedures that all

932
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:29,660
these other ones have done and now so it

933
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:32,180
can actually I see a bad host computer

934
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:34,220
comes online it tags it as such and adds

935
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,810
to the list of blocked IP addresses that

936
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:38,689
these computers<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't connect to any</font>

937
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:41,690
more and so that's just one<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of</font>

938
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:43,730
the sophistication of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the protections</font>

939
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:45,680
growing like that and that's where I

940
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:48,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">think you know with artificial</font>

941
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:51,319
intelligence the growth in that you know

942
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:52,730
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have I don't even know</font>

943
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,350
what you have five years ten years from

944
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:56,180
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security landscapes going to</font>

945
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:58,910
look like but it's definitely

946
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:00,680
opportunities for people with skill<font color="#E5E5E5"> sets</font>

947
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:02,420
such as yourselves to get out there and

948
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,430
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on the right side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fence</font>

949
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:08,030
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that by the way all these all these</font>

950
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:09,919
criminal activities I've been describing

951
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:11,990
if you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull any of that in the</font>

952
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,460
inside inside the United States you'd be

953
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:16,220
shut down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and arrested and sent away for</font>

954
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:19,070
life so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be life but you'd</font>

955
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,660
be sent away for a long time most of it

956
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:23,090
comes from like Ukraine from the Asia

957
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:25,129
countries things like that where we

958
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:26,480
can't extradite we can't get in there

959
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">and extradite them because they can they</font>

960
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,880
know where the attacks are coming from

961
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,399
they know where the bad guys are coming

962
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,690
from but they can't the laws aren't

963
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,550
there to school<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mountain stop them</font>

964
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,420
that's why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stop it that's all</font>

965
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,859

00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:37,819
thing that's coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought it look</font>

990
00:40:33,949 --> 00:40:39,680
you guys do that's what I had prepared

991
00:40:37,819 --> 00:41:02,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">for today I'm happy to take questions</font>

992
00:40:39,680 --> 00:41:04,819
yes sir good yeah we have not

993
00:41:02,779 --> 00:41:06,469
implemented that particular method but

994
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:09,049
I've also seen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's probably</font>

995
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:10,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's going to happen I mentioned about</font>

996
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,900
that protection where they're looking

997
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the bad hosts on the internet that's</font>

998
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:17,569
protection of the DNS layer so we

999
00:41:14,569 --> 00:41:19,579
basically are taken over clients dns and

1000
00:41:17,569 --> 00:41:21,439
then we're and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

1001
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:23,359
probably going to evolve into what you

1002
00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:25,160
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said but essentially that</font>

1003
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:28,219
technology we're using is kind of like

1004
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:30,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's blacklisting these servers out out</font>

1005
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:32,029
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet but at some level I'm</font>

1006
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,309
pretty sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that white</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> list is going to</font>

1007
00:41:32,029 --> 00:41:38,479
come in we do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some clients that</font>

1008
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:41,029
they'll pick certain computer systems

1009
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:42,439
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just being all go</font>

1010
00:41:41,029 --> 00:41:44,420
on the internet and do whatever they

1011
00:41:42,439 --> 00:41:46,489
want today is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> front desk computer or</font>

1012
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:48,259
some very important you know like maybe

1013
00:41:46,489 --> 00:41:50,299
an accounting computer something like

1014
00:41:48,259 --> 00:41:53,869
that they don't you go anywhere so we

1015
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:57,109
will just only<font color="#E5E5E5"> case-by-case basis oh I'm</font>

1016
00:41:53,869 --> 00:41:58,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go to whitelisted site but</font>

1017
00:41:57,109 --> 00:42:02,109
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one case by case basis right</font>

1018
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:02,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">now yes sir</font>

1019
00:42:25,060 --> 00:43:16,360
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say no and I actually</font>

1020
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:19,150
as I was tweaking this presentation for

1021
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:22,150
you guys today a lot of times my

1022
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:23,920
audiences business owners right so I

1023
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:25,480
pull a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the stuff out but I told</font>

1024
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">that slide out that your dis described</font>

1025
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,100
right now it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to go online</font>

1026
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,800
you can have an advertisement up on

1027
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:37,060
Google on the thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people wept</font>

1028
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:40,870
on browsing you can have an ad up in 10

1029
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:44,140
minutes probably and so what happened is

1030
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:46,450
that these display ads will have either

1031
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:48,160
some kind of pixel technology or just

1032
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:51,069
quite frankly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the page that it goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1033
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:54,730
has an exploit kit loaded on it and so

1034
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:56,800
as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> criminal I can put the page on I</font>

1035
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:58,900
can I can create an advertisement and

1036
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,740
says hey today only a hundred dollar

1037
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:04,180
iPad click here and so everybody's like

1038
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,740
oh yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they click and they think of</font>

1039
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:08,020
it there's they might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a totally</font>

1040
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:09,279
legitimate<font color="#CCCCCC"> web page USA Today or Fox</font>

1041
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,590
News or whatever the heck they're

1042
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,980
reading and they get an ad here it says

1043
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:16,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">$100 ipad boom they click it so you know</font>

1044
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:19,360
they got they have they're downloading a

1045
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:20,560
virus so if it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> completely white</font>

1046
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:23,500
listed yet they wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to go</font>

1047
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,029
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that go to that site but but my point</font>

1048
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:29,110
is is that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really easy to use</font>

1049
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:32,310
display advertising to promote your

1050
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:32,310
viruses yes sir

1051
00:44:34,190 --> 00:45:06,650
yeah that's probably probably good a

1052
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:23,569
good strategy yeah what<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

1053
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:27,470
you guys have yes sir I don't see that

1054
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:29,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">growing and I'm not exactly sure if we</font>

1055
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:31,580
can you know how we would implement that

1056
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:36,140
because you know a lot of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> pages</font>

1057
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:37,819
you know the ad space is already on that

1058
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,950
page to work if we're able to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1059
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:43,550
page they're serving up from a third

1060
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:47,000
party what's in that same and i'm not

1061
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:48,380
aware of technologies to block it you

1062
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,090
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> even though i'm allowed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1063
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:51,800
that page that's the whitelist question

1064
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:54,110
I thought he was asking I'm allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1065
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,970
go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that page but how would I not see</font>

1066
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:57,770
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that page is serving up I don't</font>

1067
00:45:55,970 --> 00:46:01,730
know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer to that but certainly</font>

1068
00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:03,170
you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> could like I said is the</font>

1069
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:06,320
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fast in this industry</font>

1070
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:07,970
it wouldn't wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprise me but</font>

1071
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:11,920
that's a definite vector were threats

1072
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:11,919
are coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> through yes sir</font>

1073
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:36,650
they do there's there's a company called

1074
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:41,029
webroot we use a company called opendns

1075
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:42,710
and that they use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology a lot</font>

1076
00:46:41,029 --> 00:46:45,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I said about the</font>

1077
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:47,690
dynamic nature of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks they use</font>

1078
00:46:45,559 --> 00:47:10,130
the heuristics more so than the

1079
00:46:47,690 --> 00:47:11,239
definition base and you're right and

1080
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:14,509
that's why i said<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> error</font>

1081
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:17,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">is there's a number one it's a human</font>

1082
00:47:14,509 --> 00:47:18,950
error is the human error or the users

1083
00:47:17,089 --> 00:47:20,538
not using the technology properly and

1084
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:22,640
not being proper it's usually not being

1085
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:23,930
properly trained if people aren't being

1086
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,239
malicious when they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> in their work</font>

1087
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:28,160
computers they just don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what not</font>

1088
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:30,829
to click on and so we actually will give

1089
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,979
mean just we give classes to our

1090
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:35,630

1091
00:47:33,979 --> 00:47:37,759

1092
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:40,940
