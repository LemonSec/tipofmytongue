00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,830
hi folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> R&G here unfortunately it</font>

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:06,330
didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the microphone on until the</font>

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,030
three minutes then check it<font color="#CCCCCC"> walks so</font>

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,240
fast for<font color="#CCCCCC"> there for the audio so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i put in</font>

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,239
could be

6
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:47,879
you

7
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:22,950
hello hi oh I gotta tone it down<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

8
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,050
so like I said melody ransomware that's

9
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,579
what we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here today so we're</font>

10
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,770
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whole bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

11
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,840
topics that are pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> important and i'm</font>

12
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:33,720
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to kick it off really fast so</font>

13
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,540
the intro what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ransomware heard that</font>

14
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,700
outside our ransomware is essentially a

15
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,650
really nasty type of malware that likes

16
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,230
to disrupt your access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a computer</font>

17
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,840
usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> through encrypting some type of</font>

18
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">files and it says hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pay the ransom to</font>

19
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,180
get your files back or to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> access</font>

20
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:53,010
back to your system so every type and

21
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,750
strain is completely different<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses</font>

22
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:58,649
different types of encryption that's

23
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,030
different solutions constantly changing

24
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,200
so as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> come up with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

25
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,600
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back and find a new one</font>

26
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,810
varies and level of sophistication

27
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,870
intrusiveness persistent summers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

28
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,340
just stupid lock screens could go from

29
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything to that to totally completely</font>

30
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,320
owning your system an attack basically

31
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:19,440
sent around either just blocking access

32
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,340
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your computer or device or encrypting</font>

33
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,610
data and holding your files hostage must

34
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,200
form start off as any form of an hour

35
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:34,650
really does<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some type of fishing</font>

36
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:38,340
link or some type of studio email<font color="#CCCCCC"> based</font>

37
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:40,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">key brain so the first type of</font>

38
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,770
ransomware was written in 1989 it asked

39
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,870
for 189 dollars look all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> AIDS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trojan</font>

40
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,940
it didn't actually do anything it just

41
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,410
encrypted the<font color="#E5E5E5"> names of files and move</font>

42
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,110
them around on the system so people

43
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,460
thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their files again but</font>

44
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,980
today's ransomware is a lot more

45
00:04:53,460 --> 00:05:00,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">sophisticated it's a lot more lucrative</font>

46
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:02,220
so in 2016 they expected the number of

47
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,460
variants expanded by somewhere between

48
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:08,130
11 and 30 times it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally a booming</font>

49
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,719
industry right now an average<font color="#E5E5E5"> ransom was</font>

50
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:13,140
about six hundred and seventy nine

51
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,300
dollars per machine and for corporations

52
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,159
it can be as high as 60 thousand dollars

53
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,840
in terms of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're paying to get</font>

54
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,130
the data back there were approximately

55
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,690
638 million ransom or attacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 2016 so</font>

56
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,320
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 seconds the consumer with it</font>

57
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,510
and every 40 seconds of business with it

58
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,070
so when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the amount of</font>

59
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,510
cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to see in the</font>

60
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">landscape is becoming really</font>

61
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:37,789
increasingly common ransomware payouts

62
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:43,310
likely top approximately 1 billion

63
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:45,260
dollars last year said we have a plan

64
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:48,590
overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to get through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

65
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,719
so some of the fun ones that were in the

66
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:54,229
news over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last few months there was</font>

67
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:58,910
the DC police surveillance one it

68
00:05:54,230 --> 00:06:01,490
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> lacked out 123</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of 187 of their</font>

69
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,900
closed circuit TV camera DVRs so they

70
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,750
weren't able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to record data for</font>

71
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,549
approximately three days they actually

72
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">didn't have to pay in this instance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

73
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,580
they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to restore everything</font>

74
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,700
using their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources so this one</font>

75
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:17,090
actually had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good outcome um</font>

76
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:19,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">smart TVs are finally starting to get</font>

77
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:22,250
hit this makes me feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> justified in why</font>

78
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,930
I don't want to buy a smart TV they

79
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,910
asked for five hundred dollars to unlock

80
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,550
it also says it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the FBI that's</font>

81
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,620
one of my favorite things repairs are

82
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,970
about three hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty dollars so</font>

83
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,250
at some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> buying a new TV you might</font>

84
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:38,150
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> be less costly than trying to</font>

85
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:40,190
fix with yourself if there's some type

86
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,530
of sketchy<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party application to</font>

87
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:46,490
watch movies most<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely pirated movies</font>

88
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:47,989
to be careful out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there consumers have a</font>

89
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,690
difficult time dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

90
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:53,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">because a lot of manufacturers make such</font>

91
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,770
a reset of a TV very difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

92
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,420
consumer so they try to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

93
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">that shop so you'll pay that extra fee</font>

94
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,070
so in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes it's a little</font>

95
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:03,740
hard to fix these devices because its

96
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,719
proprietary knowledge but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> great news</font>

97
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,400
is most people to store to the data on

98
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,600
their TV so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like they're really</font>

99
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:14,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be missing something that's</font>

100
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:18,440
crucial this was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite</font>

101
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:20,060
there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotel in Austria where no</font>

102
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,820
guests could get back into their hotel

103
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,350
room they had actually taken over the

104
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,420
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that did all the key cards and</font>

105
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:29,090
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> locked them out so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

106
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,710
couldn't actually create new keys they

107
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,510
had to pay approximately eighteen

108
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,849
hundred dollars that was the market

109
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:37,930
price<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two bitcoins to get people</font>

110
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,930
back into their hotel rooms

111
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:46,469
now Jerry get to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> mole hey</font>

112
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jared I was actually a</font>

117
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:00,869
bit about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some mobile device ransomware</font>

118
00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:04,229
here so in regards to iOS ransomware

119
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:05,909
sometimes you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the screen you'll</font>

120
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:08,429
say this device is locked pay me this

121
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:11,998
money and send it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me some sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

122
00:08:08,429 --> 00:08:14,369
communication to this email<font color="#CCCCCC"> address so</font>

123
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:17,639
in regards to this the good news is your

124
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:19,469
iphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not act but your iCloud is so</font>

125
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,409
someone went into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your iCloud account</font>

126
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:25,019
went on find my iphone and said make

127
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:26,519
this the lock screen if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

128
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:28,349
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get around this all you have</font>

129
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:30,719
to do is put in your passcode or change

130
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:34,519
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> password on the iCloud but people</font>

131
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">get so freaked out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by this they actually</font>

132
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,780
communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with these people send them</font>

133
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,080
the money and they reset it but still

134
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:48,689
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to their iCloud so it's</font>

135
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,370
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a huge scare tactic but at</font>

136
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,250
this point there's no known iOS

137
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:59,190
ransomware on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and non jailbroken iPhones</font>

138
00:08:53,250 --> 00:09:02,160
Androids a different story so new

139
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,110
ransomware reaches google play store so

140
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,620
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened back in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> January with this</font>

141
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:10,200
energy rescue app basically this

142
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,350
application steals users text messages

143
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">and contacts list and then locks the</font>

144
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:18,030
phone this one is huge because of the

145
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,220
first ransomware that ever reached the

146
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:25,470
google play store it was able to bypass

147
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:28,230
security by having encrypted encrypted

148
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,870
code and it routinely checked if the app

149
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,580
was being run<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Android emulator so</font>

150
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,700
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone like Google was testing it in</font>

151
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:40,710
an emulator it halted everything and was

152
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:43,590
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hide itself so some trends going</font>

153
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:46,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">on right now there's been an increase by</font>

154
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:49,830
fifty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attacks and from in</font>

155
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:51,300
2016 from 2015 most ransomware

156
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,490
discovered in apps installed from

157
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,170
outside of the google play store so you

158
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,590
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a spam email or something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:03,510
smarter<font color="#E5E5E5"> these days now you can wipe the</font>

164
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:19,949
right now so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an example</font>

165

screen with something you'd see so like

166
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">I said before the only known case of</font>

ransomware after reaching the google

168
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:31,230
play store is that battery saver so some

169

ransomware families in the for<font color="#E5E5E5"> android</font>

with and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are actually paying this</font>

176
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:47,070
so the adult player this one was my

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,979
personal favorite it's just in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

know along a little bit later maybe a

185
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:07,380
few hours whatever and it would take

you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> blowed up Chase Bank say</font>

this is my username and password you're

not actually logging in the chase bank

you're logging<font color="#CCCCCC"> in to basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">bloggers and they get that information</font>

206
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:59,910
that's all i have for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

207
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's talk a little about triaging</font>

208
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,870
ransomware but first<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to talk</font>

209
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what ransomware is and how it</font>

210
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">works so I'm a malware writer i'm gonna</font>

211
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:10,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">offer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some ransomware basically what i</font>

212
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:14,040
do is i generate a pair of a

213
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:15,329
public/private key pair do you guys have

214
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever encrypt nating you know how this</font>

215
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:21,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">works</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i keep my private key pair my</font>

216
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:23,970
private key private to me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i take the</font>

217
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:26,820
public key and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually embed it in my</font>

218
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:29,130
mouth where and then I send it out I can

219
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,930
either find vulnerabilities that I can

220
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:33,150
exploit weak passwords where I can log

221
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,069
into a system and execute it you can

222
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,980
embed it in malicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> office documents</font>

223
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:40,230
and send it out via<font color="#CCCCCC"> email you can use</font>

224
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,690
basically any method you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of to</font>

225
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:46,860
get malware on a machine vulnerable

226
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:48,270
vulnerable versions of flash<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java all of</font>

227
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,600
those have been known to drop a

228
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:54,150
ransomware file on a machine once it

229
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,040
actually runs on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your machine your</font>

230
00:12:54,150 --> 00:13:00,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will generate a private key</font>

231
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:04,099
pair just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a private key it can use</font>

232
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:06,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like cpuid MAC address IP address</font>

233
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,920
some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of unique identifier that's</font>

234
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,199
unique to your hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes it'll</font>

235
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,240
just randomly generate one typically to

236
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:16,490
use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft crypto API they don't</font>

237
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to actually put a ton of extras</font>

238
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,930
extra code in there and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will</font>

239
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,199
start crawling through your machine and

240
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:26,870
encrypting all your files your private

241
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:30,050
key that you generated is what is

242
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:33,230
required to unlock all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your files and</font>

243
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:37,040
they get encrypted that private key is

244
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:40,220
then actually re encrypted with a public

245
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,569
key that's embedded in their meaning the

246
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,550
only way to get that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through the</font>

247
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:45,529
private<font color="#E5E5E5"> key that I still hold so you pay</font>

248
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:48,500
me money I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your public I get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

249
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:50,839
symmetric key that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you generated I use</font>

250
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,670
my private key I unencrypted it and then

251
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:54,589
you then have the pass phrase or the

252
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:58,189
equivalent key that will go through and

253
00:13:54,589 --> 00:14:00,440
decrypt your files this is typically

254
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:03,319
when you start to have a bad day this

255
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a ransomware variant that actually</font>

256
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:08,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">claimed to do full disk encryption so</font>

257
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:10,160
rather than krypton individual files it

258
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:13,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually just encrypted the Master Boot</font>

259
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,839
Record on the machine and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then blue</font>

260
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,930
screened it so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it came back on</font>

261
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,360
this is the screen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got where</font>

262
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:23,420
you had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in to one of these onion</font>

263
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:27,259
URLs on the on the dark web put that

264
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:30,050
encryption key in and pay them and you

265
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:31,880
could get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your money back this actually</font>

266
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:35,540
didn't encrypt all the files on the

267
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:38,120
system so if you remove the hard drive

268
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:41,269
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> past the MBR you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

269
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:46,009
actually see all of your files and<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

270
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:48,079
so this just encrypted the MBR get help

271
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:50,089
if you actually figure that you are

272
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,319
compromised with ransomware our company

273
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:54,439
you're working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's been breached</font>

274
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:56,449
with the ransomware I have to say after

275
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:58,250
working a ton of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases the</font>

276
00:14:56,449 --> 00:15:01,399
security department and the IT

277
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:04,310
department are my worst nightmare they

278
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:08,089
screw things up then they possibly can

279
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:10,069
help so stop what you're doing breathe

280
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:13,920
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know make sure management doesn't</font>

281
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:15,870
lose lose their minds and

282
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,599
if you have cyber breach insurance you

283
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,279
might want to look at it some companies

that can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved that can help you</font>

291
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,260
with ransomware that could cause you to

292
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,490
do a data breach disclosure notification

293
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:42,750
where you have to send out<font color="#E5E5E5"> those nasty</font>

294
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:44,730
letters you've got to move fast so

295
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:47,459
quarantine and triage these devices as

296
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:49,709
quick as you can sometimes the

297
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:51,810
ransomware won't go up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs the</font>

298
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:57,388
longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> you wait so the facts you pay</font>

299
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:59,339
them the cheaper it is it depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

300
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:01,769
whether or not what got encrypted is it

301
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:05,430
an end-user laptop is it a server how

302
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:07,529
critical is it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your business a lot of</font>

303
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:10,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">the insurance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> claims can be based off of</font>

306
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,680
they're actually paying a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

309
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,610
network most of the ransomware out there

310
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,050
now won't just encrypt your local

311
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,970
machine it also tries to use your

312
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:30,810
credentials or escalate privileges and

313
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:32,490
crawl the network and create a log of

314
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,109
these infected devices and prioritize

315
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,540
them who has the most important data

316
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:40,829
which ones would you want to decrypt

317
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:42,480
faster you've got backups right most

318
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:45,089
businesses are like yes we back up

319
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have backups awesome if</font>

320
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:49,949
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is backed up there's no ransom</font>

321
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:54,839
to pay restore your backup patch move on

322
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:57,149
oftentimes backups will get encrypted

323
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,490
I've got this last one on there<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

324
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:01,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">they near time snapshots and replication</font>

325
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:04,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is popular for businesses now where</font>

326
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:07,919
they've got two offices and one office

327
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:09,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">almir another office so if a server gets</font>

328
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,030
hit with ransomware basically all it

329
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,980
does is say okay great<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

330
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,480
all the files that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are my backup on this</font>

331
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,939
other office and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it replicates them down</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">encrypts all of their backups and</font>

snapshots in<font color="#E5E5E5"> real time</font>

334
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:25,530
if you're gonna be back up your data is

335
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,449
encrypted it's important you're probably

336
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,470
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to pay the ransom ware but</font>

337
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:31,380
there's the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you need to</font>

338
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:32,880
sort of figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do figure out what</font>

339
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,100
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ransomware you have and is it</font>

340
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,780
actually a ransomware there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

341
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,699
rent somewhere out there that was just a

342
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">lock screen just becomes annoying just</font>

343
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,450
prevent sort of an<font color="#CCCCCC"> end user from getting</font>

344
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,880
access to their desktop or getting

345
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,770
access to certain files some of the

346
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,960
ransomware only just<font color="#CCCCCC"> export data</font>

347
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:54,810
basically just bitch shit that you can

348
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:56,580
get past and just get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your data back</font>

349
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,899
some of the ransomware is actually crap

350
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,270
where they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do in bed the</font>

351
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,650
private key in there so if you go

352
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:04,650
through the malware and reverse it you

353
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:07,410
can pull the key back out and and

354
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:10,170
decrypt your files you know doing

355
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:13,380
encryption properly is hard so the

356
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:18,210
malware writers don't get it right all

357
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:20,760
the time figuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what kind of</font>

358
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,410
ransomware you have the screen the

359
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:26,220
whatever ransom screen guy that gets

360
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:27,480
popped up will be a clue sometimes there

361
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,610
are email addresses that are listed

362
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,910
files will get renamed or appended with

363
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:35,280
the email addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Bitcoin wallet</font>

364
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:38,850
they're asking you to pay money to can

365
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,139
help you identify this doing internet

366
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:44,639
research and figure out what kind of

367
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:46,170
ransomware you have will help if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw</font>

368
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,930
the initial triage you know what are

369
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:50,760
your files encrypted strain of

370
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:54,930
ransomware how many machines do you have

371
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,210
and how much data if no solution can be

372
00:18:54,930 --> 00:19:00,120
found you can always try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get your</font>

373
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:01,980
data back through forensic means most of

374
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,659
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> ransomware now in fact all of it</font>

375
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,700
that I've seen will go through and

376
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,990
delete<font color="#E5E5E5"> your volume shadow copies you're</font>

377
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,550
doing forensics you know that volume

378
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:12,090
shadow copies are those snapshots and

379
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:13,649
your previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> versions of files so the</font>

380
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:16,949
initial sort of first round of

381
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:18,840
ransomware that came out everybody like

382
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">whoa I can just right click on this file</font>

383
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:25,980
say show<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous version get that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5</font>

384
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:27,150
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and I'm good these will go</font>

385
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">through and delete all your shadow</font>

386
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,410
copies the thing to note is that it

387
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,650
doesn't actually do any sort of secure

388
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,510
delete or overwrite

389
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,640
so even though they run this command and

390
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,470
delete all<font color="#E5E5E5"> your volume shadow copies</font>

391
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,330
they're still<font color="#CCCCCC"> there you can still</font>

392
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:45,070
recover them and you can still<font color="#CCCCCC"> partially</font>

393
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:48,220
get some data back sometimes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

394
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,270
you know good old data recovery this is

395
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,090
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're probably learning</font>

396
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:56,950
in class and you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done for typical</font>

397
00:19:52,090 --> 00:20:00,310
data recovery you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can file carve you can</font>

398
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:02,800
go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for different types</font>

of files not all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data gets encrypted</font>

400
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:10,000
you usually certain file extensions that

401
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:12,130
it goes after quarantine your devices do

402
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,200
not start running antivirus on them and

403
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:16,090
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of it sometimes the malware</font>

404
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,580
itself the ransomware that gets put in

405
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:22,330
your system actually has<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code in it</font>

406
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:24,189
to decrypt and unlock the files if the

407
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:26,980
antivirus goes through and starts

408
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:31,240
finding in the malware and deleting it

409
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:33,100
you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that mauer around anymore</font>

410
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:43,750
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually decrypt your data</font>

411

having a personal knowledge base<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

somewhere to look is it's helpful we'll

413
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:51,429
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some of this a little bit</font>

414

though I've only paid for one host it

431
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,380
might work across every single host

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:06,740
basically hosted up this page here where

any variance of ransomware that they

456

than corporate documents and company

460
00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:01,400
databases so I may actually want you to

461
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:03,080
engage them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what type of</font>

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can decrypt your data but</font>

468
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,049
typically they just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out</font>

what company you're working for whose

00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,070
while individuals are getting hit with

00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:27,230
ransomware payments<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're five hundred</font>

476
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:40,090
ransomware is a problem it's growing and

477
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:44,620
it's growing because it actually works

478
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:46,090
the fact that actually works means

479
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,100
they're making a ton of money off of it

480
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,480
the only way to really stop it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

481
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,149
stop paying them<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find a way around</font>

482
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,799
it but it perpetuates the scheme it

483
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:55,418
makes it more likely to get struck again

484
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:58,809
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having companies that have</font>

485
00:23:55,419 --> 00:24:00,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually paid ransoms and then not</font>

486
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:02,289
cleaned up and gotten their systems

487
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:06,279
encrypted again and I've had to pay it

488
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:08,860
twice if you need to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> contact with</font>

489
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:10,360
somebody to negotiate your ransom you've

490
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,209
got to use a ton of social engineering

491
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:16,870
skills don't be emailing them from a

492
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:18,669
corporate email address pretend you're a

493
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:21,820
little little lady who has no idea

494
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:29,139
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you know try to get that</font>

495
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:30,519
ransom down as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you can typically</font>

496
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:33,969
they want ransomware in a form of

497
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:37,360
Bitcoin some of them asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for gift</font>

498
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:40,210
cards and other types of payment but

499
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,549
it's typically Bitcoin if you've not

500
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:45,039
already set up a method to purchase

501

Bitcoin it can take a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

502
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,158
go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like coinbase you try to get</font>

503
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:49,960
an account they've got to validate your

504
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,669
bank accounts you want to buy bitcoin it

505
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,320
can take two or<font color="#CCCCCC"> three days you might be</font>

506
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:56,889
limited to the amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin that</font>

507
00:24:53,320 --> 00:25:00,009
you can actually purchase and the entire

00:24:56,889 --> 00:25:01,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">time you're you're down your systems are</font>

509
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:04,360
down so there are other ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

510
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,919
Bitcoin but you ever walk in the

511
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,979
situation we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty thousand dollars</font>

512
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:14,019
in Bitcoin in less than 24 hours that

513
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:16,899
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pretty difficult</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> transmit neither</font>

514
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:19,389
ransomware funds typically want to send

515
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:21,428
things through a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tumbler best practices</font>

516
00:25:19,389 --> 00:25:27,039
take your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin tumble them anonymize</font>

517
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:30,100
it a little bit keep track of where the

518
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,450
money goes which<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address you can</font>

519
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,610
trace that down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you a</font>

00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:35,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about how that works here and</font>

521
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:41,510
this guy so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a guy we dealt with</font>

522
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:45,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> few months ago back in August</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of 2016</font>

523
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:47,930
at the time that we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

524
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:50,000
this guy is<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a hundred and forty-six</font>

525
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:52,730
transactions to one wallet address is

526
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,840
about 1.2<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin so today's value a</font>

527
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:59,360
little over 1,500 bucks for 148

528
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,649
ransomware infections and we started

529
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,490
tracing him through the block Shan

530
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:06,440
figured out where he goes and then you

531
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:09,320
see all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other smaller wallets that</font>

532
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">he was using to generate his ransomware</font>

533
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,780
payments getting merge into a larger

534
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:16,190
wallet and as of a few days<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago he was</font>

535
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,230
doing pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good so it's about eight</font>

536
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:21,080
months with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work and he ended up</font>

537
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:22,880
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a little bit less</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than nine</font>

538
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,320
hundred thousand bucks so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

539
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,560
bad for a few days worth of work<font color="#E5E5E5"> for one</font>

540
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:32,120
ransomware variant so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's profitable</font>

541
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:35,120
they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know keeping</font>

542
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,560
track of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin addresses and where</font>

543
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,899
that goes and following step through the

544
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,179
block chain is helpful especially if you

545
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:43,670
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with law enforcement eventually</font>

546
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,500
these guys will get caught<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually</font>

547
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:48,260
their Bitcoin will get confiscated and

548
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,850
if you've got a record of you paying

549
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:52,310
Bitcoin following through the block

550
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:54,919
chain you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance of getting some</font>

551
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,760
of your money back<font color="#E5E5E5"> Melody's going to</font>

552
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:01,220
talk about cooperating with law

553
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:04,310
enforcement so one of the really

554
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:07,160
important things in general is

555
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:08,090
cooperating with other organizations so

556
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,290
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about law</font>

557
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:13,610
enforcement but they're not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

558
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:15,080
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously so information sharing</font>

559
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:17,060
with law enforcement agencies is

560
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:20,179
extremely important for any type of case

561
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:24,679
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone involving some type of</font>

562
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:26,450
financial items incidents are

563
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,970
underreported so that makes

564
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:32,090
investigations really difficult they act

565
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:34,820
the FBI they put out this like little

566
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:38,750
report every year about sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like the</font>

567
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:39,919
state of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber security and I think it</font>

568
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:42,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">was somewhere between thirty and forty</font>

569
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:45,650
percent is what they're estimating is

570
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,790
being reported a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people aren't</font>

571
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,710
reporting<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they don't want to</font>

572
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,720
send out those data breach notices the

keep it in-house and they try to hide it

is definitely sort of recommended you

caught because you've actually given all

this information to law enforcement they

preventing some infections and looking

610
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:27,320
for data rod ransom was profitable

611
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,510
that's why we see so much of it you've

612
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,639
data literally held at ransom it's

613

information that you need and you're

614
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">willing to pay to get it back it's not</font>

is making this even better TV's cameras

617
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,900
all that other weird peripheral stuff

618

that you can't patch and manage that's

619
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:50,150
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start getting taken over I can</font>

620
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,570
see this coming up in the winter where

00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:55,850
your neph thermostat gets stuck at 55

622
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:57,200
degrees on like the coldest day ever and

623
00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:00,290
they're like give me a hundred bucks

this is coming your antivirus sucks I've

626
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:10,070
actually not worked a ransomware case

627
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:11,450
where we've had an infection every

application whitelisting is also a great

<font color="#CCCCCC">way to do this it can be a pain in the</font>

ass to manage on end points but for

638
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,220
servers and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other critical</font>

639

infrastructure where there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot</font>

00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:44,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">going on whitelisting is is the way to</font>

641
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,629
go that's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of blocking this stuff a</font>

642
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:51,620
lot of this is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down to</font>

643
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:56,480
education most of the ransomware that

644
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:58,729
get infected is coming from some user

645
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,160
doing something stupid they're clicking

646
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:03,800
on email attachments they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

647
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">shady websites and they're getting</font>

648
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,000
downloads and they're clicking on those

649
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:09,260
better training and better security

650
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,550
habits will help you prevent this

00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:15,650
backing up obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're there's</font>

652
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:17,780
nothing to pay there's no ransom nothing

653
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:20,540
is hostage you have a copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your data</font>

654
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:25,160
somewhere backing it up making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:26,570
not accessible is a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep you from</font>

656
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and make sure you have a plan</font>

657
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:30,980
your environment changes making sure you

658
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,159
have a knowledge base or somewhere you

659
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:35,930
can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> for resources I'm kind of shocked</font>

660
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,540
at how little some of the rent somewhere

661
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:41,210
community people have actually paid

662

been no database of like known keys that

664
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:48,770
people pay for ransom or with you can

665
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,540
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I paid a</font>

ransom does it actually work am I

667
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:54,530
getting my data back okay here's the key

668
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:57,800
is there a way for me to figure out how

669
00:31:54,530 --> 00:32:00,860
to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that key with the ransomware</font>

670
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,690
itself to figure out if there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wider</font>

decryption for that entire string it's

not happening a lot

673
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,570
identifying the root cause we hear a lot

<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a PT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right they had advanced</font>

is out this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> just came out a few</font>

690
00:32:45,529 --> 00:32:51,590
weeks ago I liked it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

the most user-friendly ransomware that

ever existed you got this nice little

693
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:04,070
screen it was awesome you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know designs</font>

694
00:32:57,049 --> 00:33:07,250
well they use they tell you the type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

695
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:08,840
encryption you're using or was also

696
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:11,779
interesting because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the when it</font>

697
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,879
generated that symmetric<font color="#E5E5E5"> key for</font>

encryption of files it didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

699
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,380
transfer it back so you could actually

700
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:22,100
get this ransomware air gap and the

701
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:26,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">private key did not need to go back to</font>

private key here that was encrypted and

when you actually went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the website it</font>

706
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,500
was great<font color="#E5E5E5"> they told you get to upload</font>

track things for you how many files you

got encrypted what your timeline was it

711
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:52,700
had a chat window where you can actually

start chatting and getting tech support

713
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:58,490
on how to buy bitcoins they would

encrypt two of your decrypt<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-year</font>

files for<font color="#CCCCCC"> free just to prove that it</font>

716
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:07,189
works they offered immunity which was

717
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:09,379
really cool they basically the malware

718
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:12,889
looked for a specific file in a registry

719
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:14,480
key and if you pay the fifty dollars for

720
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:16,310
immunity

721
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,929
you got another application you ran that

722
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,830
just put a registry key and a file in

723
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:20,570
there that would prevent you from

724
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:22,699
getting rien cryptid so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

725
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,200
basically fifty dollars to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

726
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:27,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">want my data back but I don't want to be</font>

727
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:30,138
hit again so but it was only $79 to

728
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,840
restore<font color="#CCCCCC"> your files and they had a</font>

729
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:38,389
deadline in a payment so it was great

730
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:43,580
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really good at it this</font>

731
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:45,560
is another<font color="#CCCCCC"> one that we did recently this</font>

732
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:49,040
is what I'd like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> call good bad</font>

733
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:55,820
ransomware they had the encryption right

734
00:34:49,040 --> 00:35:00,080
but they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> a complete idiot they were</font>

735
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:03,170
using week credentials to log into

736
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:06,890
systems through rdp team you or whatever

737
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:08,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">they can get their hands on the system</font>

738
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:10,670
that we took a look at this is the

739
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,210
screen that they got it was just licked

740
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:16,220
an HTML page that got spun and got fired

741
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:18,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">up and there was an India</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> calm address</font>

742
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,149
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> emailed them and</font>

743
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:22,160
go through negotiate how much you were

744
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:28,490
getting I'm gonna have to pay to gear

745
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:31,339
your data back they did encrypted files

746
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:36,109
the malware wasn't really that

747
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:38,570
sophisticated but in this case they had

748
00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:41,240
actually managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get enterprise admin</font>

749
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:42,710
or domain admin credentials and log<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

750
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,029
a machine through remote desktop that

751
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:46,340
was sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> publicly on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

752
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:48,080
they had no<font color="#E5E5E5"> clue what they were doing</font>

753
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,730
they were in and out in seven minutes

754
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,230
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they did not realize they had like</font>

755
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:53,690
domain admin credentials otherwise they

756
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:56,210
could have inspected everything they

<font color="#E5E5E5">basically logged in opened up a web</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was it you trying to explain to</font>

761
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:06,350
somebody that was our enterprise admin

00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:09,230
account why<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything there's just not</font>

763
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:14,990
smart right you can't ask why for<font color="#E5E5E5"> idiots</font>

764
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:17,510
we had this machine about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

765
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:20,959
six or seven hours after initially got

766
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:23,480
infected we did work with them we're

767
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to restore some back up again this</font>

768
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,320
didn't encrypt a ton of data file listed

769
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:29,759
was going after was pretty bad

770
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,580
and it didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply to this</font>

771
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,890
system so there was no payment but we

772
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:36,210
thought we'd go through anyway and just

773
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:39,029
kind of communicate with these people

774
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a burner gmail account and see how</font>

775
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:45,840
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really asking for</font>

776
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:47,130
bounced right so the only method to

777
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,050
communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with his people was email</font>

778
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:52,830
addresses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was already blocked and</font>

779
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:54,300
bounced so 12 hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> later there was no</font>

780
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,890
way to actually communicate with anybody

781
00:36:54,300 --> 00:37:00,540
if you did want your data back it wasn't

782

<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen shameless plug we're</font>

they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a lot better they're not</font>

your data and move it off and they'll

801
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,970
sort of threaten to disclose it if you

it is an industry services specific

805
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:33,070
problem and that's the situation where

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a network we got in late on</font>

that there could have been a better job

60 grand talk to you pay and not receive

anything back not honestly not very

an ad hoc one most of the popular

the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ransomware is becoming</font>

so successful right it works if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

didn't get your<font color="#E5E5E5"> data back and you've</font>

829
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,810
paid then it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get out there</font>

that hey if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for lucky I'm liking</font>

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it they don't make any money so</font>

something you can put on your systems to

834
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,690
basically start to look for like

835
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,550
activity of ransomware we're like large

836
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:20,380
amounts of files are being that's going

837
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:26,370
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be your antivirus and it's just not</font>

838
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:26,370
it's not working out that well

839
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:45,360
honey pasta<font color="#E5E5E5"> detective the methods for</font>

840
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:48,480
malware writers we do use these so every

841
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:51,180
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get a piece of ransomware will</font>

842
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,930
sandbox it and figure out what it does

843
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:59,370
often times it will try to offload

844
00:40:54,930 --> 00:41:00,660
either files or at least your private

845
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:03,420
symmetric key that's used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> encryption</font>

846
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:05,040
it'll try to throw that back<font color="#E5E5E5"> over so you</font>

847
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:08,910
can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in a packet capture at</font>

848
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:11,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">some time the URLs where it's shoving</font>

849
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:15,690
that some of that data off<font color="#CCCCCC"> to can be</font>

850
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:18,570
helpful sometimes the initial malware

851
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:20,700
it's just like a it's a dropper so it

852
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:24,540
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a word doc with a macro in it</font>

853
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:26,069
or something that's fairly benign but

854
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:28,050
will actually go out to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet and</font>

855
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:30,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">then download something else and execute</font>

856
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:38,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so figuring out where that stuff</font>

857
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:41,520

00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,610
of the ransomware is deleting the volume

862
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,080
shadow copies but it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> securely</font>

863
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,850
deleting them so you can still pull

864
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:14,730
those back off and get prior versions

865
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:18,690
depending on your system you know you

not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that on a server</font>

870
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:32,950
and it depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of file we</font>

have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of go through and</font>

872

do data carbine and fine previous

00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:53,170
just need access to a small amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

886
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,890

887
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,470
starts crawling file shares and then

encrypting an entire network file shares
