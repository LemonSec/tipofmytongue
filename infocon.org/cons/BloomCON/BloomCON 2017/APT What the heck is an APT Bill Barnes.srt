53
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,988
recently it's been started with

54
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:22,480
spearfishing campaigns why because our

55
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:24,970
users still<font color="#E5E5E5"> click on the link</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it 2017</font>

56
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,879
guys we kind of work on getting the

57
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,859
users about click on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> links a couple</font>

58
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:31,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago they would just buy ads and</font>

59
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:33,879
web you know and Google and stuff to

60
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:35,138
have you do drive-bys but they weren't

61
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:37,659
getting the targets they were looking

62
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:44,019
for so now they're really focusing in on

63
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:45,849
spearfishing these tax use off<font color="#E5E5E5"> mutations</font>

64
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:47,919
so what they do is is the ones they get

65
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:50,108
it set toolset that they like that's

66
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,150
working at skim results they<font color="#E5E5E5"> constantly</font>

67
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:55,840
change it so that signature base

68
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:58,569
defenses are useless they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font>

69
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,879
looking on data and there always seems

00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:02,440
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for keeping access so if</font>

they don't find anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful today</font>

00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,090
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stick around see look in</font>

three months six months 12 months

74
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,229
there's been cases where it's in years

they're hanging around in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a network just</font>

gloom well it is but not quite all doom

79
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,070
and gloom I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give a little</font>

do you prevent this kind of stuff number

one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> train your users now</font>

00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:34,969
up to fall for the fishes and that is

84
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,800
really really really hard some

85
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,080
automation in your network the look at

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,550
Bill Barnes to be encrypting files it is

89
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,470
very unusual for places I thought

90
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:51,200
encryption to be using encryption

91
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:55,100
therefore I always flags is something

92
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,659
unusual suspicious go check it out watch

00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,970
last year we only caught because we saw

96
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:08,390
making calls to the same DNS host it was

97
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:11,690

00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:21,170
keep up-to-date and current trends and

102

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,210
clicking on the link therefore endpoints

117
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:00,650
of the key because that's where they

118
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:03,080
start this whole thing so some quick

119
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:07,789
device keep in mind as we're going

120
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:13,099
through here don't panic it's very very

121
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:15,590
very easy to panic don't panic nothing

122
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,240
is ever as it seems as I found now six

123
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:21,320
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven times as we've gone through all</font>

this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> bias be aware of your own</font>

125
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:27,830
bias I keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the time stuff I</font>

126
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:30,680
did ten years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm like all I</font>

127
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:33,020
know this and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually starting</font>

128
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,480
to look like some of the more skilled

129
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,280
actors or layering stuff the kind of

130
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,849
hide what's really going on with

131
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,270
run-of-the-mill malware

132
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:44,979
correlation does not causation because

133
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">every time I hear somebody on the TV</font>

134
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:50,679
sync Russians they're talking about

135
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:54,009
fellation implies causation but so be

136
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:58,089
careful that likewise Occam's razor then

137
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:59,949
we know Occam's razor is yes whatever is

138
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:03,429
the least amount of assumptions is

139
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:05,619
probably it and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how this usually</font>

140
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:07,089
boils down and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next trivia</font>

141
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:08,080
question I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought something was</font>

142
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:17,529
fundamentally wrong with the universe

143
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:19,839
name the book what but not your even

144
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:24,580
closer it's one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those series</font>

145
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:30,039
restaurant hasn't burst how's that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

146
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:33,308
obscure so I get daily summaries from

270
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:50,050
you're going through and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start</font>

271

274
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,440
this doesn't make any sense but they're

275
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:03,550
saying because because they run show no

276
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,920
se the message that they want to say

277
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:08,829
it's obviously part of the cyber camping

278
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,349
so no wonder our senators are so damn

279

December 28th ripping it apart webinar

290
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,040
if I had more<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I'd actually go into</font>

291
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,840
some of the slides because he does a

292
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,709
really nice couple slides where he talks

293
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:52,300
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard attribution really is the</font>

294
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,520
piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the puzzle we're missing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

295
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,310
action is is they have no secondary

296
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">authenticator telling us that this is</font>

297
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:03,160
real and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that always ends up being spies</font>

298
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,420
so that part of course classified so of

299
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,620
course we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

300
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,569
basically goes through the whole thing

301
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,640
and talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how bad the report is</font>

302
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:12,520
and it's a really you know like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

303
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:16,480
it's an hour webinar go sign up watch it

304

305
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,760
to you I a lot of research i get from

306
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:25,690
fire I because they're very good<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

307
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:29,200
sharing so when this came out I'm like

308
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:31,270
okay I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the webinar webinar</font>

309
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,640

311
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:54,680
thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that one here so this</font>

312
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,850
one was very interesting that once again

313
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,680
they didn't try to prove it was the

314
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:00,560
Russians but they talk about things that

315
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,699
they have found as they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and</font>

316
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:07,969
so they believe the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNC was hacked by</font>

317
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:10,070
the Russians and it's based on when they

318
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:13,400
the things that they found as they were

319
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:17,600
investigating the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> anti-doping</font>

323
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:32,750
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Internet in September evidence</font>

324
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,030
from the world Doping agency that they

325
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:37,820
were letting other countries get medical

326
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:39,319
exceptions for therapeutic stick use for

327
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:43,490
the same stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are banning the</font>

328
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:47,210
Russians for so<font color="#E5E5E5"> after watching this</font>

329
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:49,100
whole thing I'm like okay so I have a

330
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:52,640
few friends that work at Mandy and fire

331
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,170
I they specifically all sent this to me

332
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,740
like you go you got to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through this</font>

333
00:16:54,170 --> 00:17:00,229
one like okay but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what they</font>

334
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,840
found is they did up there they did the

335
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:05,420
exact same thing on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dnc from what</font>

336
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:13,250
they since they were given they didn't

337
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:16,640
do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNC invest another company did so</font>

338
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,650
once again they came out with another

339
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:30,410
enhanced analysis of<font color="#CCCCCC"> grizzly step</font>

340
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:31,059
februari<font color="#E5E5E5"> temp now this one was good this</font>

341
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,159
one may I

342
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:35,110
we sat down as soon as a team and

343
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:40,090
actually you know work things out and

344
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:42,309
this time<font color="#E5E5E5"> the excited stuff so you know</font>

345
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:44,049
where this came from and where there's

346
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:46,690
different information you can go look up

347
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:49,779
the validate they're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in</font>

348
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:55,299
this report and they go on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and on</font>

349
00:17:49,779 --> 00:18:00,129
and on this time they actually gave us

350
00:17:55,299 --> 00:18:02,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">your rules that are more specific to the</font>

351
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:04,360
of trying to get text strings and that

352
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:08,139
kind of stuff to<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to follow as it</font>

353
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,729
mutates the good news is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I took all</font>

354
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:11,619
these your rules and picked a few things

355
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:14,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was worried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> known bad</font>

356
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:17,230
actors none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them hit here at least</font>

357
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:18,759
but i have i have read things on Twitter

358
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">from people saying that they've had hits</font>

359
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:24,159
on them so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting and</font>

360
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,779
it once<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this is another one the</font>

361
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:28,840
other thing too is this one's much

362
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:30,850
longer it went from meal 13 pages 256

363
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:34,509
pages because they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually packed</font>

364
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:36,100
useful information<font color="#CCCCCC"> in here so this one's</font>

365
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:38,529
actually a better one so now i'm parting

366
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,209
to feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> some then robert lee said hey</font>

367
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:41,830
let's do another webinar talking about

368
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,080
that one and that's another one I

369
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:47,289
recommend you go watch on you know as

370
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,749
yet time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he basically comes to the</font>

371
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:52,029
same conclusion that the stuff release

372
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:53,499
is a lot better this time but they<font color="#CCCCCC"> solve</font>

373
00:18:52,029 --> 00:19:00,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">a few things that he would a wish they</font>

374
00:18:53,499 --> 00:19:04,600
did WikiLeaks actually practice that one

375
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:08,440
everything was<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was and then</font>

376
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:14,860
bolt came out did anyway look at volt

377
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:19,240
seven yet I've slides out of order I

378
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:23,559
can't stop reading WikiLeaks I haven't

379
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:26,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">been like two weeks now anyway the</font>

380
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:31,509
interesting part for the dip fuck is

381
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:33,700
tidbit here they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> codename</font>

382
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:36,190
group in there where they are actually

383
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:40,149
faking and truth make it look like

384
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:44,350
somebody else thanks guys now you made

385
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:44,889
everything that much harder at this we

386
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,860
know that they

387
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:51,010
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling techniques from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other groups</font>

388
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:53,139
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what groups they were I'm</font>

389
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:56,950
hoping we're going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a WikiLeaks or</font>

390
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:59,470
they actually say it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pd 28 does it</font>

391
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,360
oops a little bit because right now we

392
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:04,480
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ones they're talking</font>

393
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:09,939
about and now everyone you know freaking

394
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:14,980
out over mac firmware oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't</font>

395
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:21,220
stop reading so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I updated this slide</font>

396
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:23,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">real time just so I still think it's</font>

397
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:26,020
possible because in my mind the Russians

398
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,490
hack in the DNC is the least amount of

399
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:31,480
get you know assumptions that you have

400
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:34,300
to have because even even with the CIA

401
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:40,900
what does the CIA gain from hacking the

402
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:43,450
DNC nothing just you know maybe they

403
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:46,420
didn't like her maybe they're trying to

404
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:48,340
worry pipeline you know so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at a</font>

405
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,750
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> instability in the world it's around</font>

406
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,449
right now it seems to be around natural

407
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:57,700
gas pipeline all these hot spots Syria

408
00:20:52,450 --> 00:21:00,070
Ukraine Turkey Israel Greece the Baltics

409
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,780
it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> about getting pugnac I see</font>

410
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:09,460
Europe where is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number one consumer</font>

411
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:11,740
of natural gas so maybe maybe not I was

412
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty sure of it so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> UM bridge stuff</font>

413
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,060
came out but once again once we get more

414
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,880
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> from WikiLeaks maybe that's</font>

415
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:20,679
going to change anyway one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that</font>

416
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">was interesting during this whole thing</font>

417
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:26,260
with it with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNC specifically there</font>

418
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,200
nothing presented about anyone else

419
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:31,210
being on the network now a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of times</font>

420
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,770
if you're vulnerable to one group you're

421
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,150
vulnerable the other so a lot of times

422
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,920
when we look at this we find two or

423
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,320
three actors working at the same time

424
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:42,760
and they kind of lay low and do their

425
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:44,740
own thing and leave each other alone if

426
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,240
there was no one else in there that's

427
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,880
really worth mentioning does that mean

428
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:53,050
somebody actually was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> kicking other</font>

429
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:55,330
people so it's worth<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioning and no</font>

430
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:58,060
one met any documentation it came out

431
00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:00,220
and oh

432
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:02,110
