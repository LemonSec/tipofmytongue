1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,750
okay um so ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get started today</font>

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,040
we're going to be talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about building</font>

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">a sample vulnerability management</font>

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,810
program for effective risk management I

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:22,500
am Katy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Perry not that one so if you</font>

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,330
showed up<font color="#CCCCCC"> here hoping for a pond concert</font>

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:30,599
then hope you're not too disappointed

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:32,070
okay you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear better okay so I'm the</font>

9
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,370
manager of the vulnerability management

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,530
program at Discovery Communications home

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,010
of the Discovery Channel TLC Animal

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:44,399
Planet velocity among some other pretty

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,989
cool networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and prior</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> current</font>

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,899
role which I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been in for about 10</font>

15
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,510
months now I was at visa at their

16
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,920
vulnerability management team so this

17
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,690
talk is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be based on my</font>

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,500
experience at both of those

19
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,899
organizations so to kind of segue into

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,340
this topic<font color="#CCCCCC"> because probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the</font>

21
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,099
talks you're going to today have been

22
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,110
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> offensive security and so this is</font>

23
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,119
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be about defensive security so</font>

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,729
now that you've identified all these

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,130
vulnerabilities that allow you to

26
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">perform are these cool exploits that</font>

27
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,899
you've been hearing about today where do

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,139
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there in a large environment</font>

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,630
it wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be unusual to have over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

30
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,250
million active vulnerability and then

31
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,189
you probably don't have an extra team

32
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,110
who's dedicated totally to fixing them

33
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,429
so how do you prioritize what do you do

34
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,430
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this huge amount of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data that you</font>

35
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">just got so I'm hoping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that by the end</font>

36
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,900
of the talk on<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're ever given that</font>

37
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,490
task here's your vulnerabilities now

38
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,170
what do I do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you'll have some</font>

39
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,039
good ideas about how to form a strategy

40
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,270
around that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so vulnerability</font>

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,790
management when we're talking about

42
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,880
vulnerabilities it's some kind of flaw

43
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:57,000
or error that can be exploited to

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">violate the system security policy so</font>

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,100
some examples would be the apache struts

46
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,860
vulnerability that was recently

47
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:08,728
announced<font color="#E5E5E5"> a week or two ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

48
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:11,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a remote code execution one it's</font>

49
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,150
super nasty so if you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> checked</font>

50
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,709
your environment

51
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,170
that one yet I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would highly recommend</font>

52
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,269
doing that right away<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's being</font>

53
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,700
exploited in the wild and it's very easy

54
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:22,079
to exploit<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you definitely want to</font>

55
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,828
check<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one out if you haven't yet</font>

56
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:29,730
heartbleed is an example of an ssl

57
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:33,480
memory leak vulnerability<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pindell is SSL</font>

58
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,849
and TLS block cipher mode padding ghost

59
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,510
is a buffer overflow in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux module</font>

60
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:42,450
there is a certain version of Windows

61
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:45,690
where you can exploit SMB to cause a

62
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,220
denial of service attack telnet being

63
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,579
enabled that's an example of a

64
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:54,389
vulnerability to because telnet

65
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:56,909
transmits in plain text and web

66
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:58,799
application being vulnerable to a sequel

67
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:00,720
injection attack that's also an example

68
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:03,000
we can see you can find vulnerabilities

69
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,099
on the application level the operating

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
system level<font color="#E5E5E5"> or even the firmware level</font>

71
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,619
so when we're talking about

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,549
vulnerabilities we're talking about all

73
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:15,030
these things a vulnerability instance so

74
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:17,699
that means one vulnerability on<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

75
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,220
asset on one port on one application now

76
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:21,810
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I need to define that will</font>

77
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,879
make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit later into the</font>

78
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,489
talk but when we get into metric and

79
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:28,918
communicating the findings to the people

80
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,569
who need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remediate them so say for</font>

81
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,120
example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these two different</font>

82
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:35,458
applications running on your host and

83
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,079
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> both have Java embedded and Java</font>

84
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,790
needs to be updated on both of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

85
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:41,340
applications you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to count</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that as</font>

86
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,828
two vulnerabilities one so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when the</font>

87
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,590
person goes to remediate it for you they

88
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:49,650
know to fix both and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also when you're</font>

89
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">reporting quantity to up to upper-level</font>

90
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">management you're counting that as two</font>

91
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:54,629
findings because they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're two</font>

92
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:58,828
distinct findings that both need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

93
00:03:54,629 --> 00:04:00,239
addressed separately actionable<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we</font>

94
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:03,840
say that we're describing a

95
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,849
vulnerability that has a known<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix so</font>

96
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,220
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> vulnerabilities out there that</font>

97
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:10,108
the vendor has decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to come up</font>

98
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a fix for those wouldn't be</font>

99
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:13,889
actionable and so they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

100
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,579
handled<font color="#E5E5E5"> differently than ones where we</font>

101
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:19,289
can apply a fixed severity that's the

102
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,108
measure of risk resulting from a

103
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:24,690
vulnerability instance typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

104
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:26,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">use critical high medium or low to</font>

105
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,010
describe the

106
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:32,250
severity of a vulnerability but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

107
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:35,610
could also use a numeric<font color="#CCCCCC"> value the CBS s</font>

108
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,440
score is on a scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> of one to ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

109
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero to ten not sure it starts at zero</font>

110
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,250
at one but it's a numeric value<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you</font>

111
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,170
could also use that but typically i

112
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,860
think you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find people are</font>

113
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:49,020
using critical high medium or low risk

114
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,550
management it's the active determining

115
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,950
what threats your organization faces

116
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,230
analyzing your vulnerabilities to assess

117
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:58,380
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> threat level and determining how you</font>

118
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:00,720
will dress the risk so once you've found

119
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,280
all these vulnerabilities you can deal

120
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,850
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> them in three ways you can mitigate</font>

121
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,309
the risk so you fix it you could

122
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:10,050
transfer<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so some ways you could do</font>

123
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,390
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could purchase cyber security</font>

124
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,640
insurance or you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a third</font>

125
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,380
party host the application and they

126
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,960
would be the ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsible if it gets</font>

127
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,060
attacked or you could accept<font color="#CCCCCC"> the risk</font>

128
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,520
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say look it</font>

129
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,040
cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> more to fix the vulnerability then</font>

130
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,900
it does if someone were<font color="#CCCCCC"> to exploit it so</font>

131
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,550
the business decide you know we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

132
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,440
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to accept that risk and that's a</font>

133
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,750
business dishes and that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

134
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,950
your decision as an information<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

135
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:39,720
professional<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think for us the main</font>

136
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:43,469
thing is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we provide the business</font>

137
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,110
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of all the information so that</font>

138
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:49,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">they can make a good solid educated</font>

139
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:52,050
decision about what to do with the risk

140
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,280
and how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle it because at the end</font>

141
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,100
of the day they have that business

142
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,650
context that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't have so they need</font>

143
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,060
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the ones that decide okay where do</font>

144
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,770
we go from there<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we give them all</font>

145
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,190
the you know background knowledge from a

146
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,299
security perspective so the

147
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:10,320
vulnerability management<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifecycle</font>

148
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:13,230
starts with prioritizing your assets so

149
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,700
you need to know what what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

150
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:17,760
support in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> business so for example</font>

151
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:21,120
on if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working at a payment</font>

152
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,460
processing industry like theses and the

153
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,320
businesses to process payment so those

154
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,150
systems that are doing the processing of

155
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">the credit card transactions those are</font>

156
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,530
very most critical assets to the

157
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:34,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">business on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that discovery you know we</font>

158
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:36,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">are broadcasting TV shows so the systems</font>

159
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:38,309
that are actually broadcasting TV shows

160
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,100
those are the absolute most critical

161
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,050
assets

162
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,330
and so you need to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so that</font>

163
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,340
when you prioritize remediation you're

164
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,930
making sure that you're fixing those you

165
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,929
know those prime things that are most

166
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:52,150
important to the business and then

167
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,550
detection so you run your vulnerability

168
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:58,120
scan on and you find the vulnerabilities

169
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,950
then you report them to the stakeholders

170
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,790
and to the parties who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

171
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:05,979
remediating the findings then your sis

172
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,240
admins will remediate them and then

173
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,980
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to come back and</font>

174
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,110
do another scan to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that the</font>

175
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,760
past day or whatever solution they

176
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,500
implemented actually fix the

177
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,520
vulnerability so in the verify stage

178
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,220
they're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go back and</font>

179
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,080
rescan to make sure it worked and you

180
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,420
know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a continuous cycle because</font>

181
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,950
the environments always changing and new

182
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:27,820
vulnerabilities are always being found

183
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:29,229
so this is continuous so the

184
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,770
characteristics of a successful

185
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:34,810
vulnerability management program scope

186
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,490
completeness so you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font>

187
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,630
you find as much as possible you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

188
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,460
make sure you're covering your entire

189
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,110
environment so there's two parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

190
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,570
there's everything in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your environment</font>

191
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,040
which is the network space and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

192
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to make sure you're checking for as</font>

193
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,240
many vulnerabilities as you can check

194
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,430
for so you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure you're</font>

195
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,920
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tool that has plenty of</font>

196
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,720
vulnerability signatures to cover

197
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,720
everything and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other part to</font>

198
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,450
that is authenticated scanning<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus</font>

199
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,400
unauthenticated scanning so if you're

200
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:06,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">running a vulnerability scan and you</font>

201
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,620
don't have authenticated access or you

202
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,690
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agent installed on it then</font>

203
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,400
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> limited visibility into the</font>

204
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,550
asset and therefore you won't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

205
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,590
detect all of the vulnerabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in</font>

206
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,420
order for to get complete<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope you</font>

207
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,099
would want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have credentialed access</font>

208
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,770
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> host whether it be with</font>

209
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,660
credentials through authentication or

210
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:29,380
with an agent installed locally on the

211
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:31,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">host officially integrates with</font>

212
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,820
pre-existing business processes in real

213
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:36,010
time so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's two key words in</font>

214
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that point one is efficiently on your</font>

215
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,640
when you go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start a vulnerability</font>

216
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:41,228
management program there's probably

217
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:45,189
already some kind of patch management

218
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:47,140
program in place hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you</font>

219
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,839
want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know you're</font>

220
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,060
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> with whatever whatever they're</font>

221
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,900
doing already<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of how it relates</font>

222
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,050
to vulnerability

223
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:59,199
management and then and then the real

224
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:01,689
time point when things come up like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

225
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,310
struts vulnerability someone like your

226
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,900
CEO is going to hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that and you</font>

227
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,430
probably not going to be technical he's

228
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,780
just going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be like oh there's</font>

229
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">something really bad I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font>

230
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,949
what's the exposure in the environment

231
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,839
so that mask is going to roll downhill

232
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,400
to you and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to</font>

233
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,080
answer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> question so if you're</font>

234
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">running vulnerability scans on say a</font>

235
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:23,350
weekly basis you can't say let me get

236
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:24,910
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you next week CEO so you need to</font>

237
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> solution is</font>

238
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,380
providing you with that data in real

239
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:32,260
time so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can answer questions</font>

240
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:35,350
like that and the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> is efficient</font>

241
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:37,630
so for vulnerability scanning you can

242
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:40,270
have either an agent solution an

243
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:42,670
agentless solution or a combination of

244
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,530
both so the agent provides that

245
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:47,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">real-time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data that you need the way it</font>

246
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:49,150
works is you installed on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host it</font>

247
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,550
will do it will check<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all the</font>

248
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:53,560
vulnerabilities and then send<font color="#CCCCCC"> that data</font>

249
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,089
back up to if you're using a cloud

250
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,709
solution then it will be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud or</font>

251
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:59,110
wherever that data is being stored it

252
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:01,840
will send that back and then it will

253
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:04,900
only report back when the system changes

254
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,490
so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Delta's the difference between</font>

255
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,720
that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> an agentless solution with an</font>

256
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:11,110
agentless solution you would have a

257
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,550
scanner<font color="#CCCCCC"> and any time you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to look</font>

258
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">for vulnerabilities you'd have to run a</font>

259
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:18,010
scan and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would run through a check of</font>

260
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,780
every single vulnerability so the reason

261
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we can't just use agents because</font>

262
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know like i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said the agents are</font>

263
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:26,140
really beneficial is because

264
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,730
realistically you're not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

265
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">the agent installed on every single</font>

266
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:32,140
asset in your environment and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

267
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,300
there's going to be platforms where the

268
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:38,020
agent won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be compatible like IOT types</font>

269
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,699
of devices but and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

270
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,770
the agents never going to be able to

271
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,420
cover everything so for the parts that

272
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,560
it can't cover<font color="#CCCCCC"> you still want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

273
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,890
that scanner you still want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

274
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,800
scanning your entire subnet space and

275
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,240
you also want to identify rogue asus you

276
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,430
know if someone plug something into your

277
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">network and you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just relying on</font>

278
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,150
wherever the agent is installed then you

279
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,470
wouldn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it unless you were</font>

280
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:04,480
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> a scan of the whole network</font>

281
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:06,170
space measurable progress so you need a

282
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,149
way to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

283
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,560
you're you're making improvements that

284
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:12,200
you're reducing risk to the environment

285
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,449
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can get really complicated as</font>

286
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,880
you'll see in later slides when you have

287
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,110
all this data to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show that</font>

288
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,420
because there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font>

289
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">things going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on and you're going to get</font>

290
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,469
asked questions that may seem really

291
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:27,440
simple like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh you know are we doing</font>

292
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:29,060
better are we meeting things faster they

293
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,010
seem like<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple reasonable questions</font>

294
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,800
but when it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to it there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are so</font>

295
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:37,279
many factors on that affect what's going

296
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,260
on as I'll describe later you just need

297
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,070
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that you can</font>

298
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:44,870
communicate that correctly and your

299
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,880
program should be audit proof so

300
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,649
depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what organization you're at</font>

301
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,350
you may or may not have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

302
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:55,220
compliance policies that you're forced

303
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:56,839
to abide by so comparing my current

304
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,899
organization to my last one so going

305
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:03,170
from the payments industry to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the TV</font>

306
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:05,120
broadcasting media industry there were

307
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,969
far more audit requirements in the

308
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">payment industry definitely had to talk</font>

309
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,709
to auditors i would say at least once

310
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:14,959
every other week on they were always

311
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:16,849
coming to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask questions you know about</font>

312
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,199
how we were doing things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the data we</font>

313
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:21,140
are collecting and everything like that

314
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:23,149
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you are</font>

315
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,800
somewhere like where I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> now in the</font>

316
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:26,959
media industry where we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have so</font>

317
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,760
many compliance regulations we need to

318
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,250
abide by it's still good to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

319
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,350
program in a way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> justify</font>

320
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:36,620
you know that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your processes</font>

321
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:38,360
down you're following them and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

322
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,540
its automated so there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

323
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,850
room for human error so that's just best

324
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:46,819
practices way to design it whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

325
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:49,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">not you have to answer to auditors so</font>

326
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:52,190
the stakeholders in this process you

327
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:55,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">have executive leadership now depending</font>

328
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the organization again like sometimes</font>

329
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:59,149
this goes all the way up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board of</font>

330
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:02,089
directors and other organizations you

331
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:04,940
know it stops the sea so maybe so

332
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:06,410
depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you know where it is there</font>

333
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,089
some leadership though that's coming

334
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,170
down and they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you know the</font>

335
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:10,699
risk in the environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,889
vulnerabilities in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment in</font>

337
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:14,420
this audience is not technical you

338
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:16,490
basically want to be able to communicate

339
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">to them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what does this mean for</font>

340
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:21,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">them to the to the business</font>

341
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,350
you ever system owners those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

342
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:26,020
people who have to make the<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision</font>

343
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,580
about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to address the risk they own</font>

344
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,699
the system they know what it's used for

345
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:33,190
they're responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> signing off on</font>

346
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,450
the vulnerabilities or you know if

347
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,310
there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an exception for</font>

348
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,920
them or making sure that they have

349
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:42,969
resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> dedicated to or mediating them</font>

350
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:45,370
your information security team they run

351
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,590
the vulnerability scans and manage the

352
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:50,350
data that comes out of that then you

353
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:52,690
have your auditors and system

354
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,830
administrator so system administrators

355
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:59,380
are the ones doing the actual

356
00:13:53,830 --> 00:14:01,090
remediation so the components<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this</font>

357
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">program you have your vulnerability</font>

358
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,290
scanner and then you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> at some kind</font>

359
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,170
of back-end database where you take that

360
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:10,449
scan data you keep it there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you</font>

361
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:13,780
also take your network inventory your

362
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:15,760
asset inventory in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CMDB and then the</font>

363
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,350
ticketing data for the vulnerability

364
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,600
tickets that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you issue to get the</font>

365
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,040
remediation accomplished you want to

366
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,800
store<font color="#CCCCCC"> all that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in your back-end database</font>

367
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,170
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can produce these detailed</font>

368
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,740
reports and give context to this

369
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:31,750
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> your front-end dashboard</font>

370
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,240
there's two purposes for that one is the

371
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:37,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">metrics so you want to provide some good</font>

372
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,000
charts on there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then workflow so</font>

373
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:41,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">ideally what I'm about to show you is</font>

374
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,110
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be like a one-stop shop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

375
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:47,110
everybody that's involved in the entire

376
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:50,050
vulnerability management process with

377
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:58,630
the end goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> being efficiency oh sure do</font>

378
00:14:50,050 --> 00:15:00,819
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question yes and so that's why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we on</font>

379
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,350
so for scanning purposes you want to

380
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,880
scan<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the subnets usually there's</font>

381
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,790
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of subnet inventory like</font>

382
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">Infoblox or some other type of tool</font>

383
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:12,819
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you at least know your IP address</font>

384
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,740
space and then that's that's what you

385
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,930
base your scope of scanning off of but

386
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,580
then if you have some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of asset</font>

387
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,739
inventory that gives you details like

388
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay who's responsible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for this asset</font>

389
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,980
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you know how to assign the</font>

390
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:26,050
vulnerability tickets you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also how</font>

391
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,510
critical is this asset is it you know in

392
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">your top critical environment and</font>

393
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,810
therefore any vulnerabilities on it

394
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:35,050
should be prioritized

395
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:36,819
that is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cmdb on and</font>

396
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">ideally you know you want to encourage</font>

397
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,410
them to update<font color="#CCCCCC"> cmdb with this</font>

398
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,720
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only helps you</font>

399
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,100
but from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a scanning perspective you</font>

400
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,130
could create your own asset inventory

401
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:51,850
but again<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing that that doesn't</font>

402
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:54,760
provide is the business context so does

403
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:59,560
that answer your question<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thanks um</font>

404
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:01,060
then the ticketing system so again

405
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,069
that's the other piece on that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

406
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,920
your vulnerability tickets so I would

407
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:08,320
recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> when choosing the ticketing</font>

408
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,120
system to use for these you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

409
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,880
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use whatever your support groups</font>

410
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,100
are already using a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times their</font>

411
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,990
performance and metrics are all based

412
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,570
off of tickets that they work on and

413
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:22,270
close and so it's just like added

414
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,680
incentive for them to actually on you

415
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:28,180
know complete your request if you

416
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,099
utilize their ticketing system so the

417
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,500
architecture on a high level so the

418
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,820
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm keeping this high level is</font>

419
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,100
because there are a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways you</font>

420
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,950
can implement this you could build your

421
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">own back-end database yourself and use</font>

422
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:43,390
some kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> front-end solution like</font>

423
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,160
tableau or and there's any number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

424
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:47,080
solutions or there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some solutions</font>

425
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,339
where this is all bundled together like

426
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,870
RSA archers product so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason I'm</font>

427
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:54,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to keep this high level is that</font>

428
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,600
you need to determine what's best for

429
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:58,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">your organization there's a lot of</font>

430
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,370
considerations that need to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

431
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,290
deciding how to architect this and

432
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,750
there's pros and cons for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

433
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:06,970
solutions so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to paint the</font>

434
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,740
picture on a high level on where you

435
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,540
want to go and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know for your</font>

436
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,910
individual organization you figure out

437
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:16,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly what's the best way to architect</font>

438
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:18,610
this so we have the vulnerability

439
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:21,189
scanner the network inventory the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CMDB</font>

440
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:24,219
and the ticketing system all talking

441
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:27,579
back and forth to the database<font color="#E5E5E5"> so these</font>

442
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,990
arrows go both ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you know you</font>

443
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,149
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grab all that information from</font>

444
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,679
those sources but then also you want

445
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,020
your users when I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

446
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:37,750
workflow to go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the front-end</font>

447
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:41,500
dashboard and you know for example

448
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,880
update<font color="#E5E5E5"> something in the ticket they fix</font>

449
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,570
the vulnerability they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> close it</font>

450
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,519
or

451
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,889
they want to wreak it off a scan to make

452
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure that their remediation worked so</font>

453
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:51,610
they you know click a button and that

454
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,408
tells the vulnerability scanner kick off

455
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:58,508
another scan and let me know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it</font>

456
00:17:53,409 --> 00:18:00,190
worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is an example of</font>

457
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:01,870
what your back-end database might look

458
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,789
like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to get into every</font>

459
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:06,549
pieces data that's here because that

460
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:08,649
would take too long<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this is an</font>

461
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:12,070
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to kind of show you what</font>

462
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:14,979
we're storing in here up<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the top left</font>

463
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:19,269
corner<font color="#CCCCCC"> infoblox that would be your on</font>

464
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:21,700
subnet inventory as you can see this is

465
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:24,759
that's one challenge in itself because

466
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're storing a list of subnets you</font>

467
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:28,600
want to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to compare</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to each</font>

468
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,029
individual IP address that comes back

469
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,009
from your vulnerability scanner so

470
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:35,080
discovered host table underneath that

471
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:37,629
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a list of hosts that your</font>

472
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,269
vulnerability scanner discovered so

473
00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:42,399
mathematically you know it's doable to

474
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:44,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">say okay you have this given IP address</font>

475
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:47,529
what subnet does it belong to or does it

476
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,990
belong to you know a subnet in your info

477
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:52,450
box table but from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a database</font>

478
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:54,730
perspective you have to do some

479
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:58,539
engineering there too to make that join

480
00:18:54,730 --> 00:19:01,179
and as you can see I have some various

481
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:03,370
history tables on the purpose of that is

482
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:05,529
that the leadership definitely loves to

483
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,508
hear about trending you<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely want</font>

484
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:11,350
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> include trending reports and your</font>

485
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:13,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">front-end dashboard for them because</font>

486
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,158
they love to see things over<font color="#E5E5E5"> time it's</font>

487
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:17,230
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big challenge though</font>

488
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:19,059
because things change so much and like I

489
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,679
said they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions well</font>

490
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:22,269
why does you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of</font>

491
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:25,389
vulnerabilities go up this one month

492
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:28,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay like I'm managing 80,000 assets and</font>

493
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:29,949
you know I dozens and dozens of

494
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:31,269
vulnerabilities come out every week you

495
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:35,860
know you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

496
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:39,669
answer those questions but anyway so

497
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:41,709
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> front-end dashboard ideally you</font>

498
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:44,289
would want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a different page for</font>

499
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:46,000
each of your stakeholder groups so think

500
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:48,639
of your stakeholders like<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a role</font>

501
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,950
for each of one of those so when the CTO

502
00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:54,010
logs in he should<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be seen the same</font>

503
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:56,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing as a sysadmin on you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the CTO</font>

504
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,340
just wants to see charts and big picture

505
00:19:56,379 --> 00:19:59,620
ideas

506
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,389
whereas somebody who's doing remediation

507
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:04,179
is going to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see you know these</font>

508
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:06,400
itemized listed out details so they can

509
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:09,340
click in and they can say okay like I

510
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,500
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix this now or you know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

511
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,060
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy this to however</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many hosts and</font>

512
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,650
this is all the information this is

513
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:20,139
where I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can find them their IP address</font>

514
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:23,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">hostname</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> etc so the process is involved</font>

515
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:27,670
in vulnerability scanning rating the

516
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:30,190
vulnerabilities so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go into</font>

517
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:31,840
detail of all these processes so I guess

518
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:35,320
I'll just list them out now and then

519
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into detail after this then</font>

520
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,310
you have remediation so you can either

521
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,050
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have your patch management</font>

522
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:44,260
process and your configuration

523
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:48,190
management process asset decommissioning

524
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:49,900
false positives exceptions and there's

525
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,070
two types of exceptions there is the

526
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,660
exception where they're going to accept

527
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:55,750
the risk for vulnerability and decide

528
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:57,430
not to fix it or sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't</font>

529
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,520
want to scan certain assets on the

530
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:02,710
network because typically like IOT

531
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,510
devices and non-standard platforms don't

532
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:07,000
play well with vulnerability scanners

533
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,890
they weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant to handle normal</font>

534
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,780
internet traffic and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

535
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:14,140
vulnerability scans are supposed to be

536
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:17,139
passive are not but they're not intended

537
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:20,020
to be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen test type of activities</font>

538
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:22,450
or offensive type activities that are

539
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,730
supposed to cause any harm or anything

540
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:27,310
to the system so if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does happen</font>

541
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:30,430
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really because it's some kind of</font>

542
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:32,590
non-standard platform that was not made

543
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:35,890
to handle regular traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font>

544
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:37,959
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> all over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet handling</font>

545
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:40,450
findings that have no fix available<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

546
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,870
another process and you have audit and

547
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:45,640
then continuous scope maintenance so

548
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:49,419
when we're talking about vulnerability

549
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,710
severity rating there's there's multiple

550
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,400
things you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take into account</font>

551
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:56,200
here so asset criticality again you can

552
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,140
rank<font color="#E5E5E5"> them on your critical environment</font>

553
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,790
and then ideally if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get</font>

554
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,740
really advanced you could have

555
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,530
confidentiality integrity and

556
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,930
availability ratings for each of the

557
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:10,030
hosts so how important<font color="#E5E5E5"> are each of those</font>

558
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,570
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> on each host and you weigh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

559
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:13,330
in

560
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:16,600
do your criticality score then you can

561
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:19,178
use CBS s<font color="#E5E5E5"> score as part of that rating</font>

562
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,129
and then any mitigating controls you

563
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:22,899
have in your environment so say for

564
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:25,840
example you have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of web app</font>

565
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:27,850
vulnerability but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you also have a</font>

566
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,939
wasp implemented that's going to block

567
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:34,299
any attack on that vulnerability that

568
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:36,429
may cause you to you know p prioritize

569
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:39,190
or decrease the<font color="#E5E5E5"> severity of that</font>

570
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:40,269
particular vulnerability at the end of

571
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,009
the day you still<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to fix your</font>

572
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:45,220
vulnerabilities even if you have that

573
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:46,659
added layer of protection an attacker is

574
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,899
eventually going to get around something

575
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:56,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a laugh but at least that will slow</font>

576
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:58,959
them down so it helps but yeah so for

577
00:22:56,259 --> 00:23:06,429
remediation this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be your</font>

578
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:08,139
assistant offensive just chosen for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

579
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:10,779
sake of having example I've chosen this

580
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:12,939
one Microsoft catch<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so your sis</font>

581
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:15,519
admins like okay Patch Tuesday happened

582
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,980
it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me to go update the</font>

583
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">Windows host with this patch so you give</font>

584
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,870
him the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it well okay he goes</font>

585
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:25,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">into your um your front-end dashboard</font>

586
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:27,158
and looks up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what are all the hosts</font>

587
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:30,820
that need this patch still have some

588
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:33,220
kind of search box like that and then

589
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,899
what could happen he might determine

590
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,629
that it's a false positive you might go

591
00:23:34,899 --> 00:23:39,789
to apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> that update to one of the</font>

592
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:43,509
windows<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosts and i'll say this update</font>

593
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:44,740
is not applicable to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

594
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:47,470
so then he would<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow the false</font>

595
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">positive process and we'll get into what</font>

596
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:51,490
that entails in a minute but today it's

597
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:54,279
not false positives in the next step is

598
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:56,169
deploy affixed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the development</font>

599
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:57,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">environment right because you want to</font>

600
00:23:56,169 --> 00:24:03,220
test the fix and development before

601
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:04,750
deploying to production so ideally if

602
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,389
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you have your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> front-end</font>

603
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:09,250
dashboard talking to whatever tool they

604
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:11,019
use to for their patch management

605
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:13,840
process like they might have something

606
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:15,879
like big fix to deploy patches if he can

607
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,289
if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sysadmin can go into your</font>

608
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:19,389
front-end dashboard he can see all the

609
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:21,610
hosts that he needs to update and then

610
00:24:19,389 --> 00:24:23,559
he can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just highlight them and then that</font>

611
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:24,100
sends off a<font color="#E5E5E5"> message to big fix or</font>

612
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:26,470
whatever the

613
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:29,199
well is to go to ploy the patch that's a

614
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:31,030
really efficient process so at the end

615
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the day that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of fishin see</font>

616
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:37,030
we're talking about and then after that

617
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:39,939
he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

618
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:42,160
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fixed actually remediated the</font>

619
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:44,559
problem so he would just go right back

620
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,870
into the dashboard kick off a scan on

621
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,370
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosts or if they have the agent</font>

622
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:51,549
installed and there's not even a need to

623
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:53,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">kick off another skin and search on them</font>

624
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:58,210
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that they're now showing us</font>

625
00:24:53,140 --> 00:25:01,030
six if there's any problem that goes on

626
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,559
with that testing say the update broke

627
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,928
some application that was running<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

628
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">host then you would want to go to the</font>

629
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:11,500
exceptions process file for an<font color="#E5E5E5"> exception</font>

630
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:13,510
for that vulnerability<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so after</font>

631
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,970
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the six if everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was good</font>

632
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:18,640
then you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy to QA in</font>

633
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:22,360
production environments and then after

634
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to rescan again or refresh</font>

635
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:28,479
if you're using agents and close all the

636
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:31,870
tickets associated with the finding the

637
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,390
asset decommissioning process so the

638
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:36,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">challenge with what happens when assets</font>

639
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:38,140
are decommissioned a vulnerability only

640
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:40,449
gets marked as fixed when the scanner

641
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:42,549
can confirm that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has been fixed so if</font>

642
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:45,130
you take something also network then

643
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:46,389
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming back so technically the</font>

644
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:48,610
vulnerability is gone you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

645
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:50,980
consider it fixed but you have no way of

646
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,389
knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know those just didn't</font>

647
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,250
happen to be powered<font color="#CCCCCC"> down when you were</font>

648
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,950
scanning it or what you don't know if

649
00:25:54,250 --> 00:26:01,750
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming back on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the network so the</font>

650
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:03,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">way we've handled this is we if we</font>

651
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,049
haven't seen the host in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past 30</font>

652
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,580
days so in other words that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scanner</font>

653
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:08,679
hasn't seen it if the agent hasn't

654
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,539
checked in in 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> days then we consider</font>

655
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:12,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">that ok that's decommissioned that's off</font>

656
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:15,070
the wire we're going to mark you know

657
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:16,840
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those findings as fixed now the</font>

658
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:19,030
people who are doing the remediation

659
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:22,000
they don't want to wait 30 days to get

660
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:24,070
the credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> for fixing it so on the a</font>

661
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,610
solution we gave them is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok then go into</font>

662
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:30,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">cmdb mark the asset as decommissioned</font>

663
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:32,229
and then for those assets we'll just

664
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,850
give it a seven day window to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

665
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,919
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also wired for those ones</font>

666
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,389
after seven days then we'll consider it

667
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,580
fixed

668
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:43,230
false<font color="#CCCCCC"> positive so sometimes there are</font>

669
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,090
going to be cases where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you</font>

670
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:46,530
have false positives there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

671
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,600
really great scanning tools out there

672
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:51,180
and technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really minimize</font>

673
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,790
false positives<font color="#E5E5E5"> so hopefully</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you won't</font>

674
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:55,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to deal with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this much but um you</font>

675
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:58,889
know nothing's perfect so at some point

676
00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:00,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">you probably will so what begins this</font>

677
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:03,090
process is the host that you've been

678
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">given that need remediation you've</font>

679
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:06,959
determined that the fix has already been

680
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,540
applied<font color="#E5E5E5"> or it's not applicable to the</font>

681
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology so what you want to do is you</font>

682
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take some screenshots well if</font>

683
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,520
you're the system administrator then you

684
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:16,320
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take some screenshots showing</font>

685
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,510
the evidence like hey this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

686
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,879
applicable or look I already fix this

687
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:22,080
but it's still showing up as active and

688
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,410
you send<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the vulnerability</font>

689
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,689
management team and then we'll review it

690
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:30,030
and then if we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that's</font>

691
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:34,440
correct then we're going to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font>

692
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:35,610
the vendor and<font color="#CCCCCC"> have them fix it so but</font>

693
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">you also want to track that in your</font>

694
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:38,909
metric because again people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

695
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">get mad if you're saying you have these</font>

696
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:43,170
vulnerabilities but it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

697
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:45,480
false positive so you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

698
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:48,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">front end database and Mark those is</font>

699
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:51,120
false positive in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case then the</font>

700
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:52,860
vendor hopefully eventually fixes the

701
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,649
vulnerability signature for you so that

702
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:57,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">going forward it correctly you know</font>

703
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:00,720
identifies the vulnerability and there's

704
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:02,700
no more false positive then the vm team

705
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,680
verifies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendor fixed it</font>

706
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,450
correctly and then goes back into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

707
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:10,710
database<font color="#E5E5E5"> and takes away the false</font>

708
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:12,690
positive designation so here's a some

709
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,400
detailed examples of how a false

710
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:17,220
positive can happen so these are

711
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:20,610
actually real examples that my team came

712
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,990
across last year and this is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

713
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,370
the both of these we're on the same host

714
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:26,610
so that's why you see that the

715
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:29,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">timestamps are the same so the first one</font>

716
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:32,760
is an unchecked buffer<font color="#CCCCCC"> in directx</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

717
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,870
could enable system compromised so this

718
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,210
came back from a little bit of

719
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:37,860
vulnerability scanner what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

720
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:39,720
want to check first in these cases when

721
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,459
your sis admin says this is a false

722
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,430
positive the first thing you always want

723
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">to check</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the date on cuz a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

724
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:48,750
times it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just as simple as they're</font>

725
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,100
looking at data that's old so again if

726
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:53,520
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the agent installed and that's</font>

727
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:57,540
a non-issue then we see the operating

728
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,550
system is windows 10 and the results so

729
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:01,170
what the results tell you is it gives

730
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:03,960
you some insight<font color="#CCCCCC"> into how the signature</font>

731
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:07,470
is working so<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this case the signature</font>

732
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,300
is checking this Court's dll file

733
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:11,370
version and that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's determining</font>

734
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:15,419
whether or not the system is vulnerable

735
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:17,399
and needs this<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows update so some</font>

736
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,230
sysadmin you know reported this to us as

737
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:23,160
a false positive so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

738
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:25,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">knowledge base article in on microsoft</font>

739
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:28,020
site about this patch and we can see

740
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the affected software list Windows</font>

741
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 isn't on that list it's not</font>

742
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,960
applicable so they were correct so we

743
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:36,870
had to report that to the vendor and

744
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:40,590
they fixed it for us this other example

745
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:42,149
is a dotnet framework on collection of

746
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:47,610
vulnerabilities that are addressed by

747
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:49,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">this update ms 1519 so you can see in</font>

748
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:52,649
the results that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> checking for the</font>

749
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:56,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">version of this system deployment dll</font>

750
00:29:52,650 --> 00:30:01,470
file but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again we see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's only</font>

751
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:04,680
applicable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows 2008 or vista and</font>

752
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:07,860
we're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Windows 10 host so it's</font>

753
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:09,360
not applicable so one thing one thing to

754
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,250
note though about the operating system

755
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,990
version that comes back if you're

756
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:16,050
running a scan that's not authenticated

757
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:18,480
or is not with the agent then it's the

758
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:20,669
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the best guest effort so it's</font>

759
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,890
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you run an nmap scan and you can</font>

760
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:25,290
fingerprint the operating system

761
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:28,080
basically with an often unauthenticated

762
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:30,629
scan that's what it's doing so it's not

763
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">always a hundred percent accurate but if</font>

764
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:34,200
you do have authenticated or agent

765
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:40,200
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it should be accurate all the</font>

766
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:43,260
time exceptions process ok so the patch

767
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:46,410
or configuration change was not you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

768
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:49,350
driving<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the software applications</font>

769
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:50,880
that you're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the host or some</font>

770
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:53,939
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that so you need to file an</font>

771
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,000
exception request this is admin can go

772
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:59,070
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your front-end dashboard and put in</font>

773
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,650
all the details<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it how long they</font>

774
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:02,550
want it to be for and everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

775
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,920
you're going to store all this

776
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:08,850
information in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> backend database once</font>

777
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:11,820
they put it in be on in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front end so</font>

778
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:14,520
but then the exception request goes for

779
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,260
approval or or being denied by

780
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,930
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> security team</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and all the</font>

781
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:21,420
stakeholders and then finally the

782
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:24,570
vulnerability findings in your database

783
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:25,530
are designated as under exceptions so

784
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,570
that's something you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to communicate</font>

785
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:31,470
when you're creating your dashboards and

786
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:35,610
reports for management so then you have

787
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:37,560
findings that have no fix available you

788
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:39,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">should report these to the architecture</font>

789
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,129
team because then they can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

790
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:42,960
mitigating controls so just because

791
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,700
there's no fix to it doesn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

792
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,320
there's not something else you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do to</font>

793
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,540
reduce the likelihood that someone's

794
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to exploit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the vulnerability so</font>

795
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,860
that's the purpose of providing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

796
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:58,290
report to the architecture team on a

797
00:31:52,860 --> 00:32:03,389
regular basis yeah so that's pretty much

798
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:04,350
overview of that process so audit the

799
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:06,660
things that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask about</font>

800
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:09,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the most are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scoped again making sure</font>

801
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:11,970
you have completeness that what are your

802
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:14,939
SLA so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a timeline for</font>

803
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:16,800
how quickly the admins need to remediate

804
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:19,140
your findings usually it's something

805
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:22,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">like okay critical findings have to be</font>

806
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:25,380
remediated in a week and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

807
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:27,719
medium low are 30 60 90 days something

808
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:29,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that so audits going to want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

809
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,680
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sysadmin meeting those SLA</font>

810
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:35,940
s and so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

811
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:38,250
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run reports showing that so in</font>

812
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:41,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">general just a tip for handling auditors</font>

813
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:43,350
on you should ask them for the test

814
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:45,990
cases ahead of time and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

815
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:48,659
you go run<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reports for them you can</font>

816
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:51,510
get down a long rabbit hole if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you show</font>

817
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:52,650
your you know your tools to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the auditors</font>

818
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,180
because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to ask a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

819
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:56,190
of questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say well what</font>

820
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:58,080
about this what about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you could</font>

821
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,370
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them forever so that's just a</font>

822
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,330
little tip for handling auditors

823
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:05,100
continuous scope maintenance so again

824
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:07,260
the environment is always changing new

825
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:09,149
servers are coming on servers are being

826
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:12,270
decommissioned new vulnerabilities are

827
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:14,100
coming up new applications so that's

828
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:15,149
something you always have to keep

829
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,468
current

830
00:33:15,149 --> 00:33:18,359
so you want to make sure you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font>

831
00:33:16,469 --> 00:33:20,099
having authenticated access to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host</font>

832
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:21,749
whether it's through credentials or

833
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:24,658
agents so you want to have a dashboard

834
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:26,099
for yourself in your interface that's

835
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:31,649
going to show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the some</font>

836
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:33,239
authentication reports metrics so some

837
00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:35,339
of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to report on the</font>

838
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:37,830
dashboard how much risk exists<font color="#E5E5E5"> now so</font>

839
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:39,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a question like CTO and</font>

840
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:41,968
leadership above that level are going to

841
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:43,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to know so one of the ways you can</font>

842
00:33:41,969 --> 00:33:45,539
show this is what are all my

843
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:49,139
vulnerability instances by severity

844
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:50,729
region and support group<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then what</font>

845
00:33:49,139 --> 00:33:52,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">are the top ten support groups and</font>

846
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:55,679
technologies with actionable

847
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:57,749
vulnerability instances information<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

848
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,549
that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually also influence what</font>

849
00:33:57,749 --> 00:34:01,889
kind of technology the organization

850
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:04,109
decides to deploy because say for

851
00:34:01,889 --> 00:34:05,939
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know Java is one of those</font>

852
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:07,379
technologies that constantly has

853
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,899
vulnerabilities constantly needs

854
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:13,348
updating so if it's costing you know

855
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:16,379
their admin X number of hours to to

856
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:17,940
always keep patching Java then the

857
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:19,469
business might say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay maybe we need to</font>

858
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:22,679
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a different technology to meet</font>

859
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:26,129
the solution so how well are we managing

860
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:28,889
risk so I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say the best way to show</font>

861
00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:30,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is the Delta between the fix</font>

862
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:32,220
vulnerabilities and the new

863
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,770
vulnerabilities because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font>

864
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:35,969
constant pace like how quickly new

865
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:38,309
vulnerabilities are going to be

866
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:40,288
identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can't simply say okay</font>

867
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:42,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know we fix this many we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

868
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:44,549
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like how how quickly we're closing</font>

869
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:46,918
that gap between the new ones and how

870
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:48,690
quickly we're fixing them so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

871
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,690
show a report of fixed vulnerability

872
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:54,119
instances by date severity and SLA

873
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:57,510
status they fixed it but did they fix it

874
00:34:54,119 --> 00:35:01,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">on time then new vulnerability instances</font>

875
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:04,140
by severity so upcoming workload this is

876
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:06,059
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your operations team will</font>

877
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:08,520
want to know it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> information for</font>

878
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:11,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">them if you're like okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows</font>

879
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:14,190
findings in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next four weeks there's</font>

880
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:16,950
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be you know 20,000 of them do</font>

881
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:18,450
so then then the leaders of that team

882
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:20,220
are going to know oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> my windows team is</font>

883
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:23,399
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be busy coming up they're going</font>

884
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:25,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a lot on their hands trending</font>

885
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,730
data again leadership loves trending

886
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,460
they want to know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody's doing</font>

887
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,780
how you know this

888
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:33,290
or you have to tell the story<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

889
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:36,290
beginning to end on the data integrity

890
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:38,390
so again going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the authenticated</font>

891
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:41,300
scanning<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus unauthenticated scanning</font>

892
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:43,190
if you don't have authentication if

893
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:46,609
something doesn't work then you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

894
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:52,400
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> limited in the signatures that you</font>

895
00:35:46,609 --> 00:35:54,950
can check<font color="#CCCCCC"> for so we started out with our</font>

896
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,960
cyber information center connecting into

897
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:59,779
our vulnerability scanner network

898
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,810
inventory<font color="#E5E5E5"> cmdb in the ticketing system</font>

899
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:05,330
taking this all step further we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

900
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:10,130
connect into all these other areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

901
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:15,200
involve security to show a real complete

902
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:17,930
risk you know description to marcy p 0

903
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,480
or you know whatever other stakeholders

904
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:22,790
are interested so we can hook<font color="#E5E5E5"> them into</font>

905
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,010
the patch deployment tool again that

906
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:26,869
makes it quicker for I office admin to

907
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:30,380
go and see the vulnerability you know

908
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:32,839
and remediate it<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-stop-shop the pen</font>

909
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,640
test findings so sometimes your pen

910
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:36,140
tester will come in and they'll find

911
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,960
some of the same findings that your

912
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:40,759
vulnerability scanner found this admins

913
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,800
get cranky when they see multiple

914
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,240
tickets for the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> or like you</font>

915
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we saw it from vulnerability</font>

916
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,089
scanner and now I'm seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from your</font>

917
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,160
pen tester you don't need to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

918
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:50,839
twice<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so if we get all that</font>

919
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,060
integrated into the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> back-end</font>

920
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:55,790
database and you know we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just report</font>

921
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:57,560
it to them once your baseline

922
00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:00,980
configuration scanner it's good to have

923
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:03,589
that data into so that you're tracking

924
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:05,839
you know what configuration changes need

925
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:08,810
to be made what bass lines were created

926
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:13,400
correctly according to your policies etc

927
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:16,279
audit findings your threat intelligence

928
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,650
platform that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool if you can</font>

929
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,619
integrate prioritizing vulnerability

930
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:25,910
remediation on threat intelligence so

931
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:29,330
say this particular like<font color="#CCCCCC"> haxor act sorry</font>

932
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:31,098
on hacker group comes out and there you

933
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:33,440
know targeting this one particular

934
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:34,790
vulnerability then you probably want to

935
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,410
increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> the severity of that</font>

936
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:38,029
vulnerability so if you have a threat

937
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:41,060
intelligence platform that you can hook

938
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:42,090
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that data integrated into</font>

939
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,400
your so there

940
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:47,400
d rating then that's definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a value</font>

941
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,350
add and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the other area is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

942
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,120
security architecture because<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that</font>

943
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:53,040
can tell you is mitigating controls

944
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,200
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have mitigating controls in</font>

945
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,190
place that could be a reason to decrease

946
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,649
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> severity of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a finding so some of the</font>

947
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:04,740
challenges<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may face in vulnerability</font>

948
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:07,350
management these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just some various</font>

949
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:10,350
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've come across working in</font>

950
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:13,110
this area<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for example identifying the</font>

951
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:14,430
local path to ssl certificates your

952
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:17,160
scanner is going to go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and it</font>

953
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:19,529
can see the ssl certificate information

954
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,960
from the outside so if it's an expired

955
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:24,120
certificate or if it's invalid or if

956
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's self signed all those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things are</font>

957
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,650
vulnerabilities but if it's detecting

958
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">that from the outside it's not going to</font>

959
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:32,010
be able to tell you where that

960
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:34,800
certificate lives locally on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host</font>

961
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,660
and your sis admin might not know for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

962
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,430
particular host and so they're like

963
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:40,140
weird where do I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the certificate I</font>

964
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:42,660
know it's on the toast but I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

965
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:45,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and your vulnerability scan doesn't</font>

966
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:48,000
tell you that either so on that's that's

967
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,290
just one challenge I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stan</font>

968
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,150
results being delivered through a load

969
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:53,610
balancer so if you're using a scanner to

970
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:54,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">scan your sending</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that traffic through</font>

971
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:57,120
the load balancer and then when the

972
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:58,680
results come back they're coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

973
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,080
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the load balancer so you don't</font>

974
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:03,720
know what host on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind the load</font>

975
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,310
balancer it's actually talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about but</font>

976
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:09,209
again how many agent installed would

977
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:11,520
avoid that problem determining when new

978
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:14,850
firewall rules are needed for allowing

979
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,320
scanner access to subnets so if you

980
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:20,520
can't see it<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know it exists</font>

981
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:22,590
assets that react adversely to scans I

982
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:26,460
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that earlier like I OT type</font>

983
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:29,280
devices industrial control systems like

984
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,290
your HVAC your power supply all these

985
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">types of things that weren't really</font>

986
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:38,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">created with the thought of normal</font>

987
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:41,580

988
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:44,430
security tools on assets due to high<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU</font>

989
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:46,950
usage on security tools get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad rap</font>

990
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:48,149
about being CPU hogs they're like you

991
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:50,700
know you're running all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things on</font>

992
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:52,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">my host you're making it slow so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

993
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:55,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">get some pushback from the technology</font>

994
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:57,870
team if you ask them to install an agent

995
00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:02,310
one more security agent on their<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosts</font>

996
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:04,440
managing and secured securing service

997
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:06,960
accounts used for scanning so if you're

998
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,300
using credentials instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the agent</font>

999
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,500
then you know things are going to come

00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">host they're going to come online</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

also in a privileged account that has

1005
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,120
access to a lot of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosts in</font>

1006
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,710
your environment so you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

1007
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:29,310
sure you secure those credentials to

1008

in-house development versus using a cot

1009
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:35,940
solution for your whole cyber

1010
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:38,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">Information Center so again it depends</font>

1011
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:41,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">on your organization I personally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> prefer</font>

1012
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:43,560
developing it myself I used to be a DBA

1013
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:45,780
so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> too hard for me to go create</font>

1014
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:47,670
a database and you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed</font>

1015
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:49,560
you in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> database diagram before and</font>

1016
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:51,240
make the API calls to all these

1017
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">different sources and get it student</font>

1018
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,379
myself I like doing that because then I

1019
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:57,540
can design it based on how i know i need

1020
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,730
it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work I don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be confined</font>

1021
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the requirements of a cot solution</font>

1022
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:04,230
but you're not always going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1023
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:06,990
resource who can build that for you

1024
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:08,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">themselves so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes you have to go</font>

1025
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:11,009
with a cop solution or maybe your

1026
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:13,170
company you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> already has licenses</font>

1027
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:16,650
for that solution there's all these

1028
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:21,840
considerations that go into how you want

1029
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:23,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to build this so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take aways build your</font>

1030
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:26,040
technology based on the business rules

1031
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,680
and processes not the other way around

1032
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:31,200
don't get confined to the limitations<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1033
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:34,049
the technology that you use for the

1034
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">program define and document your</font>

1035
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:38,310
business rules including roles and

1036
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:41,130
responsibilities caveats limitations

1037
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:43,080
dependencies especially this whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> cmdb</font>

1038
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:45,720
aspect you know if that's a manual

1039
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:48,210
source of data then you can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

1040
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,009
that as the source you trust for the

1041
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:52,020
complete inventory because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1042
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:54,150
manual and you know as we said before

1043
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:58,020
it's rare to find an organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

1044
00:41:54,150 --> 00:42:00,210
has a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> cmdb that's kept accurate and</font>

1045
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:01,440
devil's bargain so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think what you're</font>

1046
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:02,820
going to find especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're</font>

1047
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,270
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vulnerability management</font>

1048
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:08,100
program started like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said in the</font>

1049
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,110
beginning you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be handed over a</font>

1050
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,299
million vulnerable

1051
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:13,880
these and operations team is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1052
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:17,270
like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the resources to fix</font>

1053
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:19,400
all these on and so what I've seen

1054
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:22,009
happen before is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sea so we'll make</font>

1055
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:24,890
bargains with them like<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well work</font>

1056
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:28,370
will extend your SLA on you know these

1057
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:29,870
findings for this amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time and so</font>

1058
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:31,700
then when you're responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1059
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:33,980
creating metrics and telling the story

1060
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:36,919
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember that all those</font>

1061
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:38,810
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen and so it can be really it</font>

1062
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,850
complicated to keep up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> all those</font>

1063
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:42,440
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have to document it well</font>

1064
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:44,060
so that you're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain when</font>

1065
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:47,750
somebody and ask you<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions like that</font>

1066
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:49,880
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can explain develop a</font>

1067
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:51,110
vocabulary and use it that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1068
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,330
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some terms in the beginning</font>

1069
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:55,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that everyone can understand</font>

1070
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:58,009
what you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about remember your</font>

1071
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,200
audience again like I said the dashboard

1072
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:03,350
the CTO CS should not be the dashboard

1073
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,569
that your sis admin sees and the more

1074
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:08,180
efficient your process is for mediators

1075
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:10,340
the more they're going to remediate so

1076
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:12,740
you know basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it efficient</font>

1077
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:14,150
automate as much as you can and<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

1078
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:16,250
end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day you want to reduce as</font>

1079
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,960
much risk as possible so if you can make

1080
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:20,540
it a efficient process for the

1081
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:25,160
remediated then you're probably going to

1082
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:31,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">be most successful does anyone have any</font>

1083
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:33,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions yes Sam</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like content</font>

1084
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:36,410
management or like<font color="#CCCCCC"> cmdb or 0</font>

1085
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:39,879
configuration management<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like a</font>

1086
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:39,879
policy compliance scanner

1087
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:54,569
literally anyone who got you need one

1088
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:55,890
yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i've used</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> qualis as a</font>

1089
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:59,369
vulnerability scanner at both

1090
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:02,098
organizations I you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't like to</font>

1091
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:04,020
promote or demote any particular tool

1092
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:05,790
because there's no one-size-fits-all for

1093
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:08,220
your organization but I'm definitely a

1094
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:09,779
big fan of<font color="#CCCCCC"> qualis on as your</font>

1095
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:14,879
vulnerability scanner<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does also have</font>

1096
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:17,490
an agent solution again I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1097
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,290
develop to design the database myself on

1098
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:21,598
that these<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did not design our back-end</font>

1099
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:23,579
database myself we used our essay<font color="#E5E5E5"> Archer</font>

1100
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,369
and we just ran into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of situations</font>

1101
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:28,859
where we were limited by the types of

1102
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:30,960
reports we could run on you know we

1103
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:33,540
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be taking snapshots of trending</font>

1104
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,990
data and then a leader would decide oh

1105
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:38,460
wait but what about like this data by

1106
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:40,740
severity it's like we didn't take the

1107
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:42,210
snapshots by severity so now we can't go

1108
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:44,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">back in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and answer that question</font>

1109
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:47,099
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so if I have that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1110
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:48,869
control to design the database myself so

1111
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:51,180
that I preserve that data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I can</font>

1112
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:53,910
always answer those questions that's why

1113
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:56,520
I personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer to develop it myself</font>

1114
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:59,609
over a over a cost product there's also

1115
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:02,220
another solution called Kenna and it's

1116
00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:04,230
supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a lot of these things and</font>

1117
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:06,118
the whole threat intelligence piece

1118
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:08,250
that's supposed to also take that into

1119
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:10,319
consideration it's supposed to also<font color="#E5E5E5"> tie</font>

1120
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:11,730
finding together if like your<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen tester</font>

1121
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,869
found them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then your scanner found</font>

1122
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:16,319
them it's supposed to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

1123
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:18,510
okay this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same finding so I would</font>

1124
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:20,308
encourage you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know explore all</font>

1125
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:21,569
the different options and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

1126
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:26,000
choose the one that's best for your

1127
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:34,400
organization sure yes

1128
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:36,620
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> qualis it's less than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 of a</font>

1129
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,420
percent that's what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertise and</font>

1130
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:40,700
with my experience over the past three

1131
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:43,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">years that's definitely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been the case i</font>

1132
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:45,439
would say i reported five or six false

1133
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:47,180
positives to them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm in</font>

1134
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:51,200
environments where we have you know

1135
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:53,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">80,000 some assets so you know in a</font>

1136
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:57,589
large environment like that only five

1137
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:59,240
that's a really small number so yeah

1138
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:01,250
again if you can get a good tool then

1139
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:20,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">false-positive should be a rare issue</font>

1140
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:21,890
any other questions yes I think it's

1141
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,439
wrapping your head around all the data

1142
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:27,799
as you can see you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of</font>

1143
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:29,960
like a data project on it's beyond just

1144
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:34,040
the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to you have to</font>

1145
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:36,740
explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> this all to you have to convert</font>

1146
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:38,300
this to a language that your executive

1147
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:40,189
leadership can understand like is your

1149
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:43,400
doing better<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not and when you have</font>

1150
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:45,350
all these caveats and all these things

1151
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that can influence how many findings</font>

1152
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:50,509
there are and how many are getting sick

1153
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:52,759
and it's it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to wrap your</font>

1154
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:55,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">head around all that data you really</font>

1155
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:58,070
have to keep a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

1156
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:00,770
points and find a<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to queried all</font>

1157
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:02,950
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all join together and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell the</font>

1158
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:02,950
right story

1159
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,730
yeah so i haven't done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yet but that</font>

1160
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:23,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">would definitely be a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> youth pace</font>

1161
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:25,589
for this data in the example<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font>

1162
00:47:23,609 --> 00:47:27,779
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about before where if an of</font>

1163
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:29,940
technologies identified like<font color="#E5E5E5"> java and</font>

1164
00:47:27,779 --> 00:47:32,940
you could say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you can look at the</font>

1165
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:34,890
tickets for<font color="#CCCCCC"> these java finding findings</font>

1166
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:37,650
and show okay this is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hours of</font>

1167
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:40,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">labor were devoted to fixing Java</font>

1168
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:43,619
updates then you could say okay well

1169
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:45,509
this application is added<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs due to</font>

1170
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:47,009
ongoing remediation so you could

1171
00:47:45,509 --> 00:47:49,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely make points like that I</font>

1172
00:47:47,009 --> 00:47:50,430
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done it yet but that's a good</font>

1173
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:52,500
point because there are a lot of other

1174
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:54,149
use cases for this data<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1175
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:56,640
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't realize the data that we</font>

1176
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:58,230
collect in security can be used for so

1177
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,578
many other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can provide to</font>

1178
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:01,980
the business<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they want to know</font>

1179
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:22,079
about so that in itself is an extra

1180
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:24,690
value I think yes yes so like I said

1181
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">qualis is on it has a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> low false</font>

1182
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:28,710
positive rate and I think one of the

1183
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:30,930
reasons it does is because it

1184
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:33,420
categorizes its findings on confirmed

1185
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:35,609
findings and potential findings so

1186
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:37,289
confirmed ones I mean I've never even

1187
00:48:35,609 --> 00:48:39,598
been in an organization that even looks

1188
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:41,640
at the potential findings but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

1189
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,920
it's defined is confirmed means every

1190
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,598
check within the signature came back as

1191
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,369
in you know that's definitely a

1192
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,019
vulnerability if you get a potential

1193
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:50,730
finding it means some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the checks and</font>

1194
00:48:49,019 --> 00:48:52,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">the signature came back and then other</font>

1195
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:54,750
ones couldn't be determined maybe they

1196
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:57,029
didn't have access to the host or

1197
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:59,339
whatnot but if you just look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

1198
00:48:57,029 --> 00:49:01,289
confirmed finding it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font>

1199
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:03,890
false positive rate and that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> collis</font>

1200
00:49:01,289 --> 00:49:03,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a cloud solution</font>

1201
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:11,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I think we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about out of time</font>

1202
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:12,570
so thanks for coming to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk I</font>

1203
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:15,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">appreciate it</font>

1204
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:15,019
