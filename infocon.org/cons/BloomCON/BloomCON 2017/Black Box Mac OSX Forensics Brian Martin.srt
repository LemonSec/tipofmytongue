<font color="#E5E5E5">whether it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> black Loch forensics but</font>

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,698
same difference I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to talk</font>

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,500
on max because they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming up</font>

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,000
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more we should never see them</font>

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,448
you know with you lad max where security

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very few of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around some</font>

everybody got max they're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font>

12
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:38,218
place and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what other the talk</font>

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,460
would be appropriate so that we could

14
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,530
look at how things work how they boot

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,420
and why things get erased are they

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,200
better than pcs for security are they

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,370
worse how difficult is it I'm not going

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,829
to leave the podium because I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

19
00:00:50,370 --> 00:01:01,890
see my speakers notice yes technology

20
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:05,400
works i love it so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> who I am why</font>

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,650
I'm here<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian Martin the names in there</font>

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,450
big deal I only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

24
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,470
company we're lots of fun I've been

<font color="#E5E5E5">doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this for an awful long time I</font>

26
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,759
probably forgotten more than most people

27
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,189
need to learn to do the job between

rest so

30
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,960
in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all of that course we</font>

few slides and then we'll get<font color="#CCCCCC"> rockin</font>

34
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,830
most important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take away from</font>

35
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,429
here other than I deny all

36
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:41,550
responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> for everything is this</font>

37
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,810
part right here if you forensic<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight</font>

38
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:47,130
consider this is just one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

39
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,240
guideposts stuff changes so even as I

40
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,789
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through and building this</font>

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,419
things we're changing especially with

42
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,670
the latest release of the US but six

43
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,289
only in motion I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had a</font>

44
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,509
case yet where I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to go and</font>

45
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:04,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">dig something new out of the woodwork to</font>

46
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:06,899
figure out how to ask questions anybody

47
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">in here is already a skilled OSX</font>

49
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:18,180
bored more<font color="#E5E5E5"> stories though okay and we'll</font>

50
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:22,110
see how good my timing is this year<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

51
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,060
year I'd to rescue this stuff not take

52
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,239
away from this when we're talking about

53
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:30,720
all these tools go and get training

54
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,850
professional training<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube is great</font>

55
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,410
but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try and run a production shop</font>

56
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:38,489

58
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:42,120
cause you a world agree so use

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,829
professional tools get professional

60
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,470
training work for a company that will

pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that for you get very</font>

62
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">good at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and then spin off your own</font>

63
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,179
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then you know what is it on</font>

64
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:57,540
cash checks or whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying is</font>

65
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,209
make bank whatever there's a ton of work

66
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,130
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there there's a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of work we are</font>

67
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:04,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">always behind there's always stuff</font>

68
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,420
falling down there's no competition

69
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:08,459
whatsoever there's three people in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

70
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,790
Lehigh Valley to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and I have</font>

71
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:14,670
never run into them<font color="#CCCCCC"> on any job we work</font>

72
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,140
pretty much everywhere but literally

73
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,149
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a great field to be in</font>

74
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,869
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> since it crosses into</font>

75
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:26,340
security with red hat and red team and

76
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,780
blue team black hat so good career

77
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,069
choice those of you that are here for

78
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,930
the forensic stuff

79
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:36,060
and if you're in business we'll talk if

80
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:39,180
you're going to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> X ways which is a</font>

81
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,489
phenomenal tool but extremely painful

82
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,079
you really need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to blow the eight</font>

83
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,400
hundred dollars for the training class

84
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:46,170
if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get up and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> running</font>

85
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,730
quickly you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably figure it out</font>

86
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,589
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> all smart but there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

87
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,980
actually does in strange ways that are

88
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,480
painful to learn and the book is not

89
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,819
adequate although the course does cover

90
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:04,048
the book material<font color="#E5E5E5"> so enough pitching for</font>

91
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:07,379
other vendors stuff why did I decide to

92
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:12,389
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this I've had a couple bad</font>

93
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:13,290
experiences over the years between the

94
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:15,989
lack of coaching the lack of

95
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,120
professional advice dialogue and a

96
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,440
distinct<font color="#CCCCCC"> lack of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> research materials I</font>

97
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,329
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we should throw a talk</font>

98
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,270
together and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover the basics in</font>

99
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:26,340
the hopes that you guys would then go

100
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:29,070
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do some very specific detail</font>

101
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,888
oriented talks there are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple things</font>

102
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,969
out there in particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a we're</font>

103
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:34,620
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to list it later but there's some</font>

104
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,570
good there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple good talks now it</font>

105
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,970
used to be a wasteland this used to be a

106
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,289
very difficult field oh I section but

107
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,210
it's gotten better there are some better

108
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:45,990
books out there if you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font>

109
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:48,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">in OS X with OSX forensics read them all</font>

110
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,310
until you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that you're not reading</font>

111
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,960
anything new anymore because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

112
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,030
seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a little something extra to</font>

113
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,020
offer and after you read the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one</font>

114
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,530
you can get through the restroom real

115
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,669
quick so we're going to talk about not

116
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,109
only ill effects but the problems that

117
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:03,030
we've encountered going through the

118
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,470
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this and like I said the war</font>

119
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,580
stories are going to be fun but we're

120
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,460
not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to dwell on them there is</font>

121
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:12,930
technical material in this talk if you

122
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:16,138
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not know who here knows how to use</font>

123
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:19,500
command line operations off anything

124
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:22,680
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> not know command line stuff okay</font>

125
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:27,560
we it becomes a hard parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't worry</font>

126
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:32,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it no test stuff</font>

127
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:35,360
so the funny story inch were here is

128
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:41,210
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a call from a guy who I trust</font>

129
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:44,240
I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just stay there and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he says can</font>

130
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:47,000
you image a mac for me and if you

131
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand the business you know that</font>

132
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,940
there's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this than just imaging</font>

133
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,409
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and nobody hands you a book</font>

134
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,389
those images thank you very much<font color="#CCCCCC"> is your</font>

135
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:55,940
money its image this and then do

136
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:57,470
operations on it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he says he's in a</font>

137
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,680
bind and he meets the thing imaged right

138
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:03,110
away and can he send it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's you</font>

139
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,690
sure no prob your friend all I'm is it

140
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,910
no big deal so he sends it out to me and

141
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:13,310
we image it takes us about two hours

142
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:14,720
it's a 500 gig hard drive and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

143
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:18,080
call it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what you want son with it</font>

144
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,430
he's like you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> done like yeah why well</font>

145
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,750
because the FBI<font color="#E5E5E5"> had it for two weeks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

146
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,850
they couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get it imaged what do you</font>

147
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,139
mean the FBI had it for two weeks well

148
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,550
this guy that we hired was from the FBI

149
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:28,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">had it for two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks and he couldn't</font>

150
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:30,169
figure out how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get an image what I'm</font>

151
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:33,049
like my bloomin brands though if you

152
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:35,810
know OSX at all if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Macintosh oh</font>

153
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:38,660
look you know that copying a hard drive

154
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:41,000
is built into the OS right its built-in

155
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,680
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you know as easy as putting it</font>

156
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,020
up and doing a word document but it's

157
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">not terribly difficult it's something</font>

158
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,770
that anybody who says on the FBI agent

159
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:53,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">nah no forensics they should be able to</font>

160
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:54,919
pull<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one off that's not hard ok so</font>

161
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,450
don't claim you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it if you can't</font>

162
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:57,799
if someone's offering a job to do in

163
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,260
forensics and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have the skills</font>

164
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,389
don't don't offer to do it the second

165
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,940
thing is certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get paid in</font>

166
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:06,080
advance the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are supposed to</font>

167
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,020
you're all worried he's supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

168
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,729
right don't offer the evidence which

169
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:15,229
brings us to the funny part of the story

170
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:18,740
so he<font color="#CCCCCC"> asks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do some processing on</font>

171
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:20,180
it and we start going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

172
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,130
digging out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why the talk is</font>

173
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,280
called black bag forensics because he

174
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:28,789
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell us what we're looking for I'm</font>

175
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,900
like you have anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can give</font>

176
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:31,490
us he's like yeah they were doing

177
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:35,900
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in AWS and they crashed a</font>

178
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:38,360
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of servers in the cloud</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so why</font>

179
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,568
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me a macbook well because</font>

180
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,330
we think they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from there</font>

181
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:43,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is and this is going back</font>

182
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,998
<font color="#CCCCCC">and forth over a period of days here</font>

183
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:46,409
because he's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to the client and</font>

184
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:48,479
ask them questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he's got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

185
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:50,279
back and it's all started with will you

186
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,399
image the smack and now we're talking

187
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:58,589
AWS which is a whole nother ball of wax

188
00:07:53,399 --> 00:08:04,949
so it start digging through it and

189
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:06,479
eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> dawns on me that the timeline</font>

190
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:08,279
that we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> activity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

191
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:14,369
doesn't match the timeline of activity

192
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:17,699
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk so I map it all out and I</font>

193
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:19,289
call him back huh I'm like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> said you</font>

194
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:24,240
guys took possession of this on the 13th

195
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:25,349
yeah I got it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the 19 huh well</font>

196
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,789
something like that it was two<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks</font>

197
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:31,589
lapse between when they got it when I

198
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:33,299
got it why is their activity in between

199
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:37,349
when nobody should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had this thing I</font>

200
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,848
don't know let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> find out so cultured</font>

201
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:40,680
back he's like yeah the FBI guy turned

202
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:44,730
it on so he could see if he could copy

203
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:47,250
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back to rule number one right</font>

204
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,920
don't change your work in forensics and

205
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:52,019
you don't understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so take a</font>

206
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,360
short segue from that talk to talk about

207
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">another thing similar issue you're going</font>

208
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:01,740
to come across this stuff all the time

209
00:08:55,529 --> 00:09:03,959
the last text that I had so I no longer

210
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,850
have will<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent out into the field to</font>

211
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:08,160
collect the drive and we don't send them

212
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,860
out uninitiated right we tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them how</font>

213
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,420
to do the job we train them get them to

214
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,149
understand go through the process you

215
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,610
know what you're doing he image the

216
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:20,670
drive and then he turned it back on so

217
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:23,490
he copied the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hostname which of course</font>

218
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,870
he could have gotten from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> image or</font>

219
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,880
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have just asked somebody in</font>

220
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:29,220
the organization but<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this stuff</font>

221
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,420
happens it happens all the time luckily

222
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,670
I was smart enough not to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> him out</font>

223
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,829
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a job that it mattered because you'll</font>

224
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,120
learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> that lesson to know your risks</font>

225
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:38,430
risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> management is a part of everything</font>

226
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,439
that was part of my risk thankfully<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

227
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,300
managed it well that time and we didn't

228
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:44,310
hurt anything but things like that

229
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,430
happened so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have super FBI guy</font>

230
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:50,369
in turn I got two calls last week for

231
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:52,079
incident response on virus stuff in both

232
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases they called us after the head</font>

233
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:55,149
tried to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

234
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,649
after they knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the machines were</font>

235
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:59,200
infected after they knew that they

236
00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:00,700
probably had a ph I exposure they tried

237
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">to work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on it themselves and then they</font>

238
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:06,940
called us you have an infinite response

239
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:09,160
policy that says step<font color="#CCCCCC"> one call the</font>

240
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,290
forensics guys we have them on contract

241
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:17,589
you're paying us money call us<font color="#CCCCCC"> no no</font>

242
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:21,399
we'll fix it ourselves sure you will so

243
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:22,630
when you turn a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac on one of the key</font>

244
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it does and this is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

245
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,870
the most important things are here in

246
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,339
this course today for is if it's been

247
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:30,880
sitting for anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> at any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> length of</font>

248
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:36,910
time like two weeks and you turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on</font>

249
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:39,100
anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what's going to happen and</font>

250
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:43,719
this is a combination of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bsd and apple</font>

251
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:47,500
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to roll the logs because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

252
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,089
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than a week old do you know</font>

253
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,940
what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a unix system when you</font>

254
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:55,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">roll logs the old files are no longer</font>

255
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,670
there if you happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to catch it at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

256
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:01,270
very moment you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to recover</font>

257
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:04,060
that data from disk because<font color="#CCCCCC"> OS x vs de</font>

258
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:05,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">linux don't operate like windows what</font>

259
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:10,060
does windows do with files are you

260
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:12,000
deleted leave them there what else does

261
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,270
it do

262
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,270
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it leaves them there for as</font>

263
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:20,100
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it can it will intentionally</font>

264
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:22,410
avoid those areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the disk until it</font>

265
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,730
is used up all the blank disk space it

266
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,890
will avoid them they'll still be there

267
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,750
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why years after somebody has</font>

268
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,370
done something on a PC with Windows you

269
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,750
can go in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> get everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they did on</font>

270
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:34,920
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> file</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or I'll still there</font>

271
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:36,420
not with OS X or Linux or UNIX when it

272
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,370
rolls files that space becomes

273
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,199
immediately available in the OS will<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

274
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:42,060
it when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels like it which is</font>

275
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,350
usually pretty darn quick because

276
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,900
there's so much going on these days

277
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,970
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why it's so critical not to</font>

278
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,740
turn something on if it's off or to

279
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,930
leave something on if it's running

280
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,690
because you can't get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory</font>

281
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:57,300
forensic stuff if they turn it on that's

282
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,710
happened twice this week with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

283
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:08,579
who called us hey can you work on this

284
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:11,850
yeah ah I forgot I had a slide for this

285
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:13,590
that's Tom Hanks from the movie houston

286
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,390
we have a problem yeah we have a big

287
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:17,040
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the case that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

288
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:21,990
on now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the system logs of rolled</font>

289
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:24,240
there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can do there's</font>

290
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:27,270
some material on the box but<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

291
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,540
because the forensic examination team

292
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,980
changed the evidence there's no way

293
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,520
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> after this guy for criminal</font>

294
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:38,550
behavior so they totally shot themselves

295
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:41,339
in the foot with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one it happens</font>

296
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,959
that's the risk if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't me that</font>

297
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:44,220
would do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you could then sue me</font>

298
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,320
that's where we have malpractice

299
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,839
insurance so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when we screw up you</font>

300
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,930
can sue us and you get money luckily

301
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't me it was them and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

302
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,719
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sourced the whole problem</font>

303
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,640
was so embarrassed by the whole thing

304
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,060
that they just shut it down and now's

305
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,060
the end of that

306
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:14,560
spongebob the memes are in there to keep

307
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:19,960
you awake<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pictures I know because</font>

308
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:22,089
some of the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really dry so bonus</font>

309
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,320
points<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you know the full origin of</font>

310
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:28,150
memes they get still not done you're

311
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:29,650
like a approach each case that you're

312
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:32,079
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with a very defined target</font>

313
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,490
the problem with black box forensics and

314
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,080
not knowing what you're looking for is

315
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,550
that these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are so bloody big</font>

316
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,860
these days and there's so many different

317
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:42,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">areas that to look in that if you can't</font>

318
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:44,770
focus on a particular area you're going

319
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:47,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">to waste a lot of clients money so it's</font>

320
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:49,090
very important to figure out what it is

321
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,830
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find talk to the client</font>

322
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:52,060
get specific usually it's very simple

323
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,920
they come to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're like this</font>

324
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,650
guy was doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad stuff what kind of bad</font>

325
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,839
stuff the stuff to do with pictures<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

326
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:00,100
I know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for now the stuff to</font>

327
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,050
do with intellectual property what

328
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,110
intellectual property we can't tell you

329
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:07,870
I can't work on again if you have to

330
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,310
give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go on if I'm going</font>

331
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">to find it anyways you might as well</font>

332
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">tell me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it lawyers do strange things</font>

333
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:15,010
companies do strange things it's your

334
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,480
job<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the person doing the forensics to</font>

335
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,520
work with them use your social

336
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,620
engineering skills<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get them to cough</font>

337
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:27,850
up whatever information you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font>

338
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:29,590
a firm solid fence around your goals the

339
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:33,700
surest way to pain and suffering on your

340
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:37,360
project to scope it incorrectly for

341
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:39,190
example looks like the image problem the

342
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,830
way the state police the way the

343
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:45,310
Attorney General<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way the people that</font>

344
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:49,120
process CP picture problems is a very

345
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:51,459
narrow defined set of operations they

346
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,100
know what they're looking for they go in

347
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,420
and they find it and they're done they

348
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">have their case they have their evidence</font>

349
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:02,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">that done there's no extenuating</font>

350
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:04,720
circumstances there's no other

351
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,550
descriptive<font color="#CCCCCC"> activity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the system that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">are going to help the client from their</font>

353
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:12,069
perspective so if you have a defense

354
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:14,470
attorney come to you and ask you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help</font>

defend its client in the CP case one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

356
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,440
the things you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

357
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,880
a certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> set of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things with always ask</font>

for one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,340
ask you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is show that this was not</font>

his primary interest or her to be her

361
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:33,040
it's never her if you're downloading

may in fact accidentally gown something

00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:40,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's illegal that could happen and</font>

365
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:43,030
that would generally be a valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> excuse</font>

366
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,880
but when your entire cache of search

367
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:49,180
terms is pretty expensive and exclusive

368
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:52,600
to a particular type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of image then</font>

369
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:55,000
you're pretty much done for but it pays

370

even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't have a defensive you</font>

371
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,540
can mount but if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that</font>

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">limit so that they have their scope and</font>

373
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,430
we had our scope and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went in looking</font>

374
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:08,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">for things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GP and we</font>

00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,060
didn't find<font color="#CCCCCC"> any so that was that was the</font>

376
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:12,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">end of that case that was short no</font>

377
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,780
testimony please settle immediately or

378
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:18,490
whatever they're offering you because

379
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:19,689
you're done for but we didn't go in

380
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:22,030
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for audit trails in the</font>

381
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,230
operating system like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thumbnail cash</font>

382
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,880
database which we'll talk about in a

383
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,710
second we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went in for something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

384
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,110
specific if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for</font>

385
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:32,800
intellectual property and you happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

386
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:39,490
find CP are you obligated to report it

387
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:41,530
anybody yes you must must always report

388
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:43,210
CP you take it back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

389
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:45,339
say you either report this or I have to

390
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:48,100
and then you help them manage that

391
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:50,290
process because nobody wants the cops

392
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,780
coming in raw and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking all your</font>

393
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,699
stuff especially if you've got numerous

394
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,689
expensive forensics boxes now have

395
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">copies of that stuff on it</font>

396
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:18,260
putting a fence around things<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice image</font>

397
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:19,760
yeah there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff we talked about</font>

398
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,140
it's things like if they're asking you

399
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,959
for HIPAA<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to bother looking for</font>

400
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,370
images yes sometimes you do so things

401
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,030
like HIPAA can be broader than other

402
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:30,679
concepts pci is very cut-and-dried

403
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,360
you're looking for things to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

404
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,250
credit cards and money you don't care

405
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the fact that there's pictures of</font>

406
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:40,280
trees on there but if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

407
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,930
HIPAA you've got not only data raw data

408
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:48,200
all sorts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> database formats you've</font>

409
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:50,030
also got the images and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

410
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,740
sure you have clear concrete goals

411
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:57,530
that's a PA state trooper that's only

412
00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:02,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">like last year that must</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been fun</font>

413
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:08,600
explaining set the scope appropriately

414
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:11,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">pH</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I blah blah blah yeah the tools the</font>

00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,110
tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use</font>

416
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,080
does anybody use a tool that's not up

417
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,820
there other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I refuse</font>

418
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">to say their name you probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

419
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:24,710
figure out who that is concordance

420
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:26,629

doing multiple things at the same time

432
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:56,450
means you can get to the end faster

433
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,790
because it takes so long to process a

443
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:21,200

proud of their software they all do

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> different which is why you'll</font>

end up with multiple tools aside from

the ability to parallel process there

479

are different layers of tools in here

when it comes to the OSX type stuff you

you probably eventually get there

anyways but some of the settings that

488
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:07,790

more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that because it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

don't know how we ended up there but I

517

know the CIA has all our files now

which brings up an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting question</font>

Android and Google or Apple and iTunes

and so on if you're using your phone to

524
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:53,540
document stuff be very aware<font color="#CCCCCC"> that those</font>

there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still a place in this world for</font>

lose it or drop it at that point it's

532
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,660
gone so you have to take additional

533
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:15,050
precautions it's so much easier to use

534
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:16,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">these but your contract probably</font>

get into that so with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the noise</font>

540
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,490
that's out there if you start googling

any of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> technical stuff in here</font>

542
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:34,040
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a hard time finding</font>

separating the signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the noise</font>

there's not any reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> to withhold</font>

rest<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us have to deal with images and</font>

stuff apple store stuff all over the

operating system so even if somebody

662

looks up how do i clean my mac

663

how do i erase files from a matter how I

00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:25,010
command line if you do everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

671
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,440
the shell and you understand how the

shell track stuff and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> bsd track</font>

673
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:34,070
stuff then it's fairly trivial to be

00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:38,960
invisible which is good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know but at</font>

almost nobody does that because

677
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:46,879
criminals are stupid so here's what the

678
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:52,310
stuff looks like when you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

not only on the GUI like I looked at

689
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:25,970
this file but also why it's called the

701
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,860
thumbnails fast enough to keep up with

<font color="#E5E5E5">you but when you're doing things it will</font>

703
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,149
be storing stuff in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> some nail</font>

704
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:00,650
database and it doesn't delete it which

705
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:02,450
is good because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it rolled the SIS logs</font>

706
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:05,090
when we weren't looking and this thing

707
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:06,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">is still there so we're still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this</font>

708
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:08,330
can show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you not only that someone</font>

709
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,770
looked at something as a thumbnail can

00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:12,260
also show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at a larger</font>

711
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:13,100
view and in the other logs you can see

712
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,740
whether they looked at the entire

713
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,629
picture so it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to reconstruct</font>

717
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:39,860
can start croaking metadata stuff like

that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have mentioned that at</font>

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">oxx well and then I did say there's a</font>

lifts with you can use standalone tools

728
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,810
you can use your forensic tools like

729
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:12,260
black light which have all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us built</font>

735
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:28,640
generally those things work on all of

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,080
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating system features just fine</font>

standalone tools your mileage may vary

739
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,810
plus you may have difficulty with those

740
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:44,050
in court which is why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should be</font>

using proper tools anything

<font color="#CCCCCC">oh the command line here at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom</font>

743
00:32:49,510 --> 00:33:00,220
is pretty cool lets you change the

settings for quick quick look lets you

there's a /c on the previous version

758

preview cash database so if there's no

which you should go and watch it is just

an hour long this is the quick look

on this most things most tools convert

it automatically but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have to do</font>

779

it manually the dates are the second

00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:49,989
since 11 2001 and that is used to be

very<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out just by</font>

googling because the web is so bad

but we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> much better these days</font>

and or Google is doing better i'm not

out all these links are live I say about

this yeah I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't emphasize this</font>

793
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,470
too much if the system is running do

your mem dump and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it to be</font>

it on especially the brand new<font color="#E5E5E5"> batch the</font>

797
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:09,400
new ones this year have an even funner

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:11,799
feature where to put it and that when

799
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,740
you lift the lid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the mac it</font>

800
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,690
automatically turns on which is of

801
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,520
course terrifying for those of us if

802
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:21,490
you're fast on the keys you can get it

803
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,930
not to boot the disk but it's still one

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those you need to be prepared for</font>

805
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,419
this which is why<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to</font>

806
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">people you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep up with</font>

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:37,090
new one lift the lid logs rotate you

809
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:40,810
know he told<font color="#E5E5E5"> us about that optional key</font>

to stop image imaging<font color="#CCCCCC"> video as anybody</font>

with just the USBC port now that is it

813
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:50,320
pure joy you have like four dongles that

814
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:53,500
have to connect together with a power

815
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,720
input to get it to image across that

816
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,849
link because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only those ports</font>

817
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:02,140
it's all it's all on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet now</font>

818
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:03,340
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's USB CD USB a into Thunderbolt</font>

819

or whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you're getting it out</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it has to be a powered adapter if</font>

821
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:10,660
you have a non-powered adapter and you

822
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:13,930
try this out it may or may not copy data

823
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:15,670
at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if it does you better pray</font>

824
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:18,430
that that battery doesn't die while

825
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:20,320
you're copying that data so that's why

826
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:30,940
we use powered ones back to the funny

827
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:32,710
slide the lid thing was something

828
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:35,440
specifically knew that I learned just

for this session since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have a</font>

read because if you find out after the

fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're in trouble you'll become a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">with some command line stuff because</font>

840
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:20,160
that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the that's when the black</font>

841
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:23,009
are alive

842
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:26,520
terminal is very much a<font color="#E5E5E5"> love-hate</font>

843
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:28,859
relationship we love<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bash history at</font>

844
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">least I do unfortunately it's really</font>

845
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:33,089
easy to delete if you delete the bash

846
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,520
history and then you computer it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone</font>

847
00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:38,490
and no going back and looking for

848
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,599
deleted bash histories like everything

849
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:41,038
else<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens at the command line</font>

850
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:46,470
level once it's gone it's gone

851
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:48,690
essentially it is possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

852
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:50,009
theoretically possible that<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

853
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:52,920
could do some stuff on the disk and then

854
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:55,260
erase a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of large files and</font>

855
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,930
that trace would still remain out there

856
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:59,160
on that further cylinder<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the disk but</font>

857
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:01,109
the likelihood<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that happening is</font>

858
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,879
extremely rare just stuff in the command

859
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:06,720
line doesn't happen or doesn't last so

860
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,760
be careful one of the useful things

861
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">about command line is that it can</font>

862
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:14,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">identify a user if you have access to</font>

863
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,500
government level software there is a

864
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:18,960
tool that will pull in all of the

865
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,480
command line activity for a user or a

866
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,799
group of users and tell you which ones

867
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,779
are the same person and to what

868
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:26,220
confidence level which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty cool</font>

869
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,410
stuff to kind of spooky but it kind of

870
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,640
makes sense when you make mistakes using

871
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:34,200
command line<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you make the same</font>

mistakes all the time LS dash al or LS

873
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,890
dash LA which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no mistake but it's</font>

874
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:40,200
different way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing things users do</font>

875
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:41,910
things differently I make the same typos

876
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,109
every time because my fingers work in a

877
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,759
certain way yours<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked in a certain</font>

878
00:39:43,109 --> 00:39:46,558
way that's how they identify as

879
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,270
forensically based on what are typing is

880
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:50,220
our fingers all work differently so it

881
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:51,599
will all make different mistakes bash

882
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:56,578
history can show you that you're dealing

883
00:39:51,599 --> 00:40:02,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">with two users using the same user ID if</font>

884
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:06,779
you can do those sort of comparisons if

885
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:09,270
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at a directory in the OS</font>

886
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:12,089
as opposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> in finder there is no</font>

887
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:16,288
record of it other than in the syslog

888
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:19,069
but there's no thumbnail cast database

889
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:19,069
updates or anything like that

890
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:31,270
of course copying an image<font color="#CCCCCC"> in finder is</font>

891
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:34,360
going to show up and be different than

892
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:36,460
in the command line you're going to get

893
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:39,670
the activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists different thumbnails</font>

894
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:41,830
lots of stuff if you do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the GUI</font>

895
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,580
use lots of trace lots and lots of trace

896
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,080
if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing with an</font>

897
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,520
unsophisticated user and they're using

898
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:49,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">the GUI you're not going to have much</font>

899
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:53,170
difficulty at all but in the command

900
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:55,149
line this is almost nothing if you're

901
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:56,380
lucky there's a syslog entry and if

902
00:40:55,150 --> 00:41:12,460
you're lucky there's a bass history

903
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:15,370
there we go so some of the ways that

904
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:17,830
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be finding sign for</font>

905
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:19,180
you're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with criminals especially</font>

906
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:20,710
a way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out that somebody knows</font>

907
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,870
that they're a criminal is it going to

908
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:24,730
be files missing so things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that aren't</font>

909
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:29,500
there are almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> as useful as things</font>

910
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:30,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are there if they've erased their</font>

911
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,960
bash history that's going to tell you

912
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,530
that there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> there that might</font>

913
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:40,090
be worth looking at if they've erased

914
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:41,440
log files unfortunately if they're

915
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:42,910
erasing you can't get them back at them

916
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,530
and help a whole lot but at least gives

917
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:46,600
you justification for terminating the

918
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:48,160
employee you did bad things we don't

919
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:56,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what it was but we know it was bad</font>

920
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:58,509
you're fired no problems there if they

921
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,820
were doing things in the GUI though even

922
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:04,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">if they erase the user ID thinking they</font>

923
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:06,730
were smart those entries in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Darwin user</font>

924
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:08,500
cache the files table things like that

925
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:10,330
will still be there there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an</font>

926
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:12,340
identifier you will not be able to map

927
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:14,080
it to a user ID so you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

928
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:17,050
conclude that there was a user ID and

929
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:20,130
that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not there now which may or</font>

930
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:20,130
may not be useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your case</font>

931
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:26,960
we've talked about some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

932
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,119
users billing not billing for work that

933
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,329
they do so if you're trying to figure

934
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if somebody's been doing work they</font>

935
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:36,290
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this person is lazy and</font>

936
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:37,819
shiftless and you want to show that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

937
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:40,880
have or have not been doing their work

938
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:45,170
what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some things that we've talked</font>

939
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:47,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that you can go look for history</font>

940
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:50,869
you look for history but there's no time

941
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:51,859
in history so you see all these commands

942
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:53,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you don't know when they were done</font>

943
00:42:51,859 --> 00:42:56,328
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the downsides of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bash</font>

944
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:59,720
and one of the downsides of VI history

945
00:42:56,329 --> 00:43:01,010
or VI whichever it is they're useful for

946
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,970
telling you what somebody did but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

947
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:08,720
when they did it but the syslog

948
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:12,020
definitely will right so the files can

949
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,240
be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show activity if a person</font>

950
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:16,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">says that they weren't doing something</font>

951
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,410
at a certain time and you can see

952
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,670
activity in the syslog that shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

953
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:20,960
something with they were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

954
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:22,880
it was on the command line you don't

955
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,859
know exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

956
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:29,270
they were active and doing stuff you can

957
00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:31,279
catch them in a line hopefully the more

958
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:38,599
detail<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but that may be what</font>

959
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:40,339
you get other items will be spreadsheets

960
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:44,210
threatening emails in gmail command line

961
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:46,490
abuse these things all exist let's see

962
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:50,940
now we get to the tricky part can I<font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font>

963
00:43:46,490 --> 00:44:07,078
stuff and get back to

964
00:43:50,940 --> 00:44:10,680
pop<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that okay so far so good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

965
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:26,849
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to do anything live and talk</font>

966
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:48,060
because of things like this Oh wrong a

967
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:49,560
lot of evil is wrong oh there we go and

968
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,450
so here's a shot of what it looks like

969
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,400
inside of the chrome keys of the

970
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:56,790
personal directory you've got all these

971
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,170
wonderful files they're all L BBS some

972
00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:01,770
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them have nothing in them some of</font>

973
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:04,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">them have stuff in them it depends on</font>

974
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:05,880
that I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go into like</font>

975
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:08,670
what chrome has because there's a

976
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:12,450
thousand different apps we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

977
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:15,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with apps in a</font>

978
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:17,069
couple slides but there's stuff on here

979
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,530
for everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's installed on the</font>

980
00:45:17,069 --> 00:45:23,720
mac specifically for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and they</font>

981
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:23,720
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> have their own directory</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> setup</font>

982
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:33,238

knowing what chrome has to show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1005
00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:46,198
with for litigation is if you compose an

1006
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:50,309
email in anything any tool in Windows

1007
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:51,899
where's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data while you're composing</font>

1008
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:58,049
that email and sending it where is that

1009
00:46:51,899 --> 00:47:04,769
data is in it file the had to bring it

1010
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:08,788
up didn't I the memory file the memory

1011
00:47:04,769 --> 00:47:10,308
file that is called the halo my brain

1012
00:47:08,789 --> 00:47:14,420
dozers

1013
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:18,319
anyways in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows it's always on that</font>

1014
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:19,430
file until it until it ages out what's

1015
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:24,890
the memory file on windows called

file unfortunately max don't have that

1018
00:47:30,769 --> 00:47:37,339
so if you're composing it in gmail and

1019
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:40,369
then you send it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on you have some</font>

1021
00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:44,689

<font color="#E5E5E5">come on there it is how to find all the</font>

that are active you'll notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1047
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:16,960
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not one for root root does not</font>

traditionally produce a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bash history</font>

1049
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,810
unless you explicitly tell your root

00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:25,750
user to use back so normal useful as

1051
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:27,700
root will not produce this log that's

1052
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:41,910
sort of important to know so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1053
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:41,910
thinking that they erased it<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ok</font>

1054
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:55,140
this harkens back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first time we</font>

1055
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:57,180
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about different find options</font>

1059
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:08,819
here if you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and look for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bosch</font>

1061
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:13,080
it won't find it which is the dumbest

1064
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:21,030
it works you can find it from the

1065
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:24,000
command line but<font color="#E5E5E5"> finder is not very</font>

notice again it only found one copy

1069
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:35,730
there is no deleted there is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> backup</font>

1070
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:39,870
you only get the one copy so if they

1071
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:41,940
erase it it's gone this is some fun

1072

you do not conclude and tell the lawyer

00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:02,810
come along on the opposite side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1123
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:04,430
table and say well yeah that's what's in

1124
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:06,680
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bass history but in the syslog it</font>

1125
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:08,359
shows that it was this then you've just

1126
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,529
made a terrible mistake and you're going

1127
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to lose this case because you're</font>

1128
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:14,150
presenting material that can't be backed

1129
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:16,669
up with facts understand all of the

1130
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:19,280
technical capabilities of this thing and

1131
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:22,760
don't draw conclusions from missing data

1132
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:25,460
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't find any CP he must</font>

1133
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:27,620
have erased it this is not consistent

1134
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:29,090
logically just because it's not there

1135
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:31,009
doesn't mean it was there and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> acted</font>

1136
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:36,620
badly but we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like that all</font>

1137
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:38,800
the time with new people question

1138
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,799
everything

1139
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:42,010
assumptions most importantly your

1140
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:48,100
clients statements what they want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1141
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:51,700
find have standard practices when you do

1142
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:54,009
stuff for example CP<font color="#CCCCCC"> build an operation</font>

1143
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:56,740
understand document your operations

1144
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:58,540
write this stuff out we image the mat we

1145
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,370
did this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure that they tell you in</font>

1146
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:02,890
the forensics courses keep good notes

1147
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:05,500
they also should be telling you to build

1148
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:08,170
standard methods so that you do the same

1149
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:09,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing every time the consistency will</font>

1150
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:13,840
make you faster the speed will let you

1151
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:15,820
work more and get more done make sure

1152
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:18,010
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're reliable methods every now</font>

1153
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:19,990
and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> stumble upon things that's</font>

1154
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:21,670
not a reliable method that's I got lucky

1155
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:31,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">and found the file</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was looking for</font>

1156
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:33,280
always have positive proof leave the

1157
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:34,690
conclusions to the lawyers when you're

1158
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:38,230
writing your reports about this stuff

1159
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:41,560
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> draw conclusions you draw</font>

1160
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:45,730
statements you say we found this it

1161
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:47,920
indicates<font color="#E5E5E5"> this does it prove that that's</font>

00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:49,300
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem your problem is to</font>

1163
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:54,370
present it to the lawyer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and let them</font>

1164
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:55,840
deal with that part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it on the witness</font>

1165
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:57,850
stand they will try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and back you into</font>

1166
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:04,560
corners on this stuff it's lots of fun

1167
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:04,560
to deal with always remember yes

1168
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:14,760
only in very strange and extreme

1169
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:16,440
circumstances normally all of that goes

1170
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,480
to be work product for the lawyers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1171
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,849
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not admissible they can't be done</font>

1172
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,069
anything entitled to see it which is why

1173
00:57:20,849 --> 00:57:24,810
you always work for a lawyer if your

1174
00:57:23,069 --> 00:57:26,069
buddy that owns an auto<font color="#E5E5E5"> body shop comes</font>

1176
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:29,339
some forensics work I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

1177
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:31,319
employees are stealing the next phrase

1178
00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:34,380
out of your mouth would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay who's</font>

1179
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:35,579
your lawyer which he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to like</font>

1180
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,990
because it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cost them a lot of</font>

1181
00:57:35,579 --> 00:57:38,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">money but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you always work through</font>

lawyers unless you work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the state in</font>

1183
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,910
which case you are the lawyer you just

1184
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:45,089
on the other side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the table but</font>

1185
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:49,890
always work for lawyers that way your

1186
00:57:45,089 --> 00:57:51,930
stuffs not admissible that way they are

1187
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:55,078
responsible not you you're only

1188

responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you do we</font>

1190
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:06,180
Philadelphia a few years<font color="#CCCCCC"> back where some</font>

1191
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:08,670
people in the government were embezzling

1192
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:11,759
money they were embezzling a lot of

1193
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:14,730
money over a lot of years it was in

1194
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:18,210
excess of 50 million dollars over the

1195
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:20,550
course of a decade and there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

1196
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:24,450
of nepotism involved it was a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> broad</font>

1197
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:26,520
forensics effort we ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up going into</font>

1198
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:28,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">a building and basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seizing most of</font>

1199
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,730
the computers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the building and doing</font>

1200

our imaging and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth</font>

00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:38,190
working through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lawyers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of course</font>

1202
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:40,680
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that came up there</font>

1203
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:42,869
when we started was do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

1204
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,339
warrant because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were working for the</font>

1205
00:58:42,869 --> 00:58:47,220
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the table that needs a warrant</font>

1206
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:48,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do things and their response is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1207
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:50,609
city government we're the city

1208
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:53,160
government it's in our authority to do

1209
00:58:50,609 --> 00:58:54,480
this just go do it so they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1210
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:58,410
without a written warrant from a judge

1211
00:58:54,480 --> 00:59:00,270
which I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that's legal or</font>

1212
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,410
not not my<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is the lower problem</font>

1213
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:03,509
but it was one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that came</font>

1214
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:06,089
up so if you're doing stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1215
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:07,589
involves lawyers it's their problem not

1216
00:59:06,089 --> 00:59:09,869
yours which is another great reason for

1217
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:14,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing it if your buddy wants you to</font>

1218
00:59:09,869 --> 00:59:16,250
check his employees laptop for whatever

1219
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:19,460
should you do that

1220
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:20,690
no you should not do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you</font>

1221
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:24,470
have no right to look at another

00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:28,430
the school brings you a student's laptop

1224
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:31,220
and after you to look for stuff on it

1225
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:32,779
you say no I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have a right to</font>

1226
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:34,009
search the other students laptop the

1227
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:35,690
same thing holds in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business world</font>

1228
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:38,030
and everywhere else unless you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1229
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:42,380
right to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't do it</font>

1230
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:45,410
it's a crime so don't always have

1231
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:47,600
lawyers that's their job in life let

1232
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:48,680
them take the responsibility to finish

1233
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,089
out the story though so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

1234
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:53,810

years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is why having people that</font>

are old on your team is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very useful we</font>

the financial started we know that

1240
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,010
they've been changing data in the

1241
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,770
database because we have the old copy

1242
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:09,650
and we have the new copy but we don't

1243
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:13,910
know when it began they had changed

1244

servers from novell a few years<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier</font>

1246
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:24,260
behold the novell 2.2 server that they

1247
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:26,180
had been running on for like 15 years or

1248
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:28,610
something and it had the original copy

1249
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:29,960
of most of the database everything that

1250
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:31,430
hadn't been updated in 10 years and

1251
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's word and we were able to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

1252
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:35,149
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been 10 years and 50 million</font>

1253
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:36,440

01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:38,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the government that were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> responsible</font>

1255
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:46,790
for making sure that those people paid

1256
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:48,980
for their crimes and they said thanks we

1257
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:50,570
don't need that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to use</font>

1258
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:52,370
it to pressure some people politically

1259
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:54,530
and get them out of office and so the

1260
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:57,859
regime in Philadelphia changed hands and

1261
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:59,990
nobody went to jail<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later</font>

feds show up and the FBI goes in does

1266
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:11,120
the exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing we did seize all</font>

1267
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:12,710
the computers they start imaging and we

1268
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:15,589
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we saw it in the</font>

1269
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:18,440
newspaper and we said we all know that's

1270
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:19,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">not admissible right and then that was</font>

1271
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,890
the end of it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> never heard another</font>

01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:23,470
thing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it after</font>

1273
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:26,049
so the government intentionally screwed

1274
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:28,390
up a case it involves a large amount of

1275
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:31,060
money tax dollars and then walked away

1276
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:32,650
from it and then they showed up again

1277
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:34,060
and realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they had screwed up</font>

1278
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:35,920
that it wasn't their responsibility so

1279
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:37,990
that it didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1280
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:41,470
maybe some<font color="#E5E5E5"> FBI got a promotion out of it</font>

1281
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:43,060
or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's why you need a</font>

1282
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:44,230
lawyer<font color="#E5E5E5"> that understands what you're</font>

situations like that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not left</font>

1285
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:51,250
hanging it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just as easily well</font>

1286
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:53,920
they're the ones that image this stuff

1287
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:55,240
go talk to them but<font color="#CCCCCC"> nobody ever did and</font>

1288
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,710
it could have blamed us for corrupting

1289
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,629
the evidence which we would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

1290
01:01:56,710 --> 01:02:00,100
defensible because we know with our

1291
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:02,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">lawyers what we can do and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't</font>

1292
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:07,180
do but still nothing ever came of it

1293
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:08,500
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> bummed that was also when we</font>

1294
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:14,259
figured out how to image like a hundred

1295
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:17,380
computers in the day back on negative

1296
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:19,960
proof so we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this earlier</font>

1297
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:21,580
there's no bash history file what's the

next place you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at to</font>

1299
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:35,470
figure out what's been going on on the

01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:36,700
computer system file there might be

1301
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:42,939
stuff in the trash can if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're lucky</font>

1302
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:44,560

actions either you've got the file and

1304
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:49,779
it has bad infinite got the file and

1305
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:51,430
there's no badness in it and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

bad things again about<font color="#CCCCCC"> bausch history is</font>

1307
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:56,770
that you can edit it so you can do bad

1308
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:58,180
things go in edit the file save it and

1309
01:02:56,770 --> 01:03:00,130
there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be no evidence that you did</font>

1310
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:01,990
things I can't even<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell from just</font>

1311
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:03,910
looking at that so that the file has

1312
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:09,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">been edited but if I go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

1313

01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:17,049
it's not present it's not recoverable

1315
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:19,029
it's no use bad guys are not super

1316
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:20,350
genius as though if you can't find

1317
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:21,820
something chances are there's still

1318
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:23,589
something else on that system that will

1319
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:25,090
tell you if they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually using it</font>

documentation was almost non-existent up

until a couple years ago I think there

1352
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:14,359
were three books<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it the rest of the</font>

1405
01:07:25,269 --> 01:07:29,379
when it's changed that's how you find

1406
01:07:27,819 --> 01:07:31,960
the stuff because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not documented</font>

1407
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:33,250
anywhere every case is different every

01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:35,380
tool is different the last one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:40,240
worked from California with the great

<font color="#E5E5E5">garbage out there free VPN I mean</font>

1413
01:07:49,809 --> 01:07:54,190
there's thousands of them I used one

1414

while I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was on vacation down in the</font>

1415
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:57,700

01:07:59,319 --> 01:08:05,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dominican which is Spanish in a way but</font>

1419
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:07,118
not either<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I wasn't getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1420
01:08:05,049 --> 01:08:08,559
results that I wanted but a VPN pointed

01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:11,559
back in<font color="#E5E5E5"> America and you can set it to</font>

01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:13,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever location you want we'll get you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">into the right area so you're going to</font>

1424
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:17,889
use VPNs when you're traveling except in

1425
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:19,839
China because they'll knock on your door

1426
01:08:17,889 --> 01:08:26,889
and ask you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave that's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

1427
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:28,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">story but we were talking about tools</font>

1428
01:08:26,889 --> 01:08:30,370
since every tool is different and they

1429
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:33,370
all do different things that's why I

1430
01:08:30,370 --> 01:08:35,290
emphasize learning how to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1431
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:38,130
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> because next year will be</font>

1432
01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:38,130
different tools yes

1433
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:54,500
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

1434
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:56,810
the level of documentation increasing or

1435
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:59,270
decreasing or staying the same it's

1436
01:08:56,810 --> 01:09:00,920
gotten better it's not gotten to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1437
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:03,350
point where everything I need to know is

1438
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:08,899
documented and when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to</font>

1439
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:11,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-party apps never never you're</font>

1440
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:12,559
better better better luck with Microsoft

1441
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:14,270
than you or some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the third party apps</font>

1442
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,580
but ironically some of the small

1443
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:19,910
developers are better at debugging and

1444
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:24,080
keeping logs<font color="#E5E5E5"> than Microsoft is every</font>

1445
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:25,370
case is different when and when someone

1446
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,630
tells you that in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case you're going to have to install</font>

1449
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:33,229
the whole concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of disposable systems</font>

1450
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:36,019
that you can test with comes into play

1451
01:09:33,229 --> 01:09:37,429
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nice things about Max that</font>

1452

again as a failure<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the windows side</font>

1453
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:41,870
of things is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can clone this</font>

1455

again a Mac spent on apple doesn't care

1456
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:48,920
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a clean development system</font>

1457

when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy your Mac for example clone</font>

1459
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:55,220
is cheap disk is so cheap there's no

1460
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:57,170
excuse for not having three or four

production<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk or at least</font>

1466
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:11,150
disconnecting it because some bad

1467
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:14,660
software will do things to anything it

1468
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:17,839
can find but having that clean copy is

1469
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:19,099
critical to doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> OSX forensics because</font>

what it does to your system and you're

silicon that cost twenty dollars and

1478
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:37,010
then you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a disc that you can play</font>

direct comparisons back to using<font color="#CCCCCC"> x-rays</font>

1484
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:48,920
and scripting we can fire stuff up over

here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then have the script run and</font>

gather the results for us we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1490
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:00,920
because it's better than we are software

1491
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:02,840
doesn't make mistakes unless you tell it

or you source it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> China</font>

1494
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:17,800
a point about processing cases like this

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know but it's a lawful long time so</font>

01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:30,039
when you're working through it and you

can<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally come across teddy bear in</font>

1503
01:11:34,449 --> 01:11:39,039
if it's part of your your case sequence

1504
01:11:36,639 --> 01:11:40,840
so you've got to set up your boot drives

1505
01:11:39,039 --> 01:11:42,369
do all this stuff in Salt City where

1506
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:45,639
look at the difference do the analysis

1507
01:11:42,369 --> 01:11:47,320
and write up some sort of finding we did

1508
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:49,179
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what it means we did this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this is what it did because you're going</font>

lawyers that's what we built for but

1512
01:11:51,789 --> 01:11:55,030
it's going to take you about a day to do

1513
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:56,589
every question so the further this

1514
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:58,840
progresses the more expensive it gets

1515
01:11:56,590 --> 01:12:00,280
for the lawyers that's why it coming

1516
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:02,139
back to the what we talked about in the

1517
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:05,829
beginning was scoping is so important

1518
01:12:02,139 --> 01:12:07,090
flying blind going in black box on these

things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not knowing what you're</font>

1520
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:10,929
looking for means you cannot tell the

1521
01:12:08,889 --> 01:12:12,880
lawyer how much it's going to cost which

1522
01:12:10,929 --> 01:12:15,280
is fine when the client is a fortune 500

1523
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:17,770
company if they have bottomless pits of

1524
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:20,349
money but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very bad when it's the</font>

that you have to ask a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

1530
01:12:28,179 --> 01:12:37,119
that scoping becomes very important when

01:12:31,179 --> 01:12:38,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">it comes to third-party software what</font>

between the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those if they haven't</font>

1539

erased everything you can build a pretty

1540
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:57,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">complete picture of everything that's</font>

happened on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our machine</font>

1542
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:11,540
and is what I just talked about cool the

1543
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,160
simplest way to find out what the app is

1544
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:14,630
doing when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does it's thing is to run</font>

1545
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:18,080
it and just look for the recent<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes</font>

1546
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:19,850
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> frame that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used it that</font>

1547
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:22,460
shows you not only what the app did it

1548
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:24,050
shows you what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system did so when</font>

1549
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:26,120
you fire up teddy bear and it goes out

1550
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:28,580
in ping servers in Russia and China

1551
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:35,059
Vietnam and Canada all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will</font>

1552
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:43,880
become<font color="#E5E5E5"> readily apparent here is an</font>

1553
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:46,040
example of one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that we all</font>

1554
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:51,309
I did was open<font color="#E5E5E5"> Safari and shut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it down</font>

1555
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:55,599
and it changed the<font color="#CCCCCC"> history five times</font>

1556
01:13:51,309 --> 01:14:01,749
that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right I circle the wrong one</font>

now<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of them is different local</font>

1561
01:14:12,519 --> 01:14:18,939
fired up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and change that we would go</font>

trainers from manufacturers and then

1581
01:15:07,449 --> 01:15:12,608
there's forms of strangeness like SB

1584
01:15:15,129 --> 01:15:19,749
on for the case so I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I looked</font>

1585
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:21,609
at it the problem with again looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

answers with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google is that you're going</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">later what happens when you go to the</font>

1589
01:15:25,629 --> 01:15:34,739
Ukraine you become a botnet you become a

1590
01:15:31,929 --> 01:15:34,739
node<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the botnet</font>

1591
01:15:37,130 --> 01:15:42,469
which brings us to how you go about

1592
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:44,959
doing all of this stuff and operating<font color="#CCCCCC"> xq</font>

1593
01:15:42,469 --> 01:15:48,590
this is a fellow at<font color="#E5E5E5"> sands very smart guy</font>

1594
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:51,320
and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> has this saying called hack naked</font>

1595
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:53,000
that comes about because when you're

1596
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:54,349
doing your red team stuff in particular

1597
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,230
when you're doing port scanning and so

1598
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:58,550
on when you're sniffing when you're

1599
01:15:57,230 --> 01:16:00,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to do things that involve the</font>

filtering between you and the target you

1602
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:06,230
are not one can get the true picture so

1603
01:16:04,699 --> 01:16:07,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to shut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off your antivirus or</font>

1604
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:09,888
firewall all that kind of garbage and

1605
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:12,888
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to know if your ISP is blocking</font>

1606
01:16:09,889 --> 01:16:16,909
anything almost all ISPs block something

1607
01:16:12,889 --> 01:16:18,170
very hard to find pure data now if yours

1608
01:16:16,909 --> 01:16:20,059
don't the ones that the other end

1609
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:21,409
problem we do so you can't throw

1610
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:23,480
Christmas tree packets across the

1611
01:16:21,409 --> 01:16:25,610
network anymore like you used to because

1612
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:28,009
it gets dropped fragmented packets get

1613
01:16:25,610 --> 01:16:29,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">dropped every router in between can see</font>

1614
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:35,030
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fragmented packet why would it</font>

1615
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:37,130
pass it on coming back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the VPN the</font>

1616

VPN of choice for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of this stuff is</font>

1618
01:16:39,409 --> 01:16:46,219
and network anybody use net cat and a

1619
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:52,790
cat very simple program very elegant

1620

does is throw a pipe wonderful thing but

1622
01:16:56,360 --> 01:17:03,019
it passes everything including broken

1623
01:16:58,130 --> 01:17:04,250
packets the opposite<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that is when</font>

1624
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:05,239
you're doing your forensic stuff like

1625
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:06,710
when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going and looking at the</font>

1638
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:43,300
bad stuff out there and it works very

1639
01:17:34,190 --> 01:18:13,389
fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey thank you</font>

come on what I'm Alexa losing 70 that is

1641
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:17,050
the last slide I didn't buy a slide on

1642
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:21,160
here that says yeah thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> for attending</font>

1643
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:25,330
and so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have ample</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time for</font>

1644
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:27,309
questions supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to three I will</font>

1645
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:39,250
come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the beginning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for you guys</font>

1646
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:41,590
after answer questions yes I choose the

1647
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:44,590
disk utility on Mac well actually I

1648
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:47,320
cheat get a part and<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a bigger one in</font>

1649
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:49,090
anyways so since I have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the</font>

1650
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:51,280
box<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the hardware to</font>

like that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah the stuff that's</font>

1653
01:18:55,150 --> 01:19:05,059
built in works fine DCF<font color="#E5E5E5"> ldd is linux</font>

others

1655

pardon a lot it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on which plist</font>

potential to be have gaps but the OS is

1664
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:50,010
going to contain pretty much everything

1665

1674
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:16,170
plist stuff does go away some things it

1675
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:19,710
only keeps like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current instance of</font>

1676
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:22,380
but other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things it's a log and you'll</font>

1677
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:24,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">have like like the duck or the image</font>

1678
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:34,080
database it's just a continually

1679
01:20:24,449 --> 01:20:35,669
expanding log of stuff powder I don't

1680
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:37,590
know if there's a format limit to any of

1681
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:41,550
them there's different types and some of

1682
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:43,199
them probably have a limitation but the

1683
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:46,020
ones that are sequel like tables now

1684
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:47,759
theoretically there's naught but a lot

1685
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:54,360
of the stuff just doesn't keep entries

1686
01:20:47,760 --> 01:21:12,179
poke around go look at them

1687
01:20:54,360 --> 01:21:14,909
difficulties that we've encountered in

1688
01:21:12,179 --> 01:21:17,760
the process with OSX include things like

1689
01:21:14,909 --> 01:21:19,920
the plist and determining what it is

1690
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:22,440
you're looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the lack of</font>

1691
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:25,080
documentation for specific aspects of it

1692
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:26,940
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might be able to get documentation</font>

1693
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:30,960
out of Apple<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says yes this feature</font>

1694
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:32,730
produces this plist like safari in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1695
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:35,280
history list or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that but</font>

1696
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:36,959
i can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find documentation about details</font>

1697
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:38,759
in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to figure out</font>

1698
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,530
what the codes in the fields are like

1699
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:44,460
for example the directory structure that

1700
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:46,679
we use to get at the history database

1701
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:49,380
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ex action and the 30 digits or</font>

1702
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:51,449
the 30 alphanumerics there's no

1703
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:54,989
documentation on why that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what it is</font>

1704
01:21:51,449 --> 01:21:58,110
it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> random but we know that Z Z is</font>

1705
01:21:54,989 --> 01:22:02,099
root and the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them seem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go in</font>

1706
01:21:58,110 --> 01:22:03,929
sequence a a a B AC ad like that so that

1707
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:05,940
nice two digit one is predictable and

1708
01:22:03,929 --> 01:22:08,070
fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy so if you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the system</font>

1709
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:09,388
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you've got ZZ and bf you know</font>

1710
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:13,409
there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of users erased on</font>

1711
01:22:09,389 --> 01:22:15,030
that machine but when it comes to the 30

1712
01:22:13,409 --> 01:22:18,690
digit I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just random and</font>

1713
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:20,610
then when it comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to other things that</font>

1714
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:22,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">the OS does there may or may not be</font>

1715
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:24,929
information available and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1716
01:22:22,679 --> 01:22:27,389
build time figuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> out why it is or ask</font>

1717
01:22:24,929 --> 01:22:29,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions from the community as to why</font>

1718
01:22:27,389 --> 01:22:32,280
it is and people specialize in this

1719
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:37,409
stuff I'm a generalist so my take on a

1720
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:39,719
lot of this is fairly shallow and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1721
01:22:37,409 --> 01:22:42,330
people that do specific presentations on

1722
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:44,010
individual topics which is what all you

1723
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:45,570
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do right come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back in a</font>

1724
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:47,699
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years or it next year and do a</font>

1725
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:49,920
presentation on a specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspect of it</font>

1726
01:22:47,699 --> 01:22:53,820
that nobody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> has done because that's</font>

1727
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:55,650
a great job resume item<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did this and</font>

1728
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:57,449
it's gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4,000 hits on YouTube which</font>

1729
01:22:55,650 --> 01:23:00,059
for the forensics community is a big

1730
01:22:57,449 --> 01:23:03,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal if everybody's looked at your video</font>

1731
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:07,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you did something right</font>

1732
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:08,720
and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of it and one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1733
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:11,570
problems again with the community<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1734
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:14,870
with the field in general is if things

1735
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:16,160
change so fast there's always material

1736
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:17,599
that needs to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> looked at there's</font>

1737
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:20,059
always information that you can be

1738
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:21,860
sharing and discovering so you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

1739
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:23,570
the employment opportunities you've got

1740
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:27,200
the ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to your</font>

1741
01:23:23,570 --> 01:23:29,450
advantage you just have to go do it we

1742
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:31,130
could spend an account<font color="#CCCCCC"> 'less amount of</font>

1743
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:33,740
time on<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost anything you could do an</font>

1744
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:35,780
entire two-hour person<font color="#E5E5E5"> tasting just on</font>

1745
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:38,210
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> P lists and the various problems</font>

1746
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:41,540
with those and you still<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't get</font>

1747
01:23:38,210 --> 01:23:44,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">into all of them but that would be</font>

1748
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:48,890
looked at very favorably and get you

1749
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:57,680
probably a job more so<font color="#CCCCCC"> than being in the</font>

1750
01:23:48,890 --> 01:24:01,550
Chess Club that's for sure yes black

1751
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:02,900
bite I got black light I'm not sure if I

1752
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:07,030
have my other<font color="#E5E5E5"> plist tool on this</font>

1753
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:07,030
computer let's see

1754
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:19,820
with it yes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get a trial edition</font>

1755
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:23,180
I believe but it is a for free

1756
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:25,460
application it's not terribly cheap it's

1757
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:28,670
not terribly expensive either it's less

1758
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:31,520
than in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> of purchasing power your</font>

1759
01:24:28,670 --> 01:24:35,780
number one opportunity is x<font color="#E5E5E5"> rays which I</font>

1760
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:40,040
think those p lists now x rays is fairly

1761
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:42,050
inexpensive i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say less</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than a</font>

1762
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:48,800
thousand might be a thousand and

1763
01:24:42,050 --> 01:24:52,100
backlight is about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2200 and then ftk is</font>

1764
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:54,860
about 2,800 and then there's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1765
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:59,150
garbage utility that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very expensive</font>

1766
01:24:54,860 --> 01:25:01,190
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> four grand and ftk also has the</font>

1767
01:24:59,150 --> 01:25:03,559
cheapest education materials it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

1768
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:05,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">eight hundred bucks so for the price for</font>

1769
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:09,350
less than you'll pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> fpk you can get</font>

1770
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:22,849
x-rays<font color="#E5E5E5"> and training and there's some</font>

1771
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:30,320
material out there available yes I don't

1772
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:34,160
know there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information about</font>

1773
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:38,480
did this particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac connect to that</font>

1774
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:39,830
particular song that's easy but details

1775
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:42,980
about things that they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1776
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:45,230
information that they shared like for

1777
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:48,530
example if you've got clash of clans on

1778
01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:50,540
your phone and you connect it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

1779
01:25:48,530 --> 01:25:52,550
has a connection to the internet does

1780
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:54,500
clash of clans send any data at that

1781
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:55,550
point I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no one's ever I don't</font>

1782
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,390
know if anybody's ever looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1783
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:59,660
but that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the same for</font>

1784
01:25:56,390 --> 01:26:02,540
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single application we know the</font>

1785
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:05,960
phone send stuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have never gone</font>

1786
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:08,780
looking for the specifics in that other

1787
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:10,970
than was this phone connected today and

1788
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:12,920
were their files on this phone that

1789
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:14,480
wound up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this computer or that they</font>

1790
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:22,010
viewed that's the extent of my

1791
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:22,980
involvement with that piece love the

1792
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:35,520
piano he was

1793
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:37,259
yeah it's just tedious there's freeware

1794
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:40,110
utilities and it's built into the

1795
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:42,060
operators if that's what you're after in

1796
01:26:40,110 --> 01:26:43,980
terms of wires are they're inexpensive

1797
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:45,960
tools there's plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of free tools out</font>

1798
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:54,839
there no that's what I was coming to

1799
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:58,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">look for when we need to DT TV do I</font>

1800
01:26:54,840 --> 01:27:01,860
haven't yeah I use plist edit pro oops I

1801
01:26:58,110 --> 01:27:05,759
guess we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at it new</font>

1802
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:08,400
version is available and it's yeah it's

1803
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:26,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">just an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> XML markup thing so it's pretty</font>

1804
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:28,799
pumped yeah yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> us do forensic do these</font>

1805
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:35,430
forensics tools look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple's new file</font>

1806
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:38,040
system yes they do oh I know why you're

1807
01:27:35,430 --> 01:27:41,070
asking that yeah i think the pain in the

1808
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:42,450
butt<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not a fan but I</font>

1809
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:43,620
that's dealing with it at gos level

1810
01:27:42,450 --> 01:27:46,550
dealing with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> front annex level it's</font>

1811
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:46,550
just another good source

1812
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:55,500
we come across encrypted systems all the

1813
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:58,140
time how do you decrypt them you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1814
01:27:55,500 --> 01:28:03,420
you get the key if they won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you</font>

1815
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:05,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">the key to go to jail that's the only</font>

1816
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:05,690
way in

1817
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:19,700
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure what you're asking if if</font>

1818
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:22,010
there's two reasons you're looking at an

1819
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:23,450
encrypted files with them one the owner

1820
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:25,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">wants you to look at it in which case</font>

1821
01:28:23,450 --> 01:28:28,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">they are entitled to the key</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

1822
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:31,129
can compel the user to give them the key

1823
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:32,990
and then give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to you or you are a</font>

1824
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:34,640
criminal investigator and the

1825
01:28:32,990 --> 01:28:37,130
perpetrator does not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you</font>

1826
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:39,560
the key and you can currently compel

1827
01:28:37,130 --> 01:28:41,570
them to give them give you the key or at

1828
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:44,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">least make them very uncomfortable so</font>

1829
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:47,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will give you the key but</font>

1830
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:48,500
there are there's two guys in jail right

1831
01:28:47,090 --> 01:28:50,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">now that refuse to cough up the keys</font>

1832
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:51,950
they're in jail they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in jail</font>

1833
01:28:50,630 --> 01:28:53,210
because they committed a crime they're

1834
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:55,599
in jail because they refuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give up</font>

1835
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:55,600
the keys

1836
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:15,200
yes because the court is looking at you

1837
01:29:13,670 --> 01:29:17,240
for some particular reason that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll</font>

1838
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:20,210
care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the intellectual property it</font>

1839
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:22,099
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the secret to coke the secret</font>

1840
01:29:20,210 --> 01:29:24,740
ingredients in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Coke and he still have to</font>

1841
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:26,270
give up the key and that's cokes problem

1842
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:30,800
they can have a lawyer president that

1843
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:33,260
comes down to that there is some

1844
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:37,100
interesting case activity on that

1845
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:41,690
because what's in the system becomes

1846
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:44,210
legal and it may be relevant to the case

1847
01:29:41,690 --> 01:29:46,460
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they were moving that</font>

1848
01:29:44,210 --> 01:29:48,980
secret to China for production that was

1849
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:51,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys crime was about the</font>

1850
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:55,959
intellectual property those cases

1851
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:55,960
outward

1852
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:09,120
seeing one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those there's an operating</font>

1853
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:18,419
system that requires multiple people to

1854
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:20,340
decrypt ok that's an application a

1855
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:36,150
specific application<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a feature</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1856
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:36,990
that app that's not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> LS are you</font>

1857
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:56,429
talking about their individual

1858
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:58,110
directories<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh the boot feature yeah it</font>

1859
01:30:56,430 --> 01:31:01,170
hasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> come up in any of our cases yet</font>

1860
01:30:58,110 --> 01:31:02,670
but i would think that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

1861
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:04,500
your key because you're being compelled

1862
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:07,350
it will not decrypt the information on

1863
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:09,690
the computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're using went with</font>

1864
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:14,550
your key<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think but i haven't</font>

1865
01:31:09,690 --> 01:31:16,169
looked at it but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> LS will let you get</font>

1866
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:17,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">it the other portions of the disk even</font>

1867
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:32,460
if you didn't put in the other person's

1868
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:34,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">key thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple cool I don't know we</font>

1869
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:36,180
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> these things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we say it's</font>

1870
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:37,440
encrypted and give us the key and they

1871
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:39,420
give us the key and that's pretty much

1872
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:42,299
our limit the technical details of how

1873
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:44,370
the thing works that's great for people

1874
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:46,530
that are working in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that specific field</font>

1875
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:48,300
but for most of us we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to know</font>

1876
01:31:46,530 --> 01:31:50,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sort of thing that's almost like</font>

1877
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:51,690
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the math aspects of it is</font>

1878
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:53,070
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> does the encryption work the</font>

1879
01:31:51,690 --> 01:31:55,710
different pieces you'll never have to

1880
01:31:53,070 --> 01:31:57,690
explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in court not at that level</font>

1881
01:31:55,710 --> 01:32:00,020
something's gone drastically wrong if

1882
01:31:57,690 --> 01:32:00,019
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening</font>

1883
01:32:06,559 --> 01:32:13,030
and the others<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so back here you</font>

where to put

1886
