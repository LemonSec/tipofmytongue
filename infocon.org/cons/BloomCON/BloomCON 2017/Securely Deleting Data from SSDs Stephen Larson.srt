00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:31,810
working now got it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hi how y'all are</font>

2
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,420
sorry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'll mute next time I</font>

3
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:38,860
got a cough my name is steve larson

4
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:41,230
sorry for my voice I've coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> off of</font>

5
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:44,110
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flu I'm not contagious anymore so</font>

6
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:47,319
don't worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

7
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:50,379
tell you how<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to make an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive</font>

8
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,960
paper weight out of your SSD or how to

9
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:58,839
make one I don't know first of all I've

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:03,280
got a disclaimer neither am i that's my

11
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:08,619
disclaimer so and you'll see why later

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay we'll talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about data</font>

13
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:13,450
erasing fundamentals for those of you

14
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:15,580
that don't know much about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and then</font>

15
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,940
we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about the issues</font>

16
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,679
that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> with racing SSDs so we know</font>

17
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:24,070
that deletion of data doesn't mean it's

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:26,920
going to be destroyed right if you pick

19
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:29,199
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> a book this is what I i tell my intro</font>

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">peep my intro students and we imagine</font>

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this is a book when I'm erasing a</font>

22
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:37,660
file out of the book what am i<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:42,340
find me racing a chapter and it was a

24
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:44,950
hard drive yeah in other words all i'm

25
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:48,640
doing is i'm taking the entry out of the

26
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:50,200
table<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> contents well actually i'm not</font>

27
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">even doing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm just making it so</font>

28
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,950
it's not it doesn't appear<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the OS</font>

29
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,540
right so taking it out so the OS can't

30
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,300
see it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to format the drive</font>

31
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting rid of all of the list</font>

32
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the files that are on the drag but</font>

33
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,830
all the data is still there no matter

34
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">what right and the text is still there</font>

35
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,190
on the book of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess so we know</font>

36
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,630
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff doesn't work so</font>

37
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:11,590
generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do is we wipe a hard</font>

38
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:16,659
drive and who can tell me what wiping a

39
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,890
hard drive means i can pick on somebody

40
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:24,100
from slippery rock university that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

41
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:31,420
know knows it yes sir I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry</font>

42
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:33,400
that you overwrite every single bit on

43
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,429
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk right with some kind of random</font>

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:41,200
0 or 1 or something yeah and that way we

45
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:45,370
can't get the data back yes sir I don't

46
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what your record I'm not coming</font>

47
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:54,400
through on video well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's</font>

48
00:02:47,470 --> 00:03:00,280
pointing way up here Oh in Miami HDMI

49
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:03,340
know i'm i'm a vga<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay when it comes to</font>

50
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,600
SSDs we have a different technology so

51
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,950
we gotta use different methods and

52
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,519
sometimes we don't know what's inside

53
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,709
the black box so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all know about hard</font>

54
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,110
drives these are spinning platters that

55
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:16,480
we all use and all up to you you know

56
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:19,030
the OS has direct access to writing to

57
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,160
the hard drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can say go to this</font>

58
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:25,540
address on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk and write this text</font>

59
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,950
there's no real state for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the page you</font>

60
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,829
know all we have is reading right we

61
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:32,019
really don't have a delete on there when

62
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:38,410
it comes to SSDs the OS does not have

63
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:39,880
direct access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pages and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then we</font>

64
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:44,710
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're leveling issue that we'll</font>

65
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:47,829
talk about later on and each cell has a

66
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:49,840
state to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so manned memory which</font>

67
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">is what insight what's inside SSDs has</font>

68
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,280
three operations we have the read

69
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:58,450
operations the right operations<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

70
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,070
erase operation when we write<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

71
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,869
block form SSDs that it can only be

72
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,640
written once if you're going to override

73
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,340
then of course you have to completely

74
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,679
erase it and then be rewritten and a

75
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:13,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">blocker a page has a state it's either</font>

76
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:15,850
programmed or is he raised they're

77
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,399
organized into blocks you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> off with</font>

78
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:20,890
all bits set to<font color="#E5E5E5"> one so everything on the</font>

79
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,049
on the SSD is set to one<font color="#E5E5E5"> at sea or a</font>

80
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,360
state when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> write a block</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you set the</font>

81
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,920
necessary that's 20 and then you get

82
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,170
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> zeros and ones and so now we have</font>

83
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,350
our data and now we're in a program

84
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:34,120
state and we can read that block

85
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:37,360
repeatedly we can read it all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time</font>

86
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,080
anything we want to do unfortunately

87
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,270
reading it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

88
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:51,250
many times will cause problems with the

89
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:55,389
nearby block why is that who here knows

90
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,889
about static electricity yeah do you

91
00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:01,780
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> being shocked by static electricity</font>

92
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:04,000
no why<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it doesn't hurt a little bit</font>

93
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,188
here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's temporary right</font>

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,669
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> zeros don't like it why is</font>

95
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:11,710
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> might change the state right</font>

96
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:13,030
you get electrical shock here and it

97
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,138
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurt here a little bit or</font>

98
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,750
something like that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

99
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:19,300
nervous system so that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> closest we</font>

100
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,219
can come to why we're shooting electrons

101
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,009
at these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change their state and</font>

102
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:27,490
the nearby cells that are getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> shot</font>

103
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:30,610
might start to affect might start to be

104
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:32,379
affected so you know we're SSD is a

105
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,360
little bit more complicated than hard

106
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:37,389
disk drives one way you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> update</font>

107
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,550
even just one little bit in an SSD we

108
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:42,370
have to first erase the entire block so

109
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:44,440
we copy everything into<font color="#CCCCCC"> ram FST ram many</font>

110
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:47,560
we erase the entire block and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we</font>

111
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,849
rewrite the whole thing there's a 50-50

112
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,879
chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you only have to put in a</font>

113
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:54,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero but if even one little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

114
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:55,719
entire block goes from 0 to 1 then we

115
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,599
got to read the entire block into<font color="#CCCCCC"> ram</font>

116
00:05:55,719 --> 00:06:01,870
update it erase the block and rewrite

117
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:04,180
the block<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay on these program erase</font>

118
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:07,120
icon can only happen a certain number

119
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before they wear out it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

120
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,990
like if you get that little static

121
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:12,849
electricity shock pretty soon the little

122
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,529
nerve ending in your skin that's

123
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:16,180
receiving that shock is going to wear

124
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:17,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">out right it's going to get numb</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

125
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:22,839
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to feel the shock game</font>

126
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:24,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">or so it's kind of useless and also some</font>

127
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:26,409
songs today to get updated more

128
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:28,509
frequently than ours there are certain

129
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:30,639
files that we use on a daily basis that

130
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:32,469
get updated all the time every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

131
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,589
press ctrl s to save something then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

132
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:36,879
know the file gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> updated and then</font>

133
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:38,860
there's some data<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we don't update</font>

134
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:42,639
hardly at all I when was last time you

135
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:45,669
change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> JPEG I don't remember last</font>

136
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,420
time I change<font color="#E5E5E5"> one right every cell in</font>

137
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:54,320
the SSD

138
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:56,840
every cell in the SSD has a certain

139
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,480
number of program erase cycles that it

140
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,969
can go through before it's worn out and

141
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,010
when it does we reach we have our mean

142
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,110
time between<font color="#CCCCCC"> failure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> level that's marked</font>

143
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:08,210
on to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it says left you know</font>

144
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">before we fail we want to write this</font>

145
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">someplace else oh so then it will put it</font>

146
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:15,140
someplace else on the SSD because of

147
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:18,350
this manufacturers have we're leveling

148
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:20,300
and they also do over-provisioning so

149
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:23,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're the leveling is we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

150
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:27,380
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the SSD doesn't get worn out</font>

151
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:29,659
in any particular cell so in other words

152
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:34,159
if we can write something to sell a

153
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:35,510
100,000 times cell a2 has nothing then

154
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,630
sell a one's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out quicker</font>

155
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:40,250
than cell a2 so we don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

156
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,230
happen so we put this we're leveling and

157
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:46,280
and what that does is it means you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

158
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:52,190
data is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> all over the place excuse</font>

159
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:58,940
me I<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta numb up my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> throat here well</font>

160
00:07:52,190 --> 00:08:05,330
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't talk ah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lovelady right</font>

161
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:06,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a cell gets</font>

162
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,990
rewritten too many times<font color="#CCCCCC"> read</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the mean</font>

163
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,000
time between failure and we write the

164
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:13,700
contents of that cell someplace else and

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,130
we mark that cell as or its block as

166
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:19,219
don't use now does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this cause a drive to</font>

167
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:24,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">get smaller over time you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so right</font>

168
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:26,630
does it because anybody notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> their SSD</font>

169
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,310
the available state I know the available

170
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:30,320
space gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> march mama does anybody</font>

171
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">notice that their disk it gets smaller</font>

172
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:38,659
is anything report<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it gets smaller</font>

173
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:40,250
not really i don't think the firmware

174
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:42,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">lets it happen right if the firmware</font>

175
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,330
doesn't tell us by the way you know

176
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,949
you've now got<font color="#E5E5E5"> 17 blocks mark bad and</font>

177
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,800
you now have one megabyte less on your

178
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:51,410
hard drive right we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thing</font>

179
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,540
called over-provisioning in SSDs and

180
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:56,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'll show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you a different graphic on it</font>

181
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,699
later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on but basically because this</font>

182
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,219
we're leveling and cells can wear out

183
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:04,550
they add between seven and twenty

184
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:08,720
sent more space in your SSD then if then

185
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:09,859
is advertised because if we mark it bad

186
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,470
we don't want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think you're</font>

187
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:15,350
running out of space so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got a 64</font>

188
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,870
gigabyte SSD here as you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell it's</font>

189
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:21,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">not as new as we would like it's a</font>

190
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:24,410
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit older model but that means it</font>

191
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,899
could have you know up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what one-fifth</font>

192
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:33,139
right what's one-fifth 12 12 extra gigs

193
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:35,870
on here<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we don't know about so when</font>

194
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:37,550
we write a file for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example our balance</font>

195
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:39,500
sheet I'm an accountant I've got a

00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,750
balance<font color="#CCCCCC"> sheet how many times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a day any</font>

197
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,810
accountants here know how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

198
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:47,629
baby you updated a balance sheet guess

199
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,160
it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your company right you're</font>

200
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing walmart you get a hundred thousand</font>

201
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,930
sales of age you might be updating that

202
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:56,839
balance sheet 100,000 times<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay when</font>

203
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:59,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">you write it to too many times we're</font>

204
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,920
going to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> some wear leveling and we're</font>

205
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,719
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of one cell and put</font>

206
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,040
it in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different cell and we're going</font>

207
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,050
to update<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple more times and this</font>

208
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,490
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen and then we cut we go</font>

209
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,769
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cell that we are in</font>

210
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,629
and then we realize oh that sells been

211
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:13,459
updated<font color="#E5E5E5"> too many times now we're going</font>

212
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:16,279
to mark that as bad because we don't

213
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:20,300
want that cell to go bad and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

214
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:22,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put the balance sheet now is going to</font>

215
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,729
be up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have a mouse anymore</font>

216
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,439
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put that balance sheet up</font>

217
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,569
here in the top which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where our</font>

218
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:30,740
over-provisioning is so we didn't put it

219
00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:34,550
anywhere else<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we're in the</font>

220
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:38,180
over-provisioning state where we're

221
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:40,099
going to add that balance sheet okay so

222
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,378
the biggest thing that impacts how much

223
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,709
space you have available on your SSD is

224
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:48,829
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> dynamic your data is so if you're</font>

225
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:52,069
changing files all the time then maybe

226
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:57,258
you don't want to use an SSD yes it's

227
00:10:52,069 --> 00:11:00,110
fast and yes they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> reliable now but</font>

228
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:02,360
you could wear<font color="#CCCCCC"> out real quick so I hear</font>

229
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,759
of a lot of companies using SSDs in

230
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,680
their servers and I I say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

231
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:08,329
a smart idea because it's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

232
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,579
really fast to read and write<font color="#E5E5E5"> data but</font>

233
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:13,130
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be wearing out your SSDs</font>

234
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:14,089
real quick depending on how dynamic your

235
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,800
data is

236
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:19,879
and they haven't understood that part

237
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:22,128
yet however not all is lost right the

238
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,769
SSD controller gets shirt make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

239
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:26,269
all pages get programmed any race about

240
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:28,009
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of times so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

241
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:30,079
we're leveling and stuff like that and

242
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:32,029
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a larger pool of spare</font>

243
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,430
over provision space now that space is

244
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:37,430
only accessible by the SSD itself by the

245
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:38,959
firmware so we have our spinning<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk we</font>

246
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,609
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything where things go and</font>

247
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,459
stuff like that and we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

248
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:46,670
access to just about all of it except

249
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:48,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the you know sometimes the notebook</font>

250
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:50,540
manufacturer the hardware manufacturer

251
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:52,069
will say I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put this aside here</font>

252
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,800
so in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to recover something</font>

253
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:56,540
I've got a recovery partition and stuff

254
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,059
like that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically can get to every</font>

255
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:01,998
<font color="#E5E5E5">single part on a spinning this when we</font>

256
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:05,509
go to an SSD we have some visible

257
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:09,949
invisible areas that BOS that the

258
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:11,269
operating system can't see and it's

259
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:14,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">really interesting because you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I've</font>

260
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:16,339
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> 64 gigs here but I've got maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

261
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:19,309
to 12 gigs that I cannot see with my

262
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:21,259
operating<font color="#CCCCCC"> system and that's the</font>

263
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:23,779
over-provisioning part in case these

264
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:27,470
cells over here go bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I need</font>

265
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:29,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">someplace else to remap them okay now</font>

266
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:32,329
SSDs are gaining in popularity of course

267
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,519
and the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get popular when</font>

268
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:37,069
you're a hard drive manufacturer or an

269
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:39,170
SSD manufacturer is make the SSD look

270
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:42,920
like a hard distract so if you look at

271
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:44,839
an SSD with I don't know a hex editor

272
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,610
running on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows it's going to look</font>

273
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:47,870
basically like a hard drive you're not

274
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:50,449
going to see much difference right and

275
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:52,819
they do this by following you know these

276
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:54,800
88 commands and stuff like that they

277
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:56,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually have to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's called see</font>

278
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,758
if i can get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> up here this flash</font>

279
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,189
translation layer so the flash

280
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:03,829
translation layer tells the operating

281
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:05,629
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you've got these 88 commands</font>

282
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:08,569
which has been going on for you know

283
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:10,910
like a decade<font color="#E5E5E5"> and treat it just like</font>

284
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:12,319
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're going to take the 88</font>

285
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:16,040
command and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write things</font>

286
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:19,399
to our SSD just like you were writing

287
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,809
them to the hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> describe so when we</font>

288
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,929
write something too hard this track yes

289
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:22,929
sir

290
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:31,149
it's yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's SSD firmware which which</font>

291
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:34,540
which raises another question right

292
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:38,920
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single manufacturer has their own</font>

293
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:40,899
class translation i right yeah its

294
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,120
firmware in thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> great so when we</font>

295
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:45,639
tell it right to something on a hard

296
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,069
disk drive we say go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this page and</font>

297
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:50,050
write stuff when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have our flash</font>

298
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:52,209
translation layer we say go to this page

299
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:54,189
and write stuff but if thats been

300
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:55,540
written too many times then we're going

301
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:57,550
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to someplace else we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

302
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">put it there however we're still telling</font>

303
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,719
the operating system we know where it's

304
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,660
at and here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it's at so</font>

305
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately what happens is that can</font>

306
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:12,670
leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> from stale data all over the SSD</font>

307
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:15,519
we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some other issues what if</font>

308
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,979
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to wipe the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SSD military</font>

309
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:22,569
specifications how many times<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

310
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:25,600
overwrite<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mil-spec up to 35 right</font>

311
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:28,449
depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the confidentiality level</font>

312
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,360
of the data right one project<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was on I</font>

313
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:33,729
did a stint with<font color="#CCCCCC"> scic and one project I</font>

314
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,250
was on we had to not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only do all these</font>

315
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:39,189
overwrites but then we had to sandblast

316
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,720
the disk and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we had to melt them</font>

317
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:41,889
down so I don't know why we're good just

318
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,329
couldn't melt<font color="#E5E5E5"> them down to begin with</font>

319
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:48,639
but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the military right</font>

320
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:50,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay unfortunately we can't access all</font>

321
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,829
the pages with an operating system on

322
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,540
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we have over provision data</font>

323
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:58,149
that will still contain data over

324
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">prevent in the over provision space also</font>

325
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:05,860
anybody remember anybody dealt with

326
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:08,439
fries lock yeah you like it of course

327
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">not it's inconvenient but you know what</font>

328
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:12,969
we trade convenience for security right

329
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:15,399
so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called freeze lock</font>

330
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:19,389
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically so we don't</font>

331
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:23,680
mistakenly wipe our SSD or our hard

332
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:25,209
drive itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay some other issues SSP</font>

333
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,459
is a fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> new that's why they got this</font>

334
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:28,750
flash translation layer in so people

335
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:31,000
will accept it because hard drive

336
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,500
manufacturer I'm sorry computer

337
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,559
manufacturers don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to come up with</font>

338
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,990
their a new way to access the SSP

339
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,380
because we can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the ATA commands</font>

340
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font>

341
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:43,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been using for over a decade ata</font>

342
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,300
security race that's in the in the

343
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:51,400
firmware and stuff like that it doesn't

344
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:55,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">work very well with FF DS and way a guy</font>

345
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:59,590
down at UC San Diego and his team tried

346
00:15:55,270 --> 00:16:02,170
11 SSDs that say they supported<font color="#CCCCCC"> the HEA</font>

347
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:04,300
security race command and only eight<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

348
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,949
them supported it and three of those had

349
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,500
a bug<font color="#CCCCCC"> the implementation where it wasn't</font>

350
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:09,940
reliable so out of 11 we really only had

351
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:15,730
five that they said you could actually

352
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:19,390
rely on for security racing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you can</font>

353
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:21,370
do a cryptographic key razor it works on

354
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,660
hard drives or SSD or whatever and you

355
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,160
just delete the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> you encrypt the</font>

356
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,650
entire disk and then you delete the key

357
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bruce Schneier says that's great if</font>

358
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,640
you're implementing it perfectly and

359
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:34,360
it's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> perfectly every single</font>

360
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:36,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">time and the other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is yeah we</font>

361
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,380
could do that but what happens in three

362
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:41,350
or four years when somebody breaks that

363
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,600
cryptographic key and then they can get

364
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:46,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">in at your data and you know for us we</font>

365
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,440
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care I who have data from</font>

366
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">three or four years ago that they still</font>

367
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,950
use one that wasn't hypothetical

368
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:57,280
question you know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a real quick</font>

369
00:16:53,950 --> 00:17:02,770
yeah one two three or four<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

370
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:04,389
many others though right and if you

371
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:06,699
don't do the cryptography wrong or

372
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:10,000
correctly you know you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

373
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:14,470
problems now how would that<font color="#CCCCCC"> be would</font>

374
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:19,510
that be easy to break just stand it

375
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:22,480
upside down right okay so when we're

376
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:24,699
doing erasure on SSDs we got to deal

377
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,680
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this FTL and the fries lock and</font>

378
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:28,449
stuff like that we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the</font>

379
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,790
OEMs got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> cooperate they have to</font>

380
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:32,980
actually perfectly implement their

381
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:39,639
security race or their version of

382
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:42,700
security race on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> H a command the</font>

383
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,140
security racer has to be verifiable can

384
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,170
we verify improve that it actually

385
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:49,630
happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how are you going to verify</font>

386
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:51,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> operating system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how many</font>

387
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,220
of you use a

388
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,010
a hex editor or something like that to

389
00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:02,080
view data on a hard drive without having

390
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:04,750
an operating<font color="#CCCCCC"> system yeah how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would you</font>

391
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:09,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">do that how are you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to verify that</font>

392
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:11,110
there is no data left on here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

393
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:13,300
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trust the OEM the people making</font>

394
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:17,439
these SSDs and implementing that

395
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:18,520
firmware and once they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been once</font>

396
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,920
they've said they've done it you know

397
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,180
they have to report it well how do you

398
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,550
report it if you don't know if it

399
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:26,440
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened so here again we have</font>

400
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:31,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">to rely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on their implementation of a</font>

flash translation layer what doesn't

402
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,380
work here's some things that myself and

403
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,930
some other researchers have tried

404
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,700
logically racing formatting this cheery

405
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:44,200
race we know that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work Chris</font>

406
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:46,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">perfect eraser we delete the key which</font>

407
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,010
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sanitizes the data but you still</font>

408
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,200
got data on the hard drive and maybe in

409
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:52,780
the future somebody you know will find

410
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,090
that SSD and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll be able to decrypt</font>

411
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:57,070
it because you know we're humans and

412
00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:00,159
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> we make is imperfect by</font>

413
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,600
nature<font color="#CCCCCC"> so perhaps one of these days</font>

414
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,970
somebody will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to break the</font>

415
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,919
encryption and then we have traditional

416
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:07,900
overriding but when we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

417
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,030
going to overwrite<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff however some of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the stuff that we're overriding the SSD</font>

419
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:14,770
is going to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe that should be</font>

420
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:17,260
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and then we have stuff stale</font>

00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:20,830
data left over on the parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the SSD</font>

422
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:23,410
that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have access to because the</font>

423
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:26,290
operating system now what might work if

424
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:27,370
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use reuse the SSD there are</font>

425
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:31,600
some people out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there that have</font>

426
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:33,370
solutions<font color="#CCCCCC"> Blanco ease as part of</font>

427
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,709
managing stuff like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font>

428
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:37,570
use them how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you verify it actually</font>

429
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:40,660
happen like Blanco they'll give you a

430
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:42,189
report yes we sanitize this SSD well

431
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,610
heck that's good enough for me I can

432
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:48,220
throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that away now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right they said that</font>

433
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:51,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">their solution works Who am I not to</font>

434
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:54,700
trust them after all I paid 129 bucks

435
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:58,510
for that for that software right so they

436
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:00,160
wouldn't lie to me would they well maybe

437
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:02,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to grandma grandma would believe him</font>

438
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,929
right but you know we're a little bit

439
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:07,889
smarter<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that</font>

440
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:10,649
here again we got manufacturers

441
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:14,070
utilities<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ars Technica</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also did a study</font>

442
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:15,689
and they had 12 drives only for erase

443
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,580
their data reliably and one of those

444
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">claimed that they were doing it but all</font>

445
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:25,199
they did was you know just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

446
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:27,690
formatting so we got three from him<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

447
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,119
you could overwrite multiple times and

448
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:34,529
use the security race and use a firmware

449
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:37,049
initialization that should be about that

450
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:39,690
hasn't worked reliably in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> classes</font>

451
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:41,940
way found out and also the freeze lock

452
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,409
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> overcome freeze lock and all</font>

453
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,179
you got to do for freeze lock is you got

454
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:47,369
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to sleep for a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

455
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:49,200
wake it back up the non-volatile systems

456
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:52,470
laboratory said that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> bypassed the</font>

457
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,629
FTL and got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nan but they had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

458
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,309
develop new flash translation<font color="#CCCCCC"> laterz</font>

459
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:57,539
they developed new extensions to it and

460
00:20:56,309 --> 00:21:00,210
stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they could directly</font>

461
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:03,119
access the SSD so they could make sure

462
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:04,679
that they sanitized it now here's

463
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:09,299
another one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not a smart man</font>

464
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:11,549
guy I took this little SSD here somebody

465
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:13,168
gave this to me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hey can</font>

466
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:15,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">you check this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that everything is</font>

467
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:16,950
completely erased off of it and I

468
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:19,259
checked it of course and<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess what</font>

469
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:22,919
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was data all over the place</font>

470
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:25,379
unfortunately I was checking it with a

471
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:27,690
hospital program that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> running on top</font>

472
00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:29,730
of an operating system and guess what

473
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:32,399
the operating system can't see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

474
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:34,019
provision part of the SSD so how was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

475
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:37,498
supposed to verify that this was totally

476
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:44,340
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and be thrown away I</font>

477
00:21:37,499 --> 00:21:47,070
couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> I couldn't find a way and then</font>

478
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,559
my wife said well don't you have

479
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:51,600
forensic tools at your disposal so I

480
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:54,960
said hey I do I wonder if<font color="#CCCCCC"> this will work</font>

481
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:58,649
so I did a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> copy from a hard disk</font>

482
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,350
drive to this SSD using a tableau

483
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:04,580
forensic duplicator guess what happened

484
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:11,809
bit copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit stream copy</font>

485
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:13,279
the FTL did get in the way right just

486
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:18,289
going to tell me do this do this do this

487
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:22,070
to this right so did it work not quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

488
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:24,260
couldn't access it with the operating

489
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:27,559
system anymore so i tried parted magic

490
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:30,500
and here's what came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and parted magic</font>

491
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:32,418
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have 64 gigs and when i open it up</font>

492
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,809
in parted magic you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got this our</font>

493
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:39,590
ID or<font color="#E5E5E5"> our I data right so what is this</font>

494
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:43,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">so one two three what is that 8.7 gigs</font>

495
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:45,500
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 point yeah eight point seven</font>

496
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:47,210
gigabytes is what its reporting well if

497
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">I did the bitstream copy of this</font>

498
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:58,399
shouldn't there be nothing on there

499
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:59,539
that's bike that's how much space is on

500
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:02,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">this hard drive I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at the</font>

501
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:05,899
bottom one it's bri data one so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got</font>

502
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:08,240
88.7 gigs that parted magic is saying is

503
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:11,090
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> here but wait a minute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i did a</font>

504
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,789
bit stream copy from 64 gig to 64 gigs

505
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:16,340
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i should have 64 gigs of space</font>

506
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:17,840
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me write minus a little bit</font>

507
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,389
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could I could figure a couple</font>

508
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,370
of Meg's for over-provisioning because

509
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:25,399
we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use it and they got the sales</font>

510
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:27,080
got written too many time so then I

511
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:30,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought okay we got that much space</font>

512
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,779
there and then I selected it because in

513
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:35,360
parted magic you select which<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk you</font>

514
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:38,809
want to run this on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did a wipe and</font>

515
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:44,750
when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did that it reported a different</font>

516
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:47,928
number and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was thinking what huh what</font>

517
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:49,549
well I'm doing this in hearted magic

518
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:51,830
that I was also doing it on a linux

519
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:54,889
distribution so here again I've got an

520
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:58,250
operating system going up against this

521
00:23:54,889 --> 00:24:00,289
SSD and the flash translation layer not

522
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:02,870
telling me you know everything that's

523
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:06,889
going on so of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is unreliable</font>

524
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:08,719
I set it to wipe anyway and lo and

525
00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:10,580
behold I did it on three thirty in the

526
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,909
afternoon and I realized well you know

527
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:17,389
on this isn't making very good progress

528
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:22,009
here so I came back<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next day</font>

529
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:23,718
it was Oh golly 19 hours I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

530
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:26,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like that when it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> finally</font>

531
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:29,359
finished and when it finally finished it

532
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:30,678
said hey success we're done so then of

533
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,199
course I connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to my window</font>

534
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:35,959
system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jessie buddy hey you know</font>

535
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I need to format this drive so I</font>

536
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:40,039
connected it up to my window system and

537
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:43,129
I said okay I'll format this drive ntfs

538
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:45,169
no problem 64 gigs or maybe eight gigs

539
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:46,609
or maybe four gigs whatever the size is

540
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:48,739
it shouldn't go shouldn't take too long

541
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:50,299
and I even<font color="#E5E5E5"> did the little you know I</font>

542
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:53,690
uncheck the box so it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a</font>

543
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:56,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">quick format and it failed on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quick</font>

544
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:59,119
format but it took about three hours to

545
00:24:56,419 --> 00:25:02,989
fail<font color="#CCCCCC"> so then I thought well what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I do</font>

546
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:08,329
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> full format so I check the box to make</font>

547
00:25:02,989 --> 00:25:12,529
sure it doesn't do a quick format and 37

548
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:14,658
hours later it failed yeah so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

549
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:16,729
like oh ok good thing at spring break

550
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:19,969
and I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go teach raising so</font>

551
00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:22,940
now i have an expensive paperweight

552
00:25:19,969 --> 00:25:25,669
because not only can my OS not see it

553
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:29,179
parted magic couldn't do anything with

554
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:31,849
it I tried that OS can't see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font>

555
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:37,070
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now is the data</font>

556
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:38,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">gone according to researchers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

557
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:41,629
according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what I would think I would</font>

558
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:44,570
think I still have data on here I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

559
00:25:41,629 --> 00:25:47,779
trusting anything way<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and those guys</font>

560
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:49,279
they wrote data to an SSD<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they put</font>

561
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:52,039
fingerprints on it so they knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font>

562
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,659
what data they personally wrote and so

563
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:56,509
they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> find it again and they did</font>

564
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:58,579
overriding<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 about 20 times up to 20</font>

565
00:25:56,509 --> 00:26:00,109
time it's been reliable and they said

566
00:25:58,579 --> 00:26:01,339
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the built-in sanitized commands</font>

567
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:03,889
are effective when implemented correctly

568
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:06,259
but they're usually not and so they

569
00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:09,439
ended up making three of their own flash

570
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:15,589
translation extensions to sanitize<font color="#E5E5E5"> files</font>

571
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:18,649
and disk SSD now when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really got to</font>

572
00:26:15,589 --> 00:26:20,208
get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the data what do you do well</font>

573
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:22,758
you could do physical destruction right

574
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:24,589
take this off and take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard take the</font>

575
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:26,450
motherboard out and all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

576
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:29,208
stuff but you can still get data off of

577
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:31,190
the chips we had a chip off thing

578
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:32,750
yesterday right so or was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that today</font>

579
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:35,330
I was this morning right you can still

580
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:37,340
get that was yesterday right you can

581
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:39,590
still get data off the chimp I've got a

582
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:41,540
colleague at George Mason University he

583
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,760
and I are working on chip off

584
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:47,240
information from point-of-sale devices

585
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,160
so you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> telephone size</font>

586
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,450
things are in the in the restaurant you

587
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,160
swipe your card if they don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

588
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,960
response when they put in the phone

589
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,880
number they don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a response in five</font>

590
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,280
minutes they spit out a receipt anyway

591
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:02,030
and then may batch process all of the

592
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:03,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">leftover transactions that night and if</font>

593
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,970
somebody comes and swipes that before

594
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,230
the batch processing gets done then they

595
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,000
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a whole bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

596
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:11,840
on their hands well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't get any</font>

597
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the information out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the chip that</font>

598
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,340
when they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected to this device</font>

599
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,640
so he has a team now that's doing a chip

600
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,899
off retrieval of the data and he said

601
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,410
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very fun but it's still</font>

602
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:25,910
possible if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do want to disintegrate</font>

603
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:28,520
or pulverizer melt it down or whatever

604
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:31,190
be sure you check the laws in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your local</font>

605
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,230
area for electronic dispose of waste or

606
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,490
electronic waste disposal because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

607
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:37,850
are some parts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the country where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

608
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:40,730
can't throw that out in the garbage just

609
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:46,070
something fun I went on a business trip

610
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:49,190
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> China and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

611
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:52,580
electronic waste disposal stuff and they

612
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:54,770
brought us to their<font color="#CCCCCC"> factory and so are</font>

613
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:56,870
there any heavy metals in motherboards

614
00:27:54,770 --> 00:28:02,780
and chips<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff like that yeah like</font>

615
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:04,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">what mercury anything else lead yeah</font>

616
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,200
there's some gold and silver<font color="#CCCCCC"> and copper</font>

617
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:08,990
and tin and you know stuff like that

618
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:12,590
well they brought us into this<font color="#E5E5E5"> factory</font>

619
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:14,450
and they had workers on a table and they

620
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:17,480
had little chisels and pointy hammers

621
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:18,770
and stuff and they're going breaking

622
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,450
these things off they had some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

623
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:21,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that were melting some solder off of it</font>

624
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:23,420
and stuff like that and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said what are</font>

625
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">they doing oh well they're dismantling</font>

626
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,840
at men we're going to melt the metal

627
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">down and you know separate them out and</font>

628
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,370
stuff like that and I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> what about</font>

629
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:35,330
the mercury oh we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not worried about</font>

630
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:36,860
the mercury thank you I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

631
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:39,770
any closer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm worried about the</font>

632
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:41,120
mercury evidently when you have more

633
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:43,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">than a billion people in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> country</font>

634
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,139
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you lose a couple of mercury</font>

635
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:51,919
poisoning you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really don't care right</font>

636
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:52,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so basically for ssds here's some</font>

637
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,650
more information<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you want to read</font>

638
00:28:52,970 --> 00:29:00,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">more and this is a very shortness of</font>

639
00:28:54,650 --> 00:29:02,930
places some if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to delete</font>

640
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:07,070
securely delete data on the SF vs right

641
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:10,250
now i would say pulverize or melt or

642
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:14,030
something but<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever you do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

643
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:21,560
you got to get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those chips yes</font>

644
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:24,320
sir pardon me um Blanco says that

645
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:29,300
they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really good solution ela</font>

646
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:34,970
VLAN CCO however we are relying on their

647
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:37,820
own reporting so self reporting I mean I

648
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:39,800
have not seen them given to<font color="#E5E5E5"> NIST you</font>

649
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,389
know this has some stuff right<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but</font>

650
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:50,180
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't seen them tested by Miss yet</font>

651
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:52,610
oh yeah the UC San Diego guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

652
00:29:50,180 --> 00:30:02,210
FTL's those haven't been made publicly

653
00:29:52,610 --> 00:30:05,629
available yet yes sir yes anything with

654
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:07,970
an SSD as part of it now you don't need

655
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:18,950
to pulverize the spinning disk part of

656
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:22,070
it yeah yes is the chip yes sir to

657
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:25,910
destroy for ssds<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 for any hard drives</font>

658
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:27,950
oh really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wow I have I haven't worked</font>

659
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:35,300
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government for that part of the</font>

660
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:41,390
government for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while right double</font>

661
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:44,120
check to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what it is and right of</font>

662
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:48,200
SSDs<font color="#E5E5E5"> em yeah and this put out a new one</font>

663
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:49,969
in 2014 new<font color="#E5E5E5"> data disposal thing so and</font>

664
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,350
there's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> says you know depending</font>

665
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,640
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> confidentiality</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of in levels</font>

666
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,709
here's what you need to do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

667
00:30:52,640 --> 00:31:19,230
like that yes ma'am

668
00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:20,700
sure exactly yet you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust the</font>

669
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,710
manufacture when he says oh yeah this

670
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,360
this cot sanitized we're good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

671
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,529
because they're doing their own

672
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:30,658
reporting there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party</font>

673
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:31,950
objective checks and balances on this I

674
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:34,740
guess you know there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing nobody</font>

675
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:36,120
verifying that and you know I wish

676
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">Consumer Reports would come out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and say</font>

677
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,949
oh yeah this one works but do we trust

678
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:42,840
Consumer Reports anymore some people say

679
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:44,700
yes some people say no I mean they're

680
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:50,010
paying the vendors pay for them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

681
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:52,140
the report so well<font color="#CCCCCC"> if there's no other</font>

682
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:53,850
questions and I know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only one</font>
