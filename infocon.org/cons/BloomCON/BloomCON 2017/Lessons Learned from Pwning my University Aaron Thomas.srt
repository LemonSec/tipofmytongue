remembering all those numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

me finding a really silly shell

injection vulnerability that really

15
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:50,339
should never exist<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how a silly idea</font>

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:52,500
had with QR codes made me start<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,239
how crazy idea involving some QR codes

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,699
turn me into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of a security</font>

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,969
some disagreement some of you might not

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,099
know it's for more<font color="#CCCCCC"> crafts originally not</font>

rolling or they were trolled and it in

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,159
this context we're going to call it just

26
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,570
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something despite the fact that</font>

27
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,259
there are security controls in place

28
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,449
stop you from doing that so let's talk

29
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,450
about incident it's basically a

30
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,549
combination of<font color="#CCCCCC"> two things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can cause</font>

33
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,770
my friend Jake said hey check this out

34
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:34,289
and he said check to that out all right

here's the mouse and I can like click

46
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,310
this is how the university<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants users</font>

47
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,220
to get their files when they're not here

48
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,680
but I didn't get much i found this

49
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,870
button or choose permission so first<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

50
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,310
have to select<font color="#E5E5E5"> the directory it doesn't</font>

51
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:38,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">really matter which for these purposes</font>

52
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:44,620
and from here Oh hit the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong button</font>

53
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:48,010
cuz it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> off-screen we hit permissions</font>

54
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:50,590
perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> and brings up this little wizard</font>

55
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,298
where you can go next and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

56
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,370
give read permissions give<font color="#CCCCCC"> read/write</font>

57
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:55,989
give full control and none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those were</font>

58
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,220
very interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me because I</font>

59
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:59,890
couldn't do that because I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

60
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,209
the Russians but I could view them and

61
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,399
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because I could</font>

62
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:06,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">see different users that could do stuff</font>

63
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,019
screech furan groups and that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

64
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,600
really leads<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the group's page where</font>

65
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:12,130
there's all the weird groups where these

66
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,980
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups I've traded and it creates an</font>

67
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:17,650
admin and owner group as well and then

68
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,950
this special link you can create a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

69
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:24,940
group this pages were all the magic of

70
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:28,929
incidents whatever happened can wait for

71
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:31,359
it to load so we can create a group type

72
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,220
of personal and normally it doesn't

73
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:35,799
allow us to have lower case text

74
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:40,239
numerals periods dashes underscores if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

75
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:42,640
do group I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just do errands</font>

76
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,200
group with a poss vs space group for

77
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">demonstration because that's clearly not</font>

78
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,269
valid

79
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,269
[Music]

80
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,320
so it'll say hey you can't have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

81
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:03,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">name so i click create group it'll just</font>

82
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,750
say this<font color="#CCCCCC"> but using a magical tool that</font>

83
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:10,610
only wheat hackers know about called

84
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:14,090
inspect element<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sorry it's true in</font>

85
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:16,850
this folder yeah this field right here

86
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:20,000
there's this class required validate I

87
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:22,250
do that and it'll send a post request

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,130
and actually try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it and a long</font>

89
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:28,250
time ago it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't have said umg name</font>

90
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:29,570
is not acceptable it was said something

91
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:38,990
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're going to see what it</font>

92
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:42,170
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to my slide so yeah</font>

93
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,480
this now it validated my input that was

94
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:46,430
not always the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> because incident</font>

95
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,700
whatever has been reported and fixed

96
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:52,400
that input and I gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> it errands group</font>

97
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,099
it would tell me this make group<font color="#E5E5E5"> SH</font>

98
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,450
error you gave this file<font color="#CCCCCC"> to garments or</font>

99
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,390
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should run this with two arguments</font>

100
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:02,900
you gave three I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was pretty</font>

101
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:05,840
weird so what's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just gave it</font>

102
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,940
the seemingly not that bad group<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron's</font>

103
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,219
group and there was a shell script I

104
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,480
wanted to everyone so got three that

105
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,440
means user input is being passed

106
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:17,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">directly to the shell so we're gonna own</font>

107
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,219
the shell we're gonna pone the shell so

108
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,250
one of the two things is happening it's

109
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">neither doing SH make group SH input</font>

110
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:27,440
from the form and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then something or it's</font>

111
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,030
doing something and then input so we

112
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,070
need to do is we need to satisfy group

113
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:34,219
sh and then handle to something at the

114
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:37,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">end if that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the case so let's just</font>

115
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:40,220
give it the employee<font color="#CCCCCC"> X semicolon LS if</font>

116
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,740
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something at the beginning it'll</font>

117
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,570
she'll just make a group for X or

118
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:48,920
whatever and then show us the current

119
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:51,050
directory you should work it didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

120
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,240
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means it's the other way around</font>

121
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it said it you only gave one</font>

122
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,220
argument so I know oh hey I'm supposed

123
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,080
to give it two arguments the beginning

124
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,690
separated by spaces of semicolon and

125
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,810
then my commands and then I can just

126
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:09,810
comment out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing so i did is</font>

127
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,730
I could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> SH make group all right the</font>

128
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,610
way it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> is SH make group that Sh</font>

129
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:16,290
the input<font color="#CCCCCC"> i give and then something at</font>

130
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">this point we know we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

131
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">satisfy make group and we're going to</font>

132
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">handle or something so we're just going</font>

133
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,800
to echo whatever is at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

134
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> curious</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to know what</font>

135
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:30,000
it is I'm poking around and having<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font>

136
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:31,710
so X<font color="#E5E5E5"> SpaceX LS echo the files in the</font>

137
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,960
working directory and then it was like

138
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:37,380
Penn State username so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out the</font>

139
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,000
way make group<font color="#CCCCCC"> SH worked is it just said</font>

140
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,070
it the first part is the input that's

141
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,900
the name of the group the second part is

142
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,460
who the group is going to be created for

143
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:49,500
and who's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in the group and</font>

144
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:51,510
then it was done but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the files I saw</font>

145
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,520
that I thought were cool were make group

146
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:55,590
that Sh because that's the one that was

147
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing stuff and I was interacting with a</font>

148
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,299
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one called bad</font>

149
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:04,500
words<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> txt and at this point I'm</font>

150
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:07,530
excited because I'm in I made<font color="#E5E5E5"> it by the</font>

151
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,750
way the file extension is Carl di e JY

152
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:13,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">Fe that's how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you pronounce it spelled</font>

153
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:16,830
gif I'll life it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gift for Jeff and</font>

154
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:19,260
so some lessons learned at this point is

155
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">that these silly vulnerabilities are out</font>

156
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,289
there and if you're a web admin you

157
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,809
might want to make sure they're not

158
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:26,070
there and if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find them</font>

159
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,260
you're gonna have to look where most

160
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,180
people never will I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe to</font>

161
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,789
say less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 10 people had actually</font>

162
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,950
used that create group page in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past</font>

163
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:38,940
few years I might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been the only</font>

164
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:40,409
person to view it so future injections

165
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,969
we know what that's something at the end

166
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,889
is and it doesn't really matter we just

167
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:48,150
want it gone so we can just comment it

168
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:51,030
out with a pound sign so i wanna i want

169
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,919
to see within bad words txt just for

170
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,169
curiosity sake and there's some weird

171
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:57,419
stuff in there that wasn't that<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad that</font>

172
00:07:55,169 --> 00:08:00,330
i'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> show off so there was carpet</font>

173
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:03,270
muncher if you want to insult most

174
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:06,120
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess at least fifty percent of</font>

175
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:11,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">people probably molester priests which</font>

176
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:14,700
is I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I can see how that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

177
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:17,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">be offensive but it's so badly done that</font>

178
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,169
it's more funny than offensive and this

179
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,628
one I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really enjoyed was just route</font>

180
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:24,120
zeroes instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> o's and apparently</font>

181
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:26,879
that's bad but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually can create</font>

182
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,259
groups with those in them that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

183
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you can't name the entire group</font>

184
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:33,329
itself it was really funky so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

185
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:36,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">just look at the contents of make group</font>

186
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:38,098
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do X SpaceX cat make</font>

187
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,620
group and then comment out everything at

188
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:42,870
the end and so this gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> me the entire</font>

189
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,790
script on a single line there were<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

190
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,820
line breaks there's no semicolons

191
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:50,819
between the individual line but it did

192
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,050
say in one of the lines echo you should

193
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,839
have run this file with two arguments

194
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:57,240
you gave it this many and I just want to

195
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:01,440
say to ever made that script thank you I

196
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:04,709
had nice animated yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font>

197
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,350
appeared right cool so lessons learned

198
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:09,300
helpful error messages can hurt a lot it

199
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,410
was well if they're too helpful and

200
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,500
they're displayed to the wrong people

201
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:16,019
and so you want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful and come</font>

202
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,850
earlier but that<font color="#CCCCCC"> applies to everyone in</font>

203
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:20,610
this context as well because at this

204
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,800
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was on my laptop connected to</font>

205
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">university Wi-Fi log isn't lot of the</font>

206
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,089
image myself logged into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web app as</font>

207
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,529
myself so I thought you know what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

208
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:30,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't report this and they find it</font>

209
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:32,730
someday and realize I saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a bad</font>

210
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,269
word file I might actually get in

211
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,860
trouble so let's report this bad boy so

212
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:39,630
I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the IT help desk in the library</font>

213
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,870
because that's the first place I can

214
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:45,959
think of they say hey talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the head</font>

215
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:48,660
of IT<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just left like all right I'll</font>

216
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:51,060
come back tomorrow now the next day I

217
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:54,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">come in I try to thoroughly explained</font>

218
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:56,849
the issue to him like I go hard on all

219
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,860
out explaining look it's executing the

220
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:01,620
command I know what the server is doing

221
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,589
he<font color="#CCCCCC"> just tells me oh yeah it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

222
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,600
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Linux server that's not</font>

223
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:08,880
why because of the bad news we made web

224
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,819
app he says hey just send an email to

225
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,550
the help desk so I'm kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dejected at</font>

226
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:16,649
this point but I'm like okay so I send

227
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,469
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> the email put the nice subject</font>

228
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:21,240
header vulnerability of report so it

229
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,699
sends a really good email extreme

230
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,110
documentation on it I got a awesome

231
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:27,390
description and some examples of

232
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,190
exploits they're just showing like find

233
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,500
out who is logged into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shell what</font>

234
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,830
groups there in where the shell is and

235
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,050
then

236
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:36,480
last one was that little fork bomb that

237
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,130
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are familiar with I put</font>

238
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,260
over that one don't do this it's a fork

239
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:43,500
bomb and the server didn't crash so I

240
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">think they followed my advice and so the</font>

241
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,490
ticket got escalated pretty quickly

242
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:50,460
because it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really help desk</font>

243
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:53,040
material I made it<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 952</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I am when i</font>

244
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,800
sent the email got<font color="#E5E5E5"> escalated from help</font>

245
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,560
desk to general IT about an hour later

246
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then it got escalated to the out</font>

247
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,609
steam five minutes later and someone

248
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:07,320
without numbers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their penn state ID</font>

249
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:09,390
commented on at like 30 for and the

250
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,550
reason no numbers is probably important

251
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:14,460
is because students typically have like

252
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:16,530
four numbers after<font color="#E5E5E5"> their name so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AZT 70</font>

253
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,000
with me<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm a rare</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exception where i</font>

254
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,220
only have two numbers for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

255
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,080
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was thanks for the</font>

256
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:25,380
report we have programmers responsible

257
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,330
site looking at it now and 526 there's

258
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,580
other comment thank you again for your

259
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,980
report programs informed me they fixed

260
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,840
it blah blah blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

261
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,480
said at the end let me know if you have

262
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,760
any further<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions and i have a</font>

263
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,500
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> i asked do they have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bug</font>

264
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,840
bounty probe do they have a bug bounty

265
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,790
program he said no and they actually

266
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,320
discourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thankful for</font>

267
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">your report you helped make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a better</font>

268
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,920
place which I sort of interpreted like

269
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:55,530
this they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> told me get out so we've</font>

270
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,449
learned a few more lessons so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hence</font>

271
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:59,730
state does not have a bug bounty program

272
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:02,250
they do not encourage bug hunting and

273
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,930
don't get caught also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suppose if you</font>

274
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:08,040
don't have a bug bounty program try to

275
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:10,770
be nicer when you say go<font color="#CCCCCC"> away but still</font>

276
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,110
get the point across<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that finishes up</font>

277
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,670
the wonderful story of what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned</font>

278
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">from incident whatever we're going to</font>

279
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:19,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">move on to QR codes so raise your hand</font>

280
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:22,439
if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your smartphone with you</font>

281
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:24,360
raise your hand or get your smartphone

00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">out now are you the smartphone ready</font>

283
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:31,770
open your barcode scanning app so scan

284
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:33,930
this QR code the QR codes are cool you

285
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,699
can scan this one and it has a nice

286
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:38,250
message for anyone who can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

287
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,680
it's just to demonstrate QR codes are

288
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,750
just a two-dimensional barcode that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

289
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,010
can encode anything in you can encode

290
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,840
just the text

291
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:48,000
you did it which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this one</font>

292
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,580
contains you could have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> URL which is</font>

293
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,160
what is most<font color="#E5E5E5"> commonplace it could also</font>

294
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:55,050
just actually encode an entire image in

295
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,990
a QR code so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a real</font>

296
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:00,359
meanie face you can actually encode a

297
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,430
whole QR code inside of another QR code

298
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,680
and then they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to get their</font>

299
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:07,500
friend to scan that one don't do it and

300
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,800
so bulletin board flyers raise your hand

301
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,750
if you would trust a QR code on random

302
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,400
bulletin board around campus you scan it

303
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:20,220
and you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what that's okay</font>

304
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:22,230
anyone anyone nobody raised their hands

305
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:25,560
we ever real smart people that's right

306
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:28,440
they're not very trustworthy now this is

307
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:31,439
scary to you I think the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is now</font>

308
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,540
yes because what if someone's a ninja

309
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,270
they could steal a flyer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> replace it</font>

310
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,670
they could put up a modified flyer it's

311
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:41,100
not really difficult task go up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

312
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:43,770
bulletin board snatch<font color="#E5E5E5"> a poster when no</font>

313
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,150
one's looking take it home put a

314
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,699
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing on it put it back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

315
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:50,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">when no one's looking found a difficult</font>

316
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,590
task there's a few implications for that

317
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,990
where if there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fire with a QR code</font>

318
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:57,600
that has a link to something you can

319
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:59,460
choose what URL people visit so you can

320
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,040
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> some fun things like rick roll them</font>

321
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,020
you can spread propaganda or you can do

322
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,959
some nasty shenanigans with URL

323
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,970
redirection so we have to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> afraid</font>

324
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they could execute JavaScript</font>

325
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:14,280
and then redirect the browser such as

326
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,780
this nice example do bad things window

327
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,959
dot location equals example.com

328
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:20,730
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not actually doing bad</font>

329
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,930
things there's bad things you can do

330
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,640
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript but that's really</font>

331
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,709
outside the scope of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk of my</font>

332
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:29,189
expertise because I'm not a fan of

333
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:31,590
javascript is it hard to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it's</font>

334
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:33,930
not you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> scan it you can save it as</font>

335
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:36,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">an image you generate a new QR code you</font>

336
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:40,140
can edit it using GIMP this is really a

337
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:41,939
trivial task and but that's a lot of

338
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,189
tedious work so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to do this</font>

339
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want to automate it so I'm going to</font>

340
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,750
automate it in Python so I need to

341
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:50,850
generate QR codes there's a module

342
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:53,830
called QR code and for image processing

343
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:57,070
I said hey I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use pillow</font>

344
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:59,980
so begins the dream of QR replacer or

345
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:02,800
generated QR code I place it over QR

346
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,660
codes in an existing image and I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

347
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,400
hackathon and tell people and I get two

348
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,839
people to help me I've can three

349
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,670
undergraduate students with no

350
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:14,740
experience and image processing<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it in</font>

351
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:17,349
under 36 hours the answer is almost we

352
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,690
made<font color="#E5E5E5"> some mistakes we could locate a QR</font>

353
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,600
code in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-noise image and we can</font>

354
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:24,730
insert<font color="#E5E5E5"> a QR a new image anywhere we want</font>

355
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,340
such as where the old QR code was

356
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:29,800
detected so we can do most of it

357
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:32,230
although<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't do it that well when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

358
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,660
poorly coordinated team resulted in many

359
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:37,480
many merge conflicts and some really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

360
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:40,540
code architecture this is an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

361
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">our committee</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Esther e we see some</font>

362
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:46,150
issues so lessons learned that merge

363
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,440
conflicts can be a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> pain when you</font>

364
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:49,840
have three people who don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

365
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,610
what they're doing it's processing is

366
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,620
pretty difficult when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't know</font>

367
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:55,630
what you're doing but the more dedicated

368
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,930
and experienced individual they could do

369
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:00,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">this easily in under two weeks or so so</font>

370
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:02,739
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we might need to</font>

371
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:06,040
watch out for I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a field</font>

372
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:08,110
test but just doing that and not telling

373
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone felt really sketchy I didn't want</font>

374
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:12,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it I feel like I was breaking some</font>

375
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:14,200
rule so security research going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font>

376
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,360
right I'm gonna call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it research so that</font>

377
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,160
I don't get in trouble and there's stuff

378
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,410
with ethics and research that really

379
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,930
matters is lying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people deceiving</font>

380
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,459
them it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually not very ethical and</font>

381
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:27,160
we also want to see if the same person

382
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,930
scans many QR codes to know hey is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

383
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,390
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people scanning these or is it</font>

384
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:33,609
just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few gullible people and I need to</font>

385
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,460
get IRB certification for an experiment

386
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:38,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I hope</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to someday run which is a</font>

387
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,470
thing for doing ethical research

388
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:44,590
involving people which this involves of

389
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:46,840
course so to do that experiment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

390
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:49,990
created something called redirect log Q

391
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,480
which is a nice name it's just a piece

392
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:54,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">of software it's a server and it will</font>

393
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,200
redirect the user and log the following

394
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:59,020
things the date and time of the redirect

395
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,520
the redirection token which is every

396
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,890
single time we want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> create a URL</font>

397
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,810
redirection token we say hey here's the

398
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:06,599
token

399
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:09,300
no here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the URL it generates a uuid</font>

400
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:11,310
for and converts it to base 62 which is

401
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,319
just everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> caps and</font>

402
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:15,510
lowercase along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the numbers which</font>

403
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:18,149
is a lot easier to look at for<font color="#CCCCCC"> URLs and</font>

404
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:20,939
then a cookie which we just generate a

405
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:24,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">uuid and then give that to the person so</font>

406
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:25,980
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know hey let's see have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you visit our</font>

407
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,170
site multiple times and we built it on

408
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:31,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">Python using classic and Mongo database</font>

409
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:33,360
this time we did it right first Mike

410
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,220
unit I we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just made some skeleton code</font>

411
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,250
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know what every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> single</font>

412
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:41,400
function does and we have a program well

413
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,690
a design we know everyone knows what's

414
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,390
right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't have as many more</font>

415
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:50,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">conflicts and it worked it was amazing</font>

416
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:52,560
and apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of slide so who</font>

417
00:17:50,040 --> 00:18:01,860
has questions for this kind of short

418
00:17:52,560 --> 00:18:08,340
talk feel sorry for him anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

419
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:10,979
question for the experiment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have not</font>

420
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,139
conducted it yet I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get like IRB</font>

421
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,660
ethical research stuff so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

422
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:18,780
actually don't get in trouble for lying

423
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:21,330
to people and maybe kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tracking</font>

424
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,129
users because I could definitely see why
