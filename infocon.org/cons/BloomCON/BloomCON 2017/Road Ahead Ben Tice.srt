something like that but I missed the

59
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,170
first step to finding a solution is

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,078
admitting you have a problem I'm going

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to miss I have rendering problems now</font>

that I've admitted that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can try to</font>

figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out a solution it turns out that</font>

64
00:02:52,360 --> 00:03:05,410
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next line then going back</font>

65
00:02:53,799 --> 00:03:08,920
helps<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there we go so we have a</font>

66
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:11,109
problem so we say we're supposed to be

<font color="#CCCCCC">protecting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> businesses right right now</font>

four hundred billion dollars a year that

70
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:27,790
does not look I yes that does not<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

71
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,099
like we're succeeding to me I think we

72
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">might have a problem okay the rest rate</font>

for computer crime is too low to measure

74
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,549
meaningfully do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have anybody here who</font>

75
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:39,130
does incident response okay we're bunch

76
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:41,200
of them keep your hand up if you your

77
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:46,209
incident response activities regularly

78
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,760
result in arrest here's used to what was

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the not quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

81
00:03:53,919 --> 00:04:00,130
I meant when I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> incident response</font>

82
00:03:55,419 --> 00:04:04,150
right it just doesn't almost never do we

83
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:05,410
actually catch bad guys credit card

84
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,180

85
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,910
ten dollars about so really really

00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:14,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple economics right higher demand</font>

87
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:17,709
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless the demand for really</font>

88
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:20,989
cheap money has gone down raise your

hand if you would like some cheap money

90
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:25,609
okay unless that demand has gone down

91
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:29,900
the fact that you can still go get a

92
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:32,090
credit card number 45 two dollars means

93
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,219
that we are not protecting individuals i

we're failing we can start solving those

125
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,659
of what I'm allowed to do there are

126
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,520
business rules that say we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

127

VPN connections into other offices we

128
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,659
have to have macros because people use

members in here let's consider something

196
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:15,779
somebody was from red team to show up so

ask them how they feel about active

different ways among so many different

is the only company<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know that</font>

212

routinely will ignore security

vulnerability is until they go public so

another one embedded products who here

likes denial of service<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's</font>

businesses vibe I apologize anybody who

227
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,430
works for one of those fenders but most

228
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,990
vendors sell their product even if it's

229
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,729
a good product most of them are but even

230
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,970
if it's a good product they sell it like

231
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:44,220
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the easy button they sell it like</font>

all you have to do is buy our product

233
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,480
and you'll be secure whether it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be our</font>

that buying a product will replace

even if it's all smoke and mirrors right

for example the latest trend right now

290
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:14,368
compliance requirements doesn't even

291
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:17,009
guarantee you a base level of security

292
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:18,119
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really sad because compliance</font>

293
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:20,459
is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things that will push</font>

294
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:22,169
people to actually make their place is

295
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:24,329
secure so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make compliance</font>

296
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:26,609
better we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a lot more places a</font>

297
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:28,019
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more secure and there are no product</font>

298
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:29,819
safety laws right<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason why we have</font>

299
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,079
massive denial of services because we

300
00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:32,519
have insecure products why do you have

301
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:34,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">insecure products because those</font>

302
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:46,439
businesses wanting to cut corners and

303
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:49,889
save money there we go this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pinto</font>

304
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:52,858
this is in my opinion Ford's most famous

305
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:54,509
car if you rear end a Pinto at low

306
00:13:52,859 --> 00:13:56,939
speeds like five miles an hour nice

307
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:58,649
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> fender bender the gas tank</font>

308
00:13:56,939 --> 00:14:03,029
ruptures and the Pinto catches on fire

309
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:06,119
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people died in the from the</font>

310
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:08,579
Pinto that it caused our nation to pass

311
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:10,319
auto safety regulations that meant you

312
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:14,279
weren't allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell a car that would</font>

to be sued when their<font color="#CCCCCC"> product security</font>

00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:32,189
flaws cost somebody else money and

318
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:35,069
lastly our government actively sabotage

319
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:37,949
encryption configuring something like

320
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:40,049
SSH or something like TLS is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> minefield</font>

321
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:42,988
because there are lots of things that

322
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:44,069
are in the standards it has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that have to be supported by the</font>

327
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,529

341
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:19,500
some alarms because yes there is a

342
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,480

346

this country because the NSA built it

this standardized it to put into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch</font>

defend the desktop so recap first step

367
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,910
to finding a solution is admitting you

368
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,379
have a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> the slide I couldn't get</font>

the render pointing out the source of

370
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:41,879
our problems can be with us begin to

371
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:44,009
work on them these are just for examples

372
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:46,019
of reasons why the security industry

373
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:49,350
isn't doing what we hope it does what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

374
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:51,360
feel it should do<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay those were black</font>

375
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,009
of company investment<font color="#CCCCCC"> in secure products</font>

376
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,809
you can't buy a product that secure out

00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:57,389
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually does something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

378
00:16:54,809 --> 00:17:00,059
get minimal a linux server secure out of

379
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:01,889
the box no I doesn't do anything you get

380
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:05,428
linux desktop it's insecure by default

381
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:06,659
because it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> something and you know i</font>

382
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:08,250
love<font color="#E5E5E5"> linux so you know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> picking</font>

383
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:10,709
on it it means there's actually a

384
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,359
problem vendor smell smoke and mirrors

385
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:14,610
and companies will buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and there's</font>

minimal government investment in defense

387
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:26,709
so questions

388
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:28,540
worries fears dreams snide remark I'm i

389
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,980
know i'm a very energetic talker but I'm

390
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:44,290
actually very friendly person so please

391
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:45,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">and ask me questions ok so here's the</font>

00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:48,399
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i agree that we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">security well we also need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

note highly technical things and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the tools we build need a happy</font>

400
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:04,240
user friendly right like the classic

401
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:07,210
example nobody uses PGP why it's or

402
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,620
royal pain in the butt to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it will</font>

403
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:12,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">do you signal why it's not that hard to</font>

404
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,090
use right and there are a lot of systems

405

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to need to be fixed</font>

things that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to need to</font>

411
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,830
going to be secure now instead of being

00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:25,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">insecure so yes user education is</font>

413
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,060
important but we also need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out</font>

414
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,250
a way to protect users<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if they have</font>

415
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,840
not that much education right it's

416
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:35,050
important to protect grandma's credit

417
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:39,820
cards as much as anybody else's other

418
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:41,320
questions we have six<font color="#E5E5E5"> more minutes so if</font>

419
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,520
nobody asked questions i'm going to

420
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:54,939
start telling quantum mechanics chicks

421
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:55,990
look at me you on every time I'm in the

422
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,280
audience and you're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey does</font>

423
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,460
anybody have a question I always ask you

424
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,460
one

425
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:14,280
what was that ain t so audiences

426
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,260
requested to quantum mechanics check so

427
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,879
Schrodinger and Heisenberg or speeding

428
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,320
down the road in the car<font color="#E5E5E5"> they get pulled</font>

429
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,520
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the cops look out says you know</font>

430
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,350
how fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going and Heisenberg</font>

431
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,530
says no but I can tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly where</font>

432
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,909
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it got besides the grounds for a</font>

search so he hasn't popped the trunk hey

00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,870
do you guys know you have a dead
