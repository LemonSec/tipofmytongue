21
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,559
it's very interesting because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has to</font>

22
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,949
do with an Internet service<font color="#E5E5E5"> providers</font>

all the terrible crap that we do can end

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,060
up in the lap of an Internet service

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly what happened in this</font>

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,820
particular case so what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will do is</font>

29
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:23,309
step through who the players are talk

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,649
about the legal claims talk about the

31
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,210
Digital Millennium Copyright Act which

32
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,430
I'm sure many many of you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard</font>

33
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,970
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're going to talk about how</font>

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cox lost immunity under the digital</font>

going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go through a bunch of really</font>

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,970
idiotic internal emails that Cox had

39
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,119
written and sent amongst its trust and

40
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,679
abuse employees and those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the emails</font>

41
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,570
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> caused them to lose this</font>

42
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,899
immunity and then once we get through

43
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,699
that we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> then venture onto this</font>

brave new world of copyright

various unauthorized add-ons so let's

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,590
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this let's talk first about</font>

49
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> players so the players in this</font>

50
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,269
particular case our BMG that people

51
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,340
probably heard of BMG here you know

52
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:20,580
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> they represent artists they</font>

53
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,760
essentially manage copyrights for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge</font>

54
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:27,269
number of artists and specifically music

55
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,730
as well and as you can tell they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a</font>

56
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:33,030
very hip company they've got tattoos

57
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,760
they have coffee<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some of their older</font>

58
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,830
employees even<font color="#E5E5E5"> read magazines so yeah</font>

59
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,849
BMG<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the plaintiff in this particular</font>

60
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:43,379
case but more to the point however<font color="#CCCCCC"> BMG</font>

61
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:46,619
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the plaintiff but the evidence that</font>

62
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:48,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">BMG presented in this particular lawsuit</font>

63
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,760
all came<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a company known as rights</font>

64
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,980
Corp if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't heard of Rights</font>

65
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,959
court what they do is they troll

66
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,209
hundreds of thousands of different

67
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,829
torrents for copyrighted material and

68
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,140
then they begin to tag them and they

69
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:03,329
tracked them and then writes Corp sends

70
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,940
notifications over to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet</font>

72
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,349
with the Virginia Tech t-shirt over here

73
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,829
downloaded Enter Sandman 20 times last

74
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:17,369
night and<font color="#CCCCCC"> now he's about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sued or</font>

75
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:19,139
he can pay a nominal settlement fee of

76
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,940
let's say ten to twenty dollars for his

77
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:25,799
copyright infringement and what well

78
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,329
we'll get into this but essentially they

79
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,239
sent hundreds of thousands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

80
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:33,569
notifications over to cox communications

81
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,069
and it became really difficult to deal

82
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:37,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">with so they just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stopped dealing with</font>

83
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,388
them so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the evidence that BMG</font>

84
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,000
presented really came<font color="#E5E5E5"> from right score</font>

85
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:44,489
but BMG<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the plaintiff here because</font>

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,590
they represent the<font color="#E5E5E5"> artist and the other</font>

ten to twenty dollars per violation and

109
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cox began to ignore those violations</font>

110
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,610
because they claimed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this this</font>

that they would probably you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know let's</font>

00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:35,080
are his ISP and in fact an ISP could be

130
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,000
Bloomsburg University they could be also

131
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,210
considered<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be an Internet service</font>

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,410
provider so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the claims that in</font>

133
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,090
this particular lawsuit there were

134
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:47,800
really only about<font color="#E5E5E5"> fourteen hundred songs</font>

135
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:50,500
at issue and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cox invoked the dmca safe</font>

136
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,890
harbor provision and then they lost that

137
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,240
and so what safe harbor basically is it

138
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,690
says if your internet service provider

139

soon but you know causing a major

147
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:19,479
accident and then somebody suing the car

148
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">dealership from which you bought the car</font>

149
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,990
you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gave you the car we</font>

150
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:26,110
just give you internet service so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

151
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:29,680
what you want at your own peril but you

152
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:32,979
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that particular defense if you</font>

153
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,729
comport with certain reasonable means of

154
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:39,370
notifying others of copyright violations

155
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,400
so there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-week trial and as we</font>

156
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:45,050
mentioned Cox

157
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,969
this immunity and eventually this ended

158
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">up in a verdict against Cox for</font>

159
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:51,889
contributory copyright infringement so

160
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,659
this has never happened before it's a

161
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:56,840
completely new case of first impression

162
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,669
and it has terrified<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet service</font>

163
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,849
providers throughout the country because

164
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:05,359
they think they could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> next so dmca</font>

165
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:08,720
safe harbor in particular 17 USC section

166
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,539
512 this immunity is only going to

167
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,610
provide only<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to apply to service</font>

168
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:16,550
providers as I noted you have to

169
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:18,260
cooperate with copyright owners to

170
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:22,010
address this type of infringement and

171
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:25,190
most importantly the policy has to be

172
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:26,840
reasonably implemented and that's what

173
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,410
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> found to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be lacking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

174
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:33,650
particular case so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cox lost</font>

175
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:37,010
it like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned idiotic internal</font>

176
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:40,370
emails so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look specifically</font>

177
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:43,610
at the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who is responsible for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

178
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:45,770
loss of the safe harbor immunity it is

179
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:48,199
unfortunately and this is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> rare</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

180
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:51,349
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> federal judge to do literally point</font>

181
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:53,330
out one particular person in an opinion

182
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:55,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">over and over and over again and quote</font>

183
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,919
his emails and I do honestly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel</font>

184
00:07:55,909 --> 00:08:01,010
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad for this guy Jason's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BEC</font>

185
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,919
because his name is all over this you

186
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:07,250
can't google it without seeing a load of

187
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,900
crap<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this poor guy so the judge</font>

188
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,780
had said even viewed in the light most

189
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,210
favorable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cox the Court finds the</font>

190
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:17,030
contents of the emails cannot be

191
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,500
explained away that's pretty bad so I'm

192
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,770
setting this up and I hope you find it's

193
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,470
really bad too so Jason's day back after

194
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:27,109
this opinion came out he<font color="#E5E5E5"> did keep his</font>

195
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:30,289
job at<font color="#CCCCCC"> cox for a long time and he was</font>

196
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,959
essentially in charge of panty abuse

197
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:35,689
operations to the trust and abuse type

198
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,880
squad they had over there he did leave

199
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,520
fairly recently and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll show you to</font>

200
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,830
where he went later on but these

201
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,130
particular emails so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an actual</font>

202
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:50,120
email from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jason's abec and I'll read to</font>

203
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:51,920
you some choice bits from this with this

204
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,209
in mind you know as we move forward this

205
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,199
is challenging times we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

206
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:55,910
basically make money

207
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,880
with this in mind if a customer is

208
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,469
terminated for dmca you are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

209
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,450
reactivate them after you<font color="#E5E5E5"> give them a</font>

210
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,460
stern warning about violating the

211
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,680
acceptable use policy and the Digital

212
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,850
Millennium Copyright Act we must still

213
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,380
terminate in order for us to be in

214
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">compliance but once termination is</font>

215
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,939
complete we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> fulfilled our</font>

216
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:18,050
obligation after you reactivate them the

217
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:20,840
DMCA counter restarts and then

218
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:25,160
specifically underlined in red this is

219
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,450
to be an unwritten semi policy well you

220
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,880
know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of you guys are still in</font>

221
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:30,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">college some of you are not the guys in</font>

222
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,920
the soups over there hopefully aren't

223
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:36,320
but here's a little bit of advice

224
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,670
unsolicited legal advice if your company

225
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:43,520
has an unwritten policy don't put it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

226
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:45,770
writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very simple</font>

227
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not that difficult to figure this</font>

228
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,220
out if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say it's an unwritten policy</font>

229
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,950
in an email then it's a written policy

230
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:54,050
and you're screwed<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and and they</font>

231
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,430
cost them a lot of money I'm not saying

232
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:58,069
put your head in the sand<font color="#E5E5E5"> and allow a</font>

233
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:59,390
company to do something untoward you

234
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:02,120
know there's a reason why whistle

235
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:06,560
blowing lines exist I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run one</font>

236
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:08,120
for a huge company<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact but if you're</font>

237
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,099
going to comply with the unwritten

238
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,740
policy don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> write</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it down Christ's</font>

239
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">sakes so an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RG you there's another one</font>

240
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,850
that the judge found very interesting

241
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:19,220
and are GU is actually a customer but

242
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is what Cox this acronym net Cox</font>

243
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,140
has generated for its own customer base

244
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,400
or revenue generating units you don't

245
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,860
have names you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even have customer</font>

246
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:32,270
IDs anymore you're simply a revenue

247
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:35,630
generating unit and the the interest of

248
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:37,400
that talks had in making money is also

249
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,590
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> judge found to be really</font>

250
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,150
sort of inimical to the spirit of

251
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:44,780
compliance with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe harbor</font>

252
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:47,930
provision of the DMCA so<font color="#E5E5E5"> also it's</font>

253
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:50,089
interesting to note here that Jason does

254
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,859
distinguish between you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> das attack</font>

255
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,150
spam and hacking and copyright

256
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,790
violations claiming that will look

257
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:57,319
copyright is not really a big deal as

258
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:01,010
well so the judge probably didn't like

259
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:04,400
that in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion so here's another one</font>

260
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:07,100
another internal email internal info

261
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,640
only do not forward well that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

262
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,530
matter in

263
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,050
in litigation it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be produced</font>

264
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:13,970
unfortunately and again going<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font>

265
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:16,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">the monetary interest that cock says</font>

266
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:18,680
this way he says we can you know

267
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,330
basically returning a customer to

268
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,219
service after they've been terminated

269
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,810
and then make<font color="#CCCCCC"> one phone call back and</font>

270
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,610
say why is my service terminated and

271
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,109
they say well you downloaded some songs

272
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:30,080
now you've called will turn you back on

273
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:33,170
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again they're talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about money</font>

274
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,880
this way we can collect a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> extra</font>

275
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,099
weeks of payment for their account and

276
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,320
then a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little winky smiling and here's a</font>

277
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,960
little bit more unsolicited legal advice

278
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:45,440
that federal judges don't like Winky

279
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:47,210
smileys<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's not a good idea to</font>

280
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">have in any of your communication about</font>

281
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:54,890
sketchy stuff so some more strange

282
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:56,930
emails from<font color="#E5E5E5"> jasons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bank right straight</font>

283
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:59,660
down to the end of this paragraph I mean

284
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:02,449
he literally rights dmca equals

285
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,459
reactivate that is horrible that's like

286
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,620
two diametrically opposed to what you

287
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">are supposed to be doing and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the end</font>

288
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:12,110
you can make them wait a day or so if

289
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:16,130
you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> reactivate a service and</font>

290
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:18,260
again with the winky smiley so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

291
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,140

293
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,600
they're just generally not professional

295
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,730
particularly then so the other thing

that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I probably should have</font>

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and instant messages</font>

00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,910
just jealous because we're young and in

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just an example wouldn't be</font>

303
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:53,599
surprised though but they talk here in

instant messaging channels about soft

305

you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> return them back to</font>

that instant messages are still part of

00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:18,560
litigation you can they can still be

315
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:20,240
discovered very very easily don't think

316
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,229
because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not on official email</font>

that

all your communications are not going to

326
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,300
there is a lot more functionality with

respect to the retention of information

companies all of those communications

00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:01,430
whether they are internal or external

335
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:03,380
will very very likely be<font color="#E5E5E5"> logged unless</font>

336
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,000
you're on your your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own device and</font>

337
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,290
you're using some kind of encrypted

end-to-end communication<font color="#CCCCCC"> permit</font>

339
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,880
something like liquor telegram signal

340
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:13,610
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> even then if the litigation gets</font>

341
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,870
hairy enough as I've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font>

342
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,420
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> investigations and</font>

343
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,460
specifically with programs like silent

344
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,949
circle even if the messages themselves

345
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:24,320
are burned there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> still be little</font>

346
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:26,930
traces in the database of the messages

347
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,850
about when they were sent and to whom so

348
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:32,989
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> still collect metadata and that</font>

349
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:36,230
metadata can be very damning so again

350
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:39,350
here with the instant messages really

351
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:41,150
bad stuff under the table procedure the

352
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:44,930
kind of stuff that you really never want

353
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:47,030
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put in writing so eventually after</font>

354
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:50,270
the judge had ruled on the basis of

355
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:52,220
these idiotic internal emails that Cox

356
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:54,829
was no longer entitled to the safe

357
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,480
harbor immunity defense this went to a

358
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">two-week trial and this is the actual</font>

359
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,190
verdict form and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will step through</font>

360
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,720
this process so what was presented to

361
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,190
the jury was essentially a series of

362
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,050
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and won't go through three of</font>

above captioned action answer the

00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:12,050
question submitted to us as followed

366
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:13,820
direct infringement the BMG proved by a

367
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,459
preponderance of the evidence that<font color="#E5E5E5"> users</font>

368
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:19,760
of cox internet service use that service

369
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:22,190
to infringe BMG copyrighted works that's

370
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,890
a long-winded way of asking did anybody

371
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:26,930
on Cox's<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and free download</font>

372
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:29,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">copyrighted material so that the answer</font>

373
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:32,560
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really surprisingly yes of course</font>

374
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:35,380
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the first step in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

375
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,479
contributory infringement this is where

376
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:40,600
it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot more difficult for for</font>

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,000
cox-2 dmg<font color="#E5E5E5"> proved by a preponderance of</font>

the evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cox is liable for</font>

379
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,980
contributory infringement of BMG

380
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,779
copyrighted works and I'm sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

381
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,720
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change their rubber pants when</font>

382
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:57,339
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw the answer yes that is not good</font>

383
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:00,460
and willfulness very bad this is a

384
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:01,930
precursor<font color="#CCCCCC"> to damages the DM the BMG crew</font>

385
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:05,260
by preponderance of the evidence that

386
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:08,410
Cox his conduct was willful and the

387
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:11,230
basis of the willful finding had to be

388
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:13,719
those idiotic internal emails and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

389
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:16,450
answer was yes so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where it gets</font>

390
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,760
bad and then damages what's the total

391
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:22,600
amount of statutory damages that you

392
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,310
award to BMG 25 million dollars that's a

393
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,500
lot to be out of pocket especially if

394
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,819
you're a smaller<font color="#E5E5E5"> is peacock said 3.5</font>

395
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,980
million subscribers they could absorb

396
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,960
this and just rebuild back somehow and

397
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:34,029
some unnecessary tax<font color="#E5E5E5"> to charge their</font>

398
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,100
customers more likely but you know the

399
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:37,390
smaller ISPs like we have here in

400
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,030
Pennsylvania I'm not sure if it's blue

401
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:42,400
ridge in here in<font color="#CCCCCC"> bloomsburg but at my</font>

402
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:44,650
place a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> farther east of here it</font>

403
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:48,610
is and that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tough for them</font>

404
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:51,040
so yeah this was this was bad so Jason

405
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:53,500
actually moved on last year about six

406
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,480
months ago or so he<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally left Cox and</font>

407
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,839
he became an associate director of cyber

408
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:02,110
security at IIT I didn't know what IIT

409
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:04,480
was but I was a little interested to

410
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:06,130
learn that it was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a veteran</font>

411
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,339
don't small business<font color="#CCCCCC"> specializing in</font>

412
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:11,079
critical infrastructure protection you

413
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:12,609
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a mouth like that he</font>

414
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,819
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> working for a Senate Select</font>

415
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:18,069
Committee on Intelligence but no such

416
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:20,589
luck instead he's protecting critical

417
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:23,109
infrastructure all kidding aside though

418
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:24,760
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I do feel bad for this guy's de</font>

419
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:27,760
Becque I think he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a really bad rap</font>

420
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,080
but he did some really silly things and

421
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,390
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be very difficult</font>

422
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,879
for him to ever recover his career

423
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:38,260
entirely so is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something really could</font>

424
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:42,310
think about so the implications of this

425
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:44,350
are are definitely far and wide I hate

426
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:47,200
to use that platitude but I just did

427
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:48,549
but like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned earlier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SPS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

428
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,090
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very concerned about</font>

429
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:54,400
contributory liability this case not

430
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:57,039
surprisingly is on appeal at the moment

431
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,770
in the Fourth Circuit and there are

432
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,650
several amici curiae I or friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

433
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:06,370
court briefs and the eff filed a

434
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:08,470
particular amicus brief the thrust of it

435
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,820
essentially the eff brief was actually

436
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:11,679
very interesting in the sense that they

437
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,389

<font color="#E5E5E5">not one party or the other should win</font>

439
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:18,250
but they wanted to caution the Fourth

440
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:21,669
Circuit panel reviewing the case that

441
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:26,500
the termination of somebody's internet

442
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:28,240
service you know could have a great or

443
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,760
rather could cause great damage to an

444
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,010
individual user especially when it comes

445
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,539
to economics if somebody is reliant on

00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,158
this for their job if they're reliant on

447
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:40,270
this for education if they're reliant on

448
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,590
an ISP for their children things like

449
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,900
that just really nearly shutting off

450
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:46,090
customers internet service is a really

451
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,220
bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that should be flexible enough</font>

452
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:53,500
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> account for something like the DMCA</font>

453
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:54,850
and that you know they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">take a position one way or the other is</font>

somebody who should win but they need

456
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:02,739
that judges need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give this a great</font>

457
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,870
deal of thought and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you had saw a</font>

lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other briefs from from places</font>

459
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,110
like Library Association's and

460
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,440
universities that are concerned with

461
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:14,139
contributory liability causing them

462
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,600
essentially to provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> to its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> users a</font>

that would prevent people from doing

00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:23,620
certain types of research certain types

<font color="#E5E5E5">of analyses that would essentially be</font>

471
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,770
know document retention policies for

00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:40,570
isps namely that's a fancy way of saying

473
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:44,260
how long do you have to hold on to

474
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:46,658
damaging emails like Jason's so I am

475
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:49,120
sure that document retention policies

476
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:52,450
have been revised several times in light

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular decision and we may</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">see more short-term compliance with</font>

00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:57,879
these demand letters from right score

480
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,469
more forward than forwarding over to

481
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,890
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual users and then some</font>

482
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:08,260
legislative implications but more to the

483
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:09,940
point for today this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular case BMG</font>

484
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,040
peacocks had to deal with torrents and

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,870
the brave new<font color="#CCCCCC"> world of copyright</font>

487
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:18,070
through streaming services and mainly a

488
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,470
lot of things like the Cody<font color="#E5E5E5"> add-ons</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about Exodus Phoenix salt that</font>

00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:27,730
kind of stuff so<font color="#CCCCCC"> other implications here</font>

491
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:29,770
this could reach over to hosting

providers anybody who is a website host

493
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,760
right the same legal reasoning can

494
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,890
actually apply to them it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can also apply</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people or organizations like</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">CloudFlare who operate content</font>

498
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:47,889
if they have knowledge that somebody is

using their networks to engage in the

500

<font color="#CCCCCC">distribution of copyrighted materials</font>

501
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,200

considered in<font color="#CCCCCC"> short service provider</font>

eye to what your users are<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing they</font>

505
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:05,140
could see their immunity stripped from

them and we've had we deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a lot of</font>

copyright enforcement stuff as well

within our firm and and take down the

509
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,510
one night<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have seen quite a lot</font>

518
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:35,320
lawyers so let's talk specifically about

519
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:38,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cody so Cody so by show of hands here</font>

520
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,840
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have used Cody so quite</font>

521
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:42,580
a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you and is there anybody well</font>

522
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,750
let me explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> I won't cause anybody to</font>

523
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,610
raise their hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't know what</font>

524
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,780
Kody is weak Cody is essentially if you

525
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:49,360
don't know what it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's essentially a</font>

526
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,370
media player and it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be side-loaded</font>

527
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,139
on any number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different devices the</font>

528
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:55,600
most popular one over the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

529
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,010
say year there's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon fire</font>

530

531
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:01,660
bucks you saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> it load Cody on it and</font>

532
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:04,419
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great media player used to</font>

533
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,670
be called XBMC it's got a really simple

534
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,830
elegant user interface and it's

535
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:10,510
incredibly<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to sideload once you</font>

536
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,710
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cody loaded a whole bunch of</font>

537
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:15,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">unauthorized add-on</font>

538
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:18,850
things like Exodus Phoenix stream all

539
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:21,250
the sources salt movie HD is a new one

540
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:23,110
that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty effective but</font>

541
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,120
what these allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to do is identify</font>

542
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:31,389
all these different servers that stream

543
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:34,750
copyrighted material and it's incredibly

544
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:36,429
efficient it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is I know</font>

545
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:41,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that work in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cable industry</font>

546
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:42,880

547
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,190
cody all the time at<font color="#E5E5E5"> home because it's</font>

548
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,350
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> simpler to use then turning on</font>

549
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:50,830
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> cable box and navigating you know</font>

550
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:52,510
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know HBO directv all this</font>

551
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,799
nonsense you know the user interfaces

552
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,629
for thing they're so desperate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font>

553
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:57,668
and wide that<font color="#CCCCCC"> cody allows you to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

554
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:59,080
everything in one spot so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people</font>

555
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:02,409
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> using it and it's a really great</font>

556
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,449
program and one important point here is

557
00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:06,279
that cody is just a media player and it

558
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,679
has taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> great pains to disassociate</font>

559
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:13,240
itself from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual work of the</font>

560
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:16,059
infringers and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly streaming and</font>

561
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,909
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this in this particular bullet</font>

562
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:20,799
point that because i have i have found

563
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:22,570
out recently that sometimes some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

564
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,740
these cody add-ons they look as if

565
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're streaming but they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

566
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,990
torrenting so streaming from netflix if

567
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:31,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">your if let's say if you're sniffing</font>

568
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:34,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">package it's not going to look all that</font>

569
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:35,408
dissimilar except the source IP is going

570
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:36,969
to be different obviously between

571
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:40,840
streaming from netflix and streaming

572
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:43,450
from Exodus so Cody right now is a much

573
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,970
bigger problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the ISPs because</font>

574
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're there's sort of a people are</font>

575
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,750
turning their backs on torrenting to a

576
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,340
very large extent and you have ordinary

577
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,549
users people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wouldn't normally</font>

578
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:56,350
torrent that are using<font color="#CCCCCC"> cody for all of</font>

579
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:57,820
their media resources so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

580
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,529

588
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:22,059
to involve internal and external counsel

589
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:24,909
so all of the stuff that Jason's<font color="#CCCCCC"> abec</font>

put in emails that were discovered

a reasonable means by which to claim

600
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:46,869

601
00:24:44,739 --> 00:24:48,909
discussions about the MCA compliance are

602
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:51,459
going to be protected by legal privilege

you're lucky enough to live in a

we're definitely going to see is a

revision of privacy policies and this

633
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,759
may also depend in large part on how the

635

actually permit collection of data with

respect to its customers a little bit

637

more freely and even things like deep

638

packet inspection so isp monitoring and

that Exodus hosted some servers but they

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,999
know where<font color="#CCCCCC"> these servers are located and</font>

676
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:13,769
then once you have a listing of these

677
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:15,749
particular customers that are connecting

678
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:17,609
to these particular endpoints then you

679
00:28:15,749 --> 00:28:19,799
start to track their mac address and

680
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:23,100
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at whether the</font>

684
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,690
suggested we ever shut off their

686
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:36,960
on a day later and then and this would

<font color="#CCCCCC">be the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of all possible worlds I</font>

00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:46,259
almost like an insurance evaluation was

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,820
a part of an underwriting process so

692

let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you assign a risk level to</font>

698
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:04,679
of deep packet inspection and then if it

very reluctant to<font color="#CCCCCC"> quote-unquote spy on</font>

732
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,590
their customers and they do not want to

00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:33,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">garner an obligation amongst themselves</font>

736
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,540
under dmca is that they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

737
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,820
that so if they do this widespread

738
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:45,330
monitoring they essentially will be

739
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:48,270
assuming that obligation so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this</font>

740
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:50,909
even a possible alternative it seems

00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:54,360
totally crazy but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhat</font>

likely the short<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer here is money so</font>

00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:00,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">on 7 March using something called the</font>

weeks ago

746
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:07,639
Senate Republicans i think it was

747
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:12,709
sponsored by Marquis had actually

748
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:15,890
promulgated a scheme that was in fact

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday passed by the Senate to</font>

so in plain English the FCC<font color="#E5E5E5"> promulgated</font>

753
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:31,760
some rules they send out some rules that

754
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:33,379
said ISPs<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not allowed to spy on</font>

755
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,560

00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:45,169
they have the explicit opt-in of a

759
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:49,520
customer and this turns this entirely on

760

its head so by Congress<font color="#CCCCCC"> mella fying the</font>

that if this passes the house now the

<font color="#CCCCCC">FCC will actually also be prevented from</font>

usage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook and data and then</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">with any of your applications on your</font>

yesterday in the Senate and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to go to the house so it's something</font>

00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:00,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we should all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be monitoring</font>

787
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,480
quite closely but yeah obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

788
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:04,820
is a lot happening in the news lately so

789
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,880
this doesn't take front<font color="#E5E5E5"> and center stage</font>

790
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:10,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">FCC rule making abilities is not really</font>

791
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,880
a sexy topic so how would this work

792
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:15,830
though because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they can monetize this</font>

793
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,190
how would this fit<font color="#CCCCCC"> into let's say</font>

794
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:22,189
a function of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP well we've got a</font>

795
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:24,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of very interesting concepts here</font>

796
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:28,039
because if this goes through and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs</font>

797
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:30,320
can monetize our data then a compliance

798
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:33,140
function that was namely just an expense

799
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,928
for an ISP could actually be turned into

800
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:41,240
a revenue generating unit so to speak

801
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:43,220
and in so doing the ISPs could appease

802
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,260
the motion picture association of

803
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:48,649
america<font color="#E5E5E5"> utilized deep packet inspection</font>

804
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:51,710
and then sell are browsing history our

805
00:33:48,649 --> 00:33:54,080
application usage history the the

806
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:56,090

807
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,418
communicating at any particular time to

third parties to data brokers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

809
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:06,799
sense this could be sold to a data

810
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:08,509
broker and that data broker let's say

811
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,909
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that happens to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

812
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:14,750
foreign<font color="#CCCCCC"> entity could then sell it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

813
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:16,129
to the government so you know I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

814
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:18,918
suggesting that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the ultimate</font>

815
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:22,250
play by Congress<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it could be an end</font>

816
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:23,929
run around something like a warrant

817
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:28,310
requirement depending upon how<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data</font>

818
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:30,470
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> anonymized if at all but you know</font>

819
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:32,570
this would all happen at the expense of

820
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:35,000
user privacy would be degraded but

821
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,889
according to Congress no more so<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

822
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,780
our privacy is already degraded when we

823
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:40,730
use gmail when we use Google when we use

824
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook but there is a huge difference</font>

825
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:46,730
between our usage of social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

826
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:48,949
email and linking browser history to

827
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:52,129
individual people to individual families

828
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:55,310
and then monetizing that data so far

829
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:57,920
from putting ISPs on equal footing with

830
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:59,390
website operators I think there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

831
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,580
reasonable argument that this

832
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:05,750
nullification of the FCC's<font color="#E5E5E5"> rulemaking</font>

833
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:08,509
process actually gives ISPs a huge leg

834
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:10,730
up on people like Google<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Facebook in</font>

835
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:12,589
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to monetize our data because</font>

836
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:14,960
Google and Facebook only have data<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

837
00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:18,070
Google and Facebook are ISPs have data

838
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">about everything</font>

839
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:25,288
yes speculate but possible that's my

840
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:29,848
point there so what's happening already

841
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:33,420
is quite interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well so Cody and</font>

842
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:36,210
Cody boxes as they are erroneously

843
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:38,130
turned or and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the world and</font>

844
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:41,640
especially in the UK there is already

845
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:42,960
server level blocking happening and this

846
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">is sort of an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting story because</font>

847
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,819
this has to do with streaming services

848
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:50,250
for live events in the UK so the Premier

849
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:52,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">League football teams are you know</font>

850
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:57,150
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody watches in the UK</font>

00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,960
required blocking orders for

872
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:50,880
counterfeiters and what the judge said

873
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,380
was based on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> heels of that ruling or</font>

874
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,950
rather maybe even on the shoulders of it

875
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:58,740
they ordered targeted blocking on a

876
00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:00,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">real-time basis of the servers that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

877
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:03,660
streaming these live Premier League

878
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:07,380
football games into the pubs and so this

879
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:09,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">is happening right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now as many of you</font>

880
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:12,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably are thinking already you don't</font>

881
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,220
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great level of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> technical skill to</font>

882
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:17,009
get around a blocking order like this

883
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,959
simply pop out somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> else going to</font>

884
00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:20,910
use a VPN pop out the United States

885
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,559
streaming through as long as your ISP

886
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:25,348
gives you enough bandwidth you're good

887
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:27,660
to go but pub owners are not known for

888
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:29,860
their technical acumen sometimes so this

889
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,960
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be somewhat effective yet</font>

890
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:34,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">he however remains to be seen</font>

891
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:38,410
nonetheless it is a very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to be</font>

892
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:41,140
in the VPN business so let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

893
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:43,750
that so three general categories here

894
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:45,730
VPNs proxies renata misers and use of

895
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:47,560
others networks proxies and auto misers

896
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,970
have always been pretty effective at

897
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,620
this but they're not going to encrypt

898
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:53,230
any of your packets going back and forth

899
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:56,920
use of others networks at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point who</font>

900
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:58,660
cares<font color="#CCCCCC"> what happens to them but this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

901
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,940
sort of going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the point that the</font>

902
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:03,879
eff was making in their amicus brief to

903
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:05,620
the Fourth Circuit which is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

904
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,900
going to shut off somebody's internet

905
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:10,839
service on the basis of some minor and

906
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,400
fringing activity you may not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

907
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,340
real evidence that that particular

908

person engaged in copyright violations

909
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:19,570
and there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> instances that we</font>

910
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,090
have researched anticipation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

911
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:24,580
talk where raids have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> conducted and</font>

912
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:26,470
then when the authorities show up they

913
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:28,509
realize oh well this family had an

914
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:33,100
unsecured Wi-Fi network and this

915
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:34,690
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't them but VPNs are going</font>

916
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,670
to I think be big business for people

917
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:39,940
they're going to be pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> effective to</font>

918
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:41,890
throw it at least you know ISPs looking

919
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:44,620
for targeted<font color="#E5E5E5"> suspicion to then engage in</font>

920
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:46,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">dpi but I think it's important</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

921
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:48,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">the people who use a lot of these free</font>

922
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:50,410
VPN services don't realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact</font>

923
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:54,400
they could be leaking a hell of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

924
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:57,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">data about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their connections as well and</font>

925
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,580
VPNs as we just noted are going to be

926
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:02,290
probably quite likely effective at

927
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:05,319
obviating these particular blocking

928
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:08,230
orders as well because they're not

929
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:10,990
targeting the what the blocking orders

930
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:14,170
do is they don't target the actual

931
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:16,089
server that is doing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> streaming they</font>

932
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:17,740
tell the ISPs you're not allowed to

933
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:20,740
allow traffic from this particular

934
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:22,330
server at this particular time so if you

935
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:25,419
go through a different isp you get

936
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:28,990
around the blocking order so a couple of

937
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:30,490
conclusions here copyright infringement

938
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:32,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially contributory copyright</font>

939
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:36,189
infringement is going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very costly</font>

940
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:37,839
if this decision is upheld by the Fourth

941
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,980
Circuit and there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a lot of</font>

00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,860
changes coming down the pipeline

943
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,930
employee chatter is a huge issue

careful<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it and if things like deep</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">especially when all of our ISPs and</font>

964
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:38,589
cable companies are continually merging

965
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:43,029
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have only one choice and</font>

users you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are sort of hurtling</font>

towards a world where there's widespread

surveillance and all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our activities</font>

971

and will very likely have a chilling

chilling effect on our freedoms of

foresee very serious legal challenges

the eff against this kind of monitoring

978
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:12,850
of by ISPs so in that sense they may not

you purchased it so in that sense it

could be an<font color="#CCCCCC"> enron around that and data</font>

the stuff that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> collect can be</font>

really pernicious and they will sell to

ways that governments can masquerade as

also becomes a scary endeavor so you

00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,680
very likely not restrict to whom they

1017
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,109
could sell this data aside from people

1018
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,940
being on the OFAC list or you know the

1019
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:10,348
list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know you're not</font>

1020
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">allowed to do business with because they</font>

1021
00:43:10,349 --> 00:43:14,400
support terrorism or any other sort of

1022
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,980
endeavor that's bad for the United

1023
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,660
States<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I can see this data running</font>

1024
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:21,000
into the hands of we're getting into the

1025
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:22,529
hands of many third parties that would

1026
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,210
find a very valuable and law enforcement

1027
00:43:22,529 --> 00:43:26,210
is definitely one of those entities

1028
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:51,259
yeah hold up binaries not pictures done

1029
00:43:48,710 --> 00:44:12,260
erotica yeah I remember yeah of course

1030
00:43:51,260 --> 00:44:13,730
yep right yeah so if you didn't hear

1031
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,140
them the back is saying it basically

1032
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:17,630
these Usenet groups that have existed

1033
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:19,790
since you know the probably late 80s

1034
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:21,470
Early 90s I think are still being used

1035
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:23,240
to distribute files and and quite

1036
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:24,439
effectively and this interesting I

1037
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't played with that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot but a lot</font>

1038
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,770
of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> telling me that</font>

1039
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:31,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">these Usenet groups are really effective</font>

1040
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:32,839
at distributing file and that could be

1041
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:36,529
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to go utilizing ssl connection</font>

1042
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:39,470
so so the stream of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is encrypted</font>

1043
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:42,020
and to end it's an interesting you

1044
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:43,700
mention a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tube</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because that use of SSL</font>

1045
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:46,040
i'm not aware that it happens at all

1046
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:48,439
through any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these cody add-ons but</font>

1047
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,270
that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be one way of flirting some</font>

1048
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,940
of this deep packet inspection as well

1049
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:56,450
in addition to VPNs<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could completely</font>

1050
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:59,270
see that but the problem is so long as

1051
00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:01,609
it stays somewhat low on the radar or it

1052
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:03,740
has a threshold level of technical

1053
00:45:01,609 --> 00:45:06,529
expertise that normal people cannot

1054
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:08,509
reach once it becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> too user-friendly</font>

1055
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:11,270
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> cody then it gets on the</font>

1056
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:12,560
radar of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mpaa and RI double-a and</font>

1057
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:15,109
that's when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to see some</font>

1058
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:17,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of crackdown but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think for now</font>

1059
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:19,250
you're right this stuff has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

1060
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:21,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a long time and is definitely off</font>

1061
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:22,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">the radar and it'd be very easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font>

1062
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:24,319
difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> track specially if you're</font>

1063
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:26,990
connecting to these use nets with using

1064
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:30,140
VPN as well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that's an</font>

1065
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:32,359
excellent point but again in response if

1066
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:37,609
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> becomes too easy then you're going to</font>

1067
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:40,150
see enforcement yes you know absolutely

1068
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,150
sir

1069
00:45:40,290 --> 00:46:11,279
but that's a really great point it if

1070
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:13,740
you didn't hear it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1071
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,900
you know right now we're focusing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1072
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:18,299
contributory liability of the ISPs and

1073
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,920
if the VPN has become the enablers of

1074
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,750
copyright infringement you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1075
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,800
see legal action taken against them and

1076
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:29,460
that's an excellent point they all

1077
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:33,420
advertised essentially in ways that make

1078
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:36,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">it very clear that they are designed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1079
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,980
thwart legal process we don't have logs

1080
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,050
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundreds of users at any time</font>

1081
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:42,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any particular server no action could</font>

1082
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:45,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">be traced back to you all of this stuff</font>

1083
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:46,260
and quite frankly it really is an

1084
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,109
excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> point because a lawsuit</font>

1085
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:52,260
against a VPN provider these guys aren't

1086
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:53,580
huge money makers right so they had to

1087
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,740
defend against the contributory

1088
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:57,810
copyright infringement suit and I didn't

1089
00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:01,350
let's say have insurance to pick up the

1090
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:04,080
tab just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense of that suit could</font>

1091
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:08,279
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> them out of business I could</font>

1092
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:10,380
completely see that however I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1093
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,330
you know there are there would be some

1094
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:16,080
legal precedent cutting the other way as

1095
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:20,069
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> that VPN providers could utilize</font>

1096
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:22,560
with respect to let's say registrar's

1097
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:24,090
registrar's of domain names we just

1098
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,740
provide a service we give you a domain

1099
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:28,260
name what you do with it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you know</font>

1100
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:32,939
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing they could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also then you try</font>

1101
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:34,650
to rely on dmca safe harbor immunity and

1102
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:37,110
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we're just a privacy</font>

1103
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:41,040
service and that that's all we're all

1104
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:42,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">about is privacy but i would love to</font>

1105
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,550
litigate one of those gay I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> love</font>

1106
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:46,140
to defend that for a VPN provider I

1107
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:48,680
think would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be kind of a cool suit so</font>

1108
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:54,920
thank you for that question sir

1109
00:47:48,680 --> 00:48:09,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">I angel Monticello think it was</font>

1110
00:47:54,920 --> 00:48:11,750
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like kinky work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

1111
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:19,940
difficult i square one and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did was</font>

1112
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:21,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">plan yep that's exactly right I mean and</font>

1113
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:23,450
other people can do this to other

1114
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,089
people's networks as well I mean

1115
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:30,799
teamviewer is a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive attack</font>

1116
00:48:26,089 --> 00:48:32,420
vector for breaches either and I've seen

1117
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,280
it personally used for very malicious

1118
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:37,880
purposes<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could have somebody team</font>

1119
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:38,869
viewing into your computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're 65 or</font>

1120
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,280
a woman you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize you have</font>

1121
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:43,069
teamviewer installed so that the world

1122
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,569
can connect and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> your machine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1123
00:48:43,069 --> 00:48:46,190
used for copyright infringement<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

1124
00:48:44,569 --> 00:48:48,380
you're the person whose subject to

1125
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:49,730
termination of an ISP and and that's

1126
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:52,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the electronic frontier is</font>

1127
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:55,609
foundations brief<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think was hinting at</font>

1128
00:48:52,339 --> 00:48:58,040
that you need to have more than the sort

1129
00:48:55,609 --> 00:48:59,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you know circumstantial suspicions</font>

1130
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:02,930
about what people are doing on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a network</font>

1131
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:06,410
before you turn off their internet

1132
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:07,520
service and so yeah look what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

1133
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:09,740
was essentially you know what you would

1134
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,240
do with a VPN you know you're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Africa</font>

1135
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:13,549
you're in Ghana or<font color="#E5E5E5"> someplace like that</font>

1136
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,558
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> access paypal and you pop into</font>

1137
00:49:13,549 --> 00:49:17,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">the United States a server in new york</font>

1138
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:19,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">and new jersey and you then have access</font>

1139
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:21,950
when I lived in<font color="#E5E5E5"> London I had to do that</font>

1140
00:49:19,099 --> 00:49:25,549
before I move back to sign up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1141
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:30,759
Obamacare so yeah I totally get it

1142
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:30,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">excellent question sir</font>

1143
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:10,790
probably not right so for anyone who

1144
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:13,069
didn't hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully everyone did I</font>

1145
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:14,240
think a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really excellent point was was</font>

1146
00:50:13,069 --> 00:50:15,920
brought up that you know once you're

1147
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,000
looking at application level data and

1148
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,130
you see what's going through the

1149
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,220
pipeline you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> begin to throttle that</font>

1150
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:23,450
particular pipeline as well really

1151
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,740
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great point it's actually</font>

1152
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:28,368
something I frankly hadn't thought about

1153
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:30,410
and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point it let's say an ISP is</font>

1154
00:50:28,369 --> 00:50:32,599
utilizing DTI and they find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1155
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:34,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">is an active connection to a server</font>

1156
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:38,359
that's known to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used by Exodus to</font>

1157
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:40,040
stream the Snowden movie then you can

1158
00:50:38,359 --> 00:50:42,259
just throttle that bandwidth and make

1159
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:44,329
the stream completely unusable and you

1160
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:47,329
destroy the viability of all of these

1161
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:50,630
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> cody add-ons so yeah I think</font>

1162
00:50:47,329 --> 00:50:52,460
it really really excellent point and you

1163
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:55,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're you had to follow up question</font>

1164
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,329
with that was it

1165
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:24,450
mmhmm yeah yeah yeah so if they become

1166
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:28,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the backbone and then have access to</font>

1167
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:30,060
huge amount of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know then I</font>

1168
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:32,670
think you have a very good argument for

1169
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:35,160
the widespread use of DPI to generate

1170
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:37,440
huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> amounts of revenue for that</font>

1171
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:39,270
particular company and that's a

1172
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,570
dangerous thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and they could a sway</font>

1173
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:44,490
jar you know the privacy advocates by

1174
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:46,380
saying things like well we will

1175
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:48,299
anonymize it to a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> extent right</font>

1176
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:51,120
but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that anonymized data can be</font>

1177
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:53,250
d<font color="#CCCCCC"> anonymized by reference you know but</font>

1178
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:57,330
and but simple things like link analysis

1179
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:59,490
so that may work with the layman but I

1180
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:02,130
think for real privacy advocates for

1181
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:04,770
die-hard technical people who understand

1182
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:07,290
how this work we know that there's

1183
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:08,670
essentially full of crap so I think

1184
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,650
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that's a dangerous proposition</font>

1185
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:12,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would hate to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see deep packet</font>

1186
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:26,400
inspection utilized in such a widespread

1187
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:30,000
basis all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back sir the</font>

1189
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,880

1190
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:37,380
extension the second right yeah it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave</font>

1191
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,350
me quite possibly we know what's on your

1192
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:44,430
mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right yeah don't sit next</font>

1193
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:48,870
to him at lunch all right I I think

1194
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:50,460
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> right because it once you well</font>

1195
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:54,779
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing interesting</font>

1196
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:56,760
thing with surveillance right<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah and</font>

1197
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:58,680
going back to Snowden you this is an

1198
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:01,440
unpopular position to take but i think

1199
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:03,690
what Snowden did arguably not saying

1200
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,640
this is right but what Snowden did by

1201
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:09,120
revealing the fact that the surveillance

1202
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:10,770
is happening he actually caused the

1203
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:13,350
chilling effect from the surveillance so

1204
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:16,200
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know about surveillance then we</font>

1205
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:17,910
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our associations</font>

1206
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,560
and that's how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had there's a chilling</font>

1207
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:21,660
effect so in the nineteen eighty-four

1208
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:23,578
situation where we have telescreens and

1209
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:25,259
their surveillance pervasively all

1210
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:27,630
around us it's ubiquitous we can't get

1211
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:29,160
away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from it and we know that then we're</font>

1212
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:30,990
there's going to be a chilling effect on

1213
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,930
our freedoms of association the freedom

1214
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:35,609
of the press and and the freedom of

1215
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:37,109
speech we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be very careful</font>

1216
00:53:35,609 --> 00:53:38,700
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we say in any particular</font>

1217
00:53:37,109 --> 00:53:41,790
context when we know that there's

1218
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:43,439
monitoring right so is it it would it be

1219
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:44,880
a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing if we knew it then if we</font>

1220
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,910
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to change our</font>

1221
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,970
behaviors if we don't know about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1222
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:52,560
we can be caught for it but at least we

1223
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:54,089
hadn't changed our behaviors and it

1224
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:57,180
hasn't had an effect on civil liberties

1225
00:53:54,089 --> 00:53:58,619
so in a situation that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gentleman</font>

1226
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:02,430
with the ponytail and the plaid in the

1227
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:04,530
back had mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in that</font>

1228
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:06,029
situation we probably would know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1229
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:08,820
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular type of surveillance</font>

1230
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:10,470
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be surveillance through</font>

1231
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:13,109
a deep packet inspection ostensibly

1232
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:15,480
through an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP as then bought and sold</font>

1233
00:54:13,109 --> 00:54:18,810
through other data brokers so be very

1234
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:21,660
easy even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was secretive to uncover</font>

1235
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:24,509
the fact that it's happening and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1236
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:25,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">that could be really bad you know I</font>

1237
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:30,540
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got enough surveillance</font>

1238
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:32,130
pervasively around us<font color="#E5E5E5"> today you know to</font>

1239
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:36,450
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> us all busy I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we need</font>

1240
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:46,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">more well yeah so thank you for that sir</font>

1241
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:48,540
I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea yeah net neutrality sure</font>

1242
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:52,078
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if the net neutrality rules</font>

1243
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:55,259
were affected in such a way that you

1244
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,450
know that certain bandwidth would lean

1245
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:59,490
towards the you know the big media

1246
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:02,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">companies and things and again it would</font>

1247
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:04,799
essentially amount to a throttling of

1248
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:06,420
the particular servers that are used to

1249
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,700
stream copyrighted materials and things

1250
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:11,609
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it would be probably</font>

1251
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:13,740
another way that they could try to

1252
00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:18,509
destroy the viability of these

1253
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:21,410
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> cody add-ons the other guy in</font>

1254
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:21,410
plaid all right

1255
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:41,940
yeah so if if DPI became the norm you

1256
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:44,160
know what are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> countermeasures at</font>

1257
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">codys going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get short I mean it goes</font>

1258
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,819
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to one of the questions I think</font>

1259
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:49,980
that we were answering as well or

1260
00:55:47,819 --> 00:55:52,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually comment about usenet now</font>

1261
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:54,809
perhaps what Cody would do then is

1262
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:56,190
implement SSL so that you know the

1263
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:58,170
connections between the streaming

1264
00:55:56,190 --> 00:56:00,480
servers and the users you know were

1265
00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:02,400
implemented through<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL so it becomes</font>

1266
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,619
more difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to engage in deep packet</font>

1267
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,329
inspection of that particular time but

1268
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:07,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">again to go back to deep packet</font>

1269
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:09,210
inspection we're talking about

1270
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:11,220
application level data you're still

1271
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:13,200
going to get the TCP and IP level data

1272
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:15,450
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless they are constantly</font>

1273
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:18,629
changing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the location of these servers</font>

1274
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:20,339
and then having<font color="#CCCCCC"> the add-ons made up be</font>

1275
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:22,319
made aware of the location of those

1276
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:27,420
servers I think it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be tricky</font>

1277
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:29,130
to not have an ISP get wind of the fact

1278
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:31,260
that a particular user if they're

1279
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:37,170
monitoring is streaming copyrighted

1280
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:38,910
content know anything else guys well

1281
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:40,230
great I thank you guys so much for the

1282
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:42,299
really great questions there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a</font>

00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,039
lot of fun to present to you I'm Alex

this is my law partner Justin over here

1285
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:49,500
come talk to us we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be around thank</font>
