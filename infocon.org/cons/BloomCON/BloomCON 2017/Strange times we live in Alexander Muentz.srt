the person getting squat

154
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:19,970
but that resonates with us right oh I

155
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,740
know some of us are criminals and i'm

156
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,829

because ok ok so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> wastes are just in</font>

161
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:47,719
my just making sure otherwise just<font color="#E5E5E5"> shame</font>

164
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:58,878
it in our community we embrace if I find

165
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:05,689
you drop the each word how to find a

166
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:08,930

172
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:32,660
idea is this we have narratives we have

173
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:35,599
imperfect shortcuts we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about they</font>

180
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:56,089
boil that down why because it's really

181
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:57,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard to have all the facts in your head</font>

00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:20,030
our interpretation of those facts we

188
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:24,079
boil with them into a narrative we will

206
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:13,880
interpretation of new facts is affected

207
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:16,730
by the pre our previous beliefs some of

208
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,860
you think I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> punching this</font>

even in there why even if they're wrong

640
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:14,379

your car show your stuff and break your

764

as a risk you may accept that we may

00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:14,460
these are the boxes I'm allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hit</font>

1018
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:18,000
these the methods i'm going to have and

1019
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:20,670
that kickoff meeting where you explain

if I see something that is crucial<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1021
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:24,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">right not over something that is kind of</font>

1024
00:55:27,089 --> 00:55:34,828

<font color="#E5E5E5">nations they're still going to recognize</font>

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were covered by some kind of</font>

1028
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:48,270
permission now of course that gets

1029
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:51,059
weirder if the further you are from that

1030
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:52,920
that model of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have been retained by</font>

the owner of the system that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I grant</font>

1032
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:59,430
permission like the keys i'm thinking of

1033
00:55:55,140 --> 00:56:03,180
is a friend in the morning of mine once

1034
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:05,040
am bum who basically Google boards for a

1035
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:08,430
US this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the kind of malware that</font>

1036
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:10,259
would offer up SED it was like is it for

1037
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:14,069
something I'd spacing on what it was but

1038
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:16,049
he googled work for it and found insults

1039
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:17,130
across the United States and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what he</font>

1040
00:56:16,049 --> 00:56:19,940
would do is he would then figure out

1041
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:23,000
where this box was

1042
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:25,430
who owned it and call them up and say

1043
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:29,660
look your system got on Mother's piece

1044
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:33,049
of malware and offering a is offering a

1045
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:36,200
non-event TV of whatever's on that locks

1046
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:38,720
and the case he ran<font color="#CCCCCC"> into was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

1047
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:42,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">that a health system in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Louisiana and</font>

1048
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:45,140
their response<font color="#E5E5E5"> was not the Oneg shelling</font>

1049
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:46,610
us as awesome instead it was why did you

1050
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:51,529
hack her systems and he's trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1051
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:54,860
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I didn't I decide and it took a</font>

1052
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:57,650
few iterations get to these I saw your

1053
00:56:54,860 --> 00:57:00,800
door open an<font color="#CCCCCC"> analogy work for you I</font>

1054
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:03,920
poked<font color="#CCCCCC"> my head in to see whose house it</font>

1055
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:06,380
was but I didn't get your door<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I</font>

1056
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:10,550
didn't get your stuff it was like that

1057
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:11,810
when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> got here going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back to liability</font>

1058
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:15,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">though except</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reals have completely</font>

1059
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:18,470
missed the question um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

1060
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:21,440
it going back it's a question of what

1061
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:25,160
were you doing and wiring doing it and

1062
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:28,220
courts may find that the very structured

1063
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:30,710
I'm a pen tester working for you is

1064
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:36,740
different and what Sam did which is work

1065
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:46,040
if and say what we have to come for one

1066
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:49,879
more question I'm not 400 pounds yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1067
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:53,060
think the other one was irrelevant in

1068
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:55,850
this question cyber is important right

1069
00:57:53,060 --> 00:58:01,490
like Oliver commerce was done that way

1070
00:57:55,850 --> 00:58:04,430
we're in the news he will see different

1071
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:06,290
things and then click anyone had but

1072
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:13,040
either way much it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go up</font>

1073
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:16,270
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get more focus I think</font>

1074
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:19,340
we're good thanks so much

1075
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:24,080
[Applause]

1076
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:27,440
you can't figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to turn off</font>

1077
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:30,650
with blank videssians<font color="#CCCCCC"> no garage maybe I</font>

1078
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:33,790
just couple quick announcement our next

1079
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:33,790
