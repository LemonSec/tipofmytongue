1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,960
can everybody hear me<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah too loud</font>

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:14,490
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you luck ok ok so today I'm going</font>

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,859
to talk a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about the</font>

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:21,448
technological advances and forensic

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:23,910
challenges of situations that are coming

6
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">up for us as forensic examiners so it's</font>

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,948
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to be a real</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> low-level you</font>

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,910
know here's how you do this because when

9
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,679
we talk about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,670
technological advances that we have

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,920
coming up we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have all a</font>

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:42,059
level way to go through and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do some of</font>

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:46,829
these challenges so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go over</font>

14
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:48,989
a lot of basic procedures I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

15
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,469
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about me only for 30</font>

16
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,120
seconds some of you already know me I'm

17
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,370
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little do a brief</font>

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,739
overview of the technological advances

19
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,839
that we have coming up I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

20
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,378
cover some legislative and regulatory

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,409
updates some of the items that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

22
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:10,020
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the news in the last week or so and</font>

23
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,810
then some tools and methods that are

24
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,390
available for forensic acquisitions for

25
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,850
some of the technologies that we're

26
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,780
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run into or that word that</font>

27
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:25,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're currently developing so I teach</font>

28
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,540
here at Bloomsburg University I have my

assessment that kind of thing I besides

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,630
have on my PhD<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a ton of industry</font>

36
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,990
for quite a while when<font color="#CCCCCC"> they first came</font>

37
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,740
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the cloud forensic challenges a</font>

38
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:57,060
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nuh said it are</font>

39
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:59,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful but sometimes the</font>

40
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,700
way that they put things together we end

41
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,408
up with architectures that may be hard

42
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">to implement in some of our environment</font>

43
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:10,379
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do provide very good reference</font>

material for processes and procedures

00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:14,730
and things like that

46
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,490
I'm also the president of the digital

00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:20,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">forensic certification board we are a</font>

00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:24,600
group of forensic practitioners who have

00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:27,390
two certifications 14 associate which is

at least five years worth of experience

55
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,390
and it's a vendor-neutral certification

56
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:47,609
so we don't you know we don't rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

57
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:51,690
any type of product or technology so

58
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,760
here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is your case you're</font>

59
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:57,840
working on the case where the court is

60
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:03,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to decide whether or not a suspect</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture the suspect said he's not</font>

64
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:20,850
guilty because malware was found

65
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:23,310
pre-installed on dozens of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dozen of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">android phones and he happens to have a</font>

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,660
phone that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> produced by one of those</font>

68
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,330
manufacturers so his phone already came

69
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,239
with malware on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in addition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to that</font>

70
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:35,790
hackers can use a<font color="#CCCCCC"> five dollar speaker to</font>

71
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,480
control this<font color="#E5E5E5"> smartphone into Fitbit</font>

72
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:42,810
using sound waves so in addition to his

73
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:47,790
phone being infected hackers<font color="#CCCCCC"> use sound</font>

74
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:51,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">waves to access his phone and send a</font>

00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:08,370
suspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really guilty we're going to</font>

79
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,730
use artificial intelligence mind-reading

<font color="#E5E5E5">technology to tell whether the crime was</font>

81
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,529
premeditated or not so we're going to

82
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,850
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> AI to hook up some electrodes to his</font>

head to figure out whether it was

84
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,160
premeditated or not so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the case</font>

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,190
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to work on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when you</font>

89
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay what about what about the suspect</font>

90
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">theory that malware and hackers were the</font>

92
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:57,950
searches phone okay all right but these

93
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:01,070
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that you're going</font>

94
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:02,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be facing as you move forward in the</font>

95
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,840
world I mean these all these topics

96
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:09,770
right here all the all these blocks that

97
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:13,820
i have here came out of news bits in the

98
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:15,740
last couple weeks so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

99
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,120
little bit about technological advance

100
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,830
it's mostly the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet of Things</font>

101
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">because that's the big thing that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

102
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,640
big buzz<font color="#E5E5E5"> word these days internet of</font>

103
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:25,550
things I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit</font>

104
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:28,010
about big data and how big data affects

105
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:30,620
the way that we do forensics because

106
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:32,210
there is no more push to find the

107
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,620
evidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> buttons because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have too</font>

108
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:36,200
much data and we can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that anymore</font>

109
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,550
and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last thing I'm going to do</font>

110
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,979
is I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about</font>

111
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,540
security especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> because some of the</font>

112
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:47,720
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have hit the news recently</font>

113
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:51,170
and how well we are doing security wise

114
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:54,590
on protecting our resources that we have

115
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:58,730
out there and why you will all have jobs

116
00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:00,320
for the foreseeable future so the

117
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:03,410
Internet of Things what is the Internet

118
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:09,890
of Things the Internet of Things is any

119
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:14,360
device any time any place any path any

120
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:15,800
business from anybody so basically and I

121
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,080
have a slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> in here from Bruce Schneier</font>

122
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,510
who he said basically what we've done

123
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,630
with the Internet of Things is that

124
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:26,780
we've actually created a worldwide robot

125
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:28,790
we've taken everything and we've hooked

126
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:33,739
everything together worldwide we've

127
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:35,660
created one big giant robot so when we

128
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,870
look at implementations for internet of

129
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,409
things we look at vehicle through our

130
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,050
vehicles

131
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:44,419
a big thing I know some of you that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

132
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:48,860
students here have gone or will be going

133
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:51,979
to the cyber<font color="#E5E5E5"> auto challenge that's held</font>

134
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:55,069
in Michigan in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> summertime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where they</font>

135
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:58,519
look at vehicle hacking pet monitoring

agriculture automation agriculture

137

farmers<font color="#E5E5E5"> now are using devices to monitor</font>

139

their crops to monitor their fields

140
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:14,059
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that there was an article</font>

141
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:17,599
not too long ago about even about the

142
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:20,029
tractors about how a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them are</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">having some issues because John Deere</font>

144
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:25,099
wouldn't let them alter the the

145
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,689
information in their tractors and they

00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,270
was the other thing too is we have you

188
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,310
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine to machine and wireless</font>

189
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,740
sensor networks now so i'll even our

190
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,390
wireless network for changing so we have

191
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,070
a lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do</font>

about you in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pedophiles and stuff in</font>

00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">those children are so we have a lot of</font>

00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,390
those a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those kind of things</font>

207
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,970
smart phones smart cities that's a lot

208
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:53,910
of what a lot of what's been coming and

209
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,440
telemedicine and<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care I'm going</font>

210
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to touch on that a little bit but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font>

211
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,530
whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have done secure the</font>

212
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:04,020
assessments on medical facilities and

213
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:08,069
I'm really not sure exactly what we're

214
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:11,100
going to do with healthcare and medicine

215
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:13,290
simply because<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of the devices that</font>

216
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">are used in the medical industry are old</font>

217
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,240
and they're built on old technology and

218
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,280
you can't do penetration tests on them

219
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,190
because if you do you'll break them you

220
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,810
can kill<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> operate the</font>

221
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">machine that they're hooked up to and</font>

222
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:30,329
then on the flip side of that right

223
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:32,580
there was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big article about how when</font>

224
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,830
we had somebody who was going to hack

225
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,600
Dick Cheney's pacemaker I via that

226
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,520
article about Dick Cheney's pacemaker

227
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,680
could be had you know and recently there

228
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:44,100
was an article that came out where there

229
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,630
was a memo put out to the medical

230
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,490
community to be careful about the

231
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:49,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">technologies that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they use but one of</font>

232
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">the things about the medical facility</font>

233
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:54,930
that is a little bit I guess unnerving

234
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,910
to me is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times when I walk</font>

235
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:00,420
into facilities you have a lot of a lot

236
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:03,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">of work stations that are unsecured</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

237
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:06,250
in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that now you have all</font>

238
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,750
your doctors want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to use</font>

239
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:11,380
tablets<font color="#E5E5E5"> and their phones and they want</font>

240
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:13,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be able to connect wirelessly and if</font>

241
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,430
those facilities aren't secured you have

242
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,260
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> patients data that's going out</font>

243
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,849
there and even though even though

244
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,069
they're subject to regulation like HIPAA

245
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:25,240
that doesn't that doesn't preclude

246
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:26,860
anything from happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did as an</font>

247
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,630
assessment on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> medical facility that</font>

248
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,510
was hacked twice not once but twice they

249
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:33,490
were hacked one and then they they they

250
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,540
had an assessment done and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

251
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,980
I am we don't want to spend the money

252
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of fix it what do you</font>

253
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,070
think a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> months later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they got</font>

254
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,570
hacked again and then at that point they

255
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,520
were really really really in deep

256
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:45,490
trouble and so they had to have somebody

257
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:50,590
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and look at what they were</font>

people that want to monitor was because

<font color="#E5E5E5">people who ask forcibly would install</font>

00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:26,029
spyware on there's fight on their

382
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:27,829
spouses phone so they could track what

383
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:29,720
they were doing and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

384
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:34,160
even you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know even out there was a case</font>

385
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:36,589
not too long ago too aware a cell phone

386
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,660
a gentleman was accused of unless really

387
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:43,639
actually was in the local paper where he

388
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:48,050
was accused of trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to monitor his ex</font>

389
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:51,860
by putting a GPS application on her

390
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:53,599
phone and he there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PSA order</font>

391
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,399
already against him and so he probably

392
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,709
he shouldn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

393
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,209
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that looking</font>

394
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:00,829
at looking at what happened I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

395
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:04,668
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he knew what he was doing</font>

396
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:07,668
because number one the device that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

397
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:09,799
bought would didn't work that way and so

398
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:11,959
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he probably wasted as money</font>

399
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:13,609
and got in more trouble but you know

400
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:15,860
that's the way it goes but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're home</font>

401
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:17,418
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> your home appliance appliance</font>

402
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:19,129
control that's one of the things to

403
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:20,480
write how many of you control you can

404
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,429
control your heat from somewhere else

405
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,149
right you can't roll you control the

406
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:40,039
heat turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rubbing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on right yeah and</font>

410
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,210
actually through the web because you

411
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,408
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do it for your phone</font>

412
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,000
most of the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that that</font>

413
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:51,830
happens is you connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> an application</font>

414
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,690
that then connects to the device right

415
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,799
refrigerators we have a big thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,390
bit about is big data so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

431
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:27,440
data all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> data I have at my house I</font>

432
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:31,700
have a pretty big data there so if that

433
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,529
is that um when you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your hex</font>

434
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:38,659
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it being this place existed</font>

435
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:41,059
for this big data it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is big data do we</font>

436
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:45,559
know what big data is here's a here's an

437
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:47,270
official description or definition of

438
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:50,240
big data and I think I took this from

439
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:52,668
the dictionary com it's a term that

440
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,740
describes the large volume of data both

441
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:56,630
structure and unstructured that

442
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,159
inundates a business on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> day to day</font>

443
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,380
basis and i like the word in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dates</font>

444
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:02,840
because it is we have way way way way

445
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,460
way too much data<font color="#E5E5E5"> i I when I used to go</font>

446
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,418
out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do security assessments one of</font>

447
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,279
the first things we were thought we

448
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:09,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">would talk to all the business units and</font>

449
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,610
we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what kind</font>

450
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,899
of data they're compiling and where

451
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,639
they're getting their data from I mean

452
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:16,370
you have so much data coming in and out

453
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:20,360
of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> business on a day-to-day basis it's</font>

454
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:23,658
unfathomable on a lot of instances so

455
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,639
this basically is a slide to<font color="#CCCCCC"> show the</font>

456
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:28,490
differences between what we consider

457
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:32,149
traditional data and big data and

458
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:34,460
there's and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is important to us</font>

459
00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:39,139
as forensic people because number one

460
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:41,270
traditional data is a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier</font>

461
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:44,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">for us to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to pull information</font>

462
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:46,370
from Big Data one of the biggest things

463
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:48,500
is that a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is on structure</font>

464
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,600
right when you have a lot of

465
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,299
unstructured data from a forensic

466
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,879
standpoint mean those of you that those

467
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:57,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">of you that are in the the cell phone</font>

468
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,140
class with me right now you know that

469
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:04,050
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last thing that we did was</font>

470
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,900
damn right when you have so much

471
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:09,480
unstructured data how every one of these

472
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:12,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">applications stores</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> timestamp is</font>

473
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,640
different and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the format's aren't always</font>

474
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,459
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same so you're going to have</font>

475
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:21,270
instances where you may have to

476
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:24,150
interpret five different<font color="#CCCCCC"> timestamps five</font>

477
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:25,980
different ways and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times the</font>

478
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:28,950
tools don't automatically don't

479
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:32,520
automatically change those time stamps

480
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:35,040
for you and cells is a self as a big one

481
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you have a lot of unstructured data</font>

482
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,330
the other thing too is normally in

483
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,370
traditional data you have a you know a

484
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:44,550
centralized database where everything is

485
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:50,580
stored in<font color="#CCCCCC"> big data it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> highly</font>

486
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:54,720
distributed scale-wise traditional data

487
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:57,689
we're talking oh you know terabytes

488
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,250
gigabytes terabytes of data when we get

489
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,920
into massive scale we're talking

490
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,960
petabytes an exabyte and we have a hard

491
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,500
enough time processing terabytes of data

492
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,510
so when we get to look at the way is out

493
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,360
you know how we're going to deal with

494
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:15,180
big data we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to look for</font>

495
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:18,030
patterns in a relationship not so much

496
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,590
pull the information pull the index dot

497
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:21,090
dot and look at what's in there we're

498
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:23,760
going to have to look for patterns and

499
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:28,620
relationships so the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we deal</font>

500
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:30,240
with data relationships as we move more

501
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,969
and more into having to analyze big data

502
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,270
the way that we do forensics is going to

503
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:39,090
change so<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 b's as big</font>

504
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:43,500
data volume that's number<font color="#CCCCCC"> one we have a</font>

505
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:46,439
huge quat quantity of data velocity the

506
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,750
speed paid the speed right if you're

507
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,810
doing network analysis if you're doing a

508
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:55,470
network analysis and you pull log files

509
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:59,010
of something the speed that we're moving

510
00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:01,350
data around that now if you pull the log

511
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,960
files now and then cool to them again

512
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:06,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">five minutes later is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your tropic going</font>

513
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:11,940
to be the same traffic's not going to be

514
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:13,959
the same and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> one point I knew a</font>

515
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,539
gentleman who was<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font>

516
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:20,260
a tag that would be put in with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

517
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:22,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">ISPs that we would be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tag data</font>

518
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,158
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out exactly where it wasn't</font>

519
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,390
where it came from because this feed is

520
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,890
free fast variety data types and that

521
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,450
would that actually came from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

522
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,390
foot is the last slide we have all

523
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:36,279
different types of data and then the

524
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,799
varsity messy it's like really nothing

525
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:41,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know I mean how do you normally when</font>

526
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,210
you do a forensic investigation you you

527
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,980
know you get a case<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it says okay</font>

528
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:48,640
this is what this is what we're looking

529
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:51,970
for so generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scope of what you</font>

530
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:55,720
have to examine if small compared<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

531
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:59,950
what we have in<font color="#E5E5E5"> big data so here's a</font>

532
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:04,029
little bit of some of the challenges in

533
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:06,370
volumes in the big data volume we have

534
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:09,850
laws we have event logs you know you got

535
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:12,699
you got speech recognition social media

536
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:15,490
and that's more of on a traditional

537
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:17,710
level of the velocity<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rate of the</font>

538
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:20,830
analysis to see degeneration the

539
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:22,779
veracity untrusted and unclenched this

540
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,720
is this is one area that's kind of a

541
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:29,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of a problem because if you</font>

542
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,789
have untrusted data then really you have

543
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,220
another problem and that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

544
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:34,510
things that NIST was working on when

545
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,549
they were going through and putting

546
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:38,440
together the rest into architecture how

547
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:41,350
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that the data we get is</font>

548
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,779
trusted data do we know that that's good

549
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:45,699
data so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some of the issues</font>

550
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:49,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that work on that we're going to face</font>

551
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:52,480
when we look at big data so that's your

552
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:54,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">little little overview on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big data the</font>

553
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,169
next thing I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

554
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm just going to touch on security a</font>

555
00:23:56,169 --> 00:24:01,000
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get</font>

556
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:04,960
into some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the more recent things that</font>

557
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,360
have come up now we're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what</font>

558
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">we now we have wireless connections for</font>

559
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,350
machine-to-machine and the Internet of

560
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:15,250
Things so we actually have vendors who

561
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:19,059
have routers and switches for this type

562
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:21,490
of communication number one it's good

563
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:23,918
that those devices are out there and

564
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:27,039
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that they're being</font>

565
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,789
implemented however as forensic people

566
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,499
that

567
00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:31,119
what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that mean to us what does that</font>

568
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:33,789
mean to us whether what do we care about

569
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">this but we have you know we've got</font>

570
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:38,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">wireless we have wireless connections</font>

571
00:24:35,499 --> 00:24:39,369
now and wireless devices that will

572
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:40,809
manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> the connections for</font>

573
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:42,459
machine-to-machine in the internet thing

574
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:44,139
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't care about that anybody who</font>

575
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:51,369
ever to care about how would you care

576
00:24:44,139 --> 00:24:52,178
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the other thing too is do</font>

577
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:53,859
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the method of</font>

578
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:54,999
communication is exactly the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

579
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:57,999
the type of wireless that you're using

580
00:24:54,999 --> 00:25:01,479
out so it's new devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's new type of</font>

581
00:24:57,999 --> 00:25:03,789
data that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to analyze right so</font>

582
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:05,080
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have we have a lot of a lot of other</font>

583
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:06,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">things plus two there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there a lot of</font>

584
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,070
unknowns there are a lot of a note and

585
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:10,269
that's a like from the first slide from

586
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,649
the one the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide said that you</font>

587
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:13,659
know that there were you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there were</font>

588
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:15,459
dozens of Android devices that have you

589
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:17,259
know that it had malware installed on

590
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,210
them when they went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> market a while</font>

591
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:21,099
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were in this is a long time</font>

592
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,389
back some of the cell phones that came

593
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:25,059
on if you look at them they had pictures

594
00:25:22,389 --> 00:25:26,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the workers in the factory that were</font>

595
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:27,489
testing the phones because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

596
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:28,659
testing the phones and they took

597
00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:30,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">pictures of themselves and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

598
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:32,409
left<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the phone and you got your phone</font>

599
00:25:30,249 --> 00:25:34,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you had some pictures</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on your phone</font>

600
00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:36,220
already you know so you're right with

601
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:37,989
these type of devices you don't know do

602
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:40,239
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it is there some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of back</font>

603
00:25:37,989 --> 00:25:42,070
door and there's been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

604
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:43,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that about back doors have been</font>

605
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,979
putting devices you know because a lot

606
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:48,009
of our devices come from foreign

607
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:50,559
countries so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about that and</font>

608
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:57,129
the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> encryption there's a</font>

609
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:59,739
big a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> push for encryption but as we</font>

610
00:25:57,129 --> 00:26:01,899
deal with encryption as forensic people

611
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:03,639
you know it used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be even so I mean</font>

612
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:05,109
cell phone even<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell phone analysis cell</font>

613
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:08,918
phone analysis used to be pretty easy

614
00:26:05,109 --> 00:26:10,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know if you could get the pin or you</font>

615
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:13,720
could figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the swipe on the phone</font>

616
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,809
you pretty much could you know could get

617
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:20,080
get into the device now with a lot of

618
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:21,940
the way that we're doing encryption even

619
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,859
if you do a chip off on the phone you

620
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:26,679
pull that ship<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and you put it</font>

621
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:28,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">through a chip reader all that data was</font>

622
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:31,119
encrypted when that phone was shut down

623
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,739
then all you're going to get all all

624
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,299
that time that you spent doing that chip

625
00:26:32,739 --> 00:26:36,249
off all you're going to get out of it is

626
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:39,730
a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff you can't read so</font>

627
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:41,320
encryption is a big problem for us in in

628
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,269
the forensic world

629
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:47,439
depending on what depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

630
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:50,679
happens with our government we we may be

631
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,750
able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have access to encrypted data</font>

632
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:55,330
however<font color="#CCCCCC"> I there's always going to be</font>

633
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:58,090
that push for for data privacy and

634
00:26:55,330 --> 00:27:02,019
there's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be the push for</font>

635
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:03,549
I said maybe not even host our data here

636
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:06,700
in the United States due to the fact

637
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:08,860
that we've changed the laws so that's

638
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:12,399
just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little overview on security so</font>

639
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:13,779
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is something that that came</font>

640
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:17,139
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this was when I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

641
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:19,360
wireless technologies so here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go this</font>

642
00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:22,240
came out this was februari first of this

643
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,490
year this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> from up there in British</font>

644
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">Columbia sierra wireless they were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

state-of-the-art wireless connectivity

00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:39,789
to the to the bloodhound supersonic car

650
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:42,279
this is a unique car it's going to

651
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:45,250
travel<font color="#E5E5E5"> faster than a bullet it uses the</font>

652
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:47,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">same connected car technology that</font>

00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:49,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sierra Wireless is providing to</font>

654
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:50,950
transform the next generation of

655
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,240
automobiles worldwide so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have it</font>

656
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:57,190
we got the prototype out here for a you

657
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,080
are that will travel faster than<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

658
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:02,830
bullet and we already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have wireless</font>

659
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,418
technology up there for it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it</font>

660
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,610
kind of changes the scope of things so

661
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:09,730
that I like to be able to have a car

662
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:12,309
that travels faster than a bullet but i

663
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:14,470
can't imagine i tend to measure with the

664
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:17,678
what the cost of something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

665
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:19,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be so then that brings me so then</font>

666
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,600
that brings me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our next point which</font>

667
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:24,340
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple right in our iOS devices and i</font>

668
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked a lot about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that because we</font>

669
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:31,389
really don't know what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen</font>

670
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:32,769
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple releases their iphone 8 we do</font>

671
00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:35,860
know that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to come out and</font>

672
00:28:32,769 --> 00:28:39,370
it's said to<font color="#E5E5E5"> release in September of</font>

673
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:43,418
this year but rumor has it that do they

674
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:46,539
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use I were scanning retina</font>

675
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:49,960
scanning they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use biometrics</font>

676
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:54,039
facial<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognition technology in that so</font>

677
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">added 20 so rumor and it came actually</font>

678
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:58,269
because they

679
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:59,978
acquired a NAPA a vendor called real

680
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:01,419
face so we don't really know what's

681
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:02,739
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come out with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apple but you got</font>

682
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:05,109
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about that and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have some</font>

683
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:06,549
slides later on in regard to search

684
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:09,759
warrant language and things like that

685
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:12,580
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean currently currently</font>

686
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:14,200
if we have a device that is used and

687
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,269
most of our most of our devices now use

688
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,399
fingerprint technology right so if you

689
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:20,830
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> device that fingerprint debut you</font>

690
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:23,258
use a fingerprint to unlock and the

691
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">suspect and you don't end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the suspect or</font>

692
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:26,559
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you know you don't know</font>

693
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:28,869
you found<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the foot you</font>

694
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,089
don't have sex or the suspects won't

695
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:33,070
won't agree to give you their phone if

696
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:34,869
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> civil case and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the suspect</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">fingerprint what options do you have if</font>

699
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,418
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into a device in the end</font>

700
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:42,460
the suspect won't give you their

701
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:49,299
fingerprint with your options<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your</font>

702
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:50,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">options okay so okay so that's it you</font>

703
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:52,119
try and find something that they touched

704
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:59,289
and copy their fingerprint how you going

705
00:29:52,119 --> 00:30:00,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">to copy their fingerprints there is a</font>

706
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:03,009
method to do that actually in yeah

707
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:06,099
actually we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with agar agar agar</font>

708
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:08,859
is is is a technology it's kind of like

709
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:10,989
the gummy<font color="#CCCCCC"> bear gel and there's I have a</font>

710
00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:11,949
paper if anybody is<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

711
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:14,469
a paper<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

712
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,879
references where they they took it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

713
00:30:14,469 --> 00:30:25,299
they recreate the fingerprint using

714
00:30:15,879 --> 00:30:27,428
something like that then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know big</font>

715
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:28,929
point and there are like and it depends

716
00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:31,299
on it depends on what it is like in

717
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:34,210
criminal cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in criminal cases</font>

718
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:36,249
there have been known cases where like

719
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:38,769
drug dealers and stuff like that have

720
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:40,929
actually burned off the tips to their

721
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:43,299
fingers so that their fingerprints are

722
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:44,679
unrecognizable so if you have you know

723
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:47,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you have a case like that where</font>

724
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:50,139
somebody actually alters their

725
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:51,609
fingerprint didn't get all the warns you

726
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:53,019
one you get the fingerprint that you get

727
00:30:51,609 --> 00:30:57,309
off me not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to open that device</font>

728
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:58,989
because I've altered my fingerprint is

729
00:30:57,309 --> 00:31:01,269
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means they have to be a</font>

730
00:30:58,989 --> 00:31:02,889
temperature so if you get out you're

731
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:04,690
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop anything they have the</font>

732
00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:08,199
body temperature they do with it that's

733
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:10,570
right that's right and but

734
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,990
it's heated to just the right body

735
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:15,760
temperature and then and then put<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

736
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:17,500
there but you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> right it's true a lot</font>

737
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,289
of them are a lot of them are

738
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:31,000
temperature sensor that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

739
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:35,860
ya know and if it's done by saying that

740
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,690
if it's done by biometrics used to

741
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,299
because you still need them you still

742
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:44,799
need the biometric to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to unlock</font>

743
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:48,490
the device in addition to so you would

744
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:55,149
need the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biometric and the pianist so I</font>

745
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:59,230
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that do that if you</font>

746
00:31:55,149 --> 00:32:02,500
read it<font color="#CCCCCC"> like my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> daughter or my wife to</font>

747
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:04,870
Michael I provide them with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 pitch</font>

748
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,490
because you get up so we did with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

749
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:10,899
fingerprint and then it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't work</font>

750
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:12,399
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can come back in the option and</font>

751
00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:14,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think that long right when you but you</font>

752
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:17,739
turned that on its not<font color="#E5E5E5"> on automatically</font>

753
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:20,019
right so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so there's the answer</font>

754
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:22,630
that if that if the phone is set up that

755
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:25,419
way yes but generally speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> unless</font>

756
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and left that is activated you're</font>

757
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:30,549
not going to be able to get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

758
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:32,350
without both pieces alright so that's a

759
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:36,309
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what's coming up with</font>

760
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:38,769
our um our security so here are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

761
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:40,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that happen in the last and then</font>

762
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:41,950
and these actually a lot of these came

763
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:44,918
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last few the last few days</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">happening out there and you know a lot</font>

00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:43,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">of times I present and we talk a whole</font>

786
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,730
lot about regulation and compliant and

787
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:48,279
compliance and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't we have</font>

788
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:51,549
regulations we have regulations we have

789
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:55,419
compliance but from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that perspective and</font>

790
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:59,769
my take on the whole thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if if</font>

791
00:33:55,419 --> 00:34:04,179
you're compliant does that mean you're

792
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:05,649
secure absolutely not and so that's one

793
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:08,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the problem is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

794
00:34:05,649 --> 00:34:10,060
have is that we've placed so much on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

795
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:11,589
fact that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know oh yeah you know</font>

796
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,719
we're following the reg we check the

797
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:15,429
boxes we're compliant but were you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

798
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:17,828
you may be compliant based on the

799
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:19,270
regulations but you're not secure and I

800
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:21,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know that there's and there's no</font>

801
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:23,290
such thing as call security really there

802
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,810
is not but some of these things like

803
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:27,849
this this was an undocumented feature in

804
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">Windows biennium and it comes all the</font>

805
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:30,940
way up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows 10 which one of the</font>

806
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:34,030
things should tell us a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot about</font>

807
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:36,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">our operating</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> system vendors right that</font>

808
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:39,010
we you that we reuse the same coat over

809
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:41,079
and over and over and over again there's

810
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:44,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably still cold from like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows 31</font>

811
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:47,200
in there somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> but and so we you</font>

812
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:50,260
know we have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this stuff and one</font>

813
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:54,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that I that I have</font>

814
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:56,829
here last it's about and just because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

815
00:34:54,129 --> 00:34:58,839
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird sense of humor is that we</font>

816
00:34:56,829 --> 00:35:01,060
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> chinese hackers they're using</font>

817
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:03,190
faith-based transmitted transceiver

818
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:05,170
stations so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what happens when</font>

819
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:08,170
you have cell phone communications the

820
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:09,460
phone communicates to a cell power and

821
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:12,339
then that goes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your mobile base</font>

822
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:14,290
station so they put up these fake these

823
00:35:12,339 --> 00:35:16,509
fake base transceiver stations and

824
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:18,609
they're distributed distributing a

825
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:21,069
swearing corrosion so it's an android

826
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:22,750
banking trojan but the code has<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese</font>

827
00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:24,400
swear words in it so that's how you can

828
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:27,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">identify it by the Chinese swear words</font>

829
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,410
that are in<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and in it says it at once</font>

830
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,940
if they thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was neutralized</font>

831
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:34,089
after its authors were arrested in a

832
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,980
police raid by checkpoint found that

833
00:35:34,089 --> 00:35:36,540
check

834
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,340
found 15 different versions of it out

835
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">there so I don't know I mean I know that</font>

836
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,430
we have a load that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> spending a lot</font>

837
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,970
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money on security but I don't know</font>

838
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:49,049
how well we're implementing it or is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

839
00:35:44,970 --> 00:36:10,230
just that are our hackers are one step

840
00:35:49,050 --> 00:36:15,990
ahead of us fuck yeah they did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

841
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:18,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">the friends indeed it was tuned oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

842
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,500
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah they did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was with somebody</font>

843
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:24,480
from another country yeah that's true

844
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:26,340
sir thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so that's a little</font>

845
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit about security and you know</font>

846
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,550
encryption and where we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going and was</font>

847
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,600
what are some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenges we face</font>

848
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:32,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh the next thing I'm going to talk a</font>

849
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:36,960
little bit it's about legislation

850
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:41,970
legislative changes not so much in in

851
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:43,800
laws that we currently have that aren't

852
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:46,410
implement it properly but things that

853
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:50,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">have come up recently that should give</font>

854
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:54,540
us all pause and wonder what's going on

855
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:56,970
so you all know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that WikiLeaks</font>

856
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:59,700
released dark matter right anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

857
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:02,100

858
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:05,189
WikiLeaks has been doing the vault<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7</font>

859
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:07,410
stuff for the last couple weeks they can

860
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:10,470
it contains documentation for several

861
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:12,600
CIA projects that<font color="#CCCCCC"> effect Apple Mac</font>

862
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:14,339
firmware and one of the things we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

863
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:18,600
a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot about when we talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Max</font>

864
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:21,420
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple is that you know we've had a</font>

865
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:25,259
lot of cases where even though the

866
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:28,530
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> has the technology to hack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

867
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:31,800
crack a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the security on devices</font>

868
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:34,920
they have chosen to lose cases as

869
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:38,640
opposed to actually divulging how their

870
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:41,550
methods are are performed and so as a

871
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,770
result I think set a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

872
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:47,130
stuff that's coming out on Wikileaks as

873
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:48,538
a result of that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the scary</font>

874
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:51,359
thing is about it it says

875
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:55,049
it's that it's persistent on your Apple

876
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:57,869
devices so which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's its</font>

877
00:37:55,049 --> 00:38:00,329
firmware malware it's not anything that

878
00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:02,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can put the device box to a factory</font>

879
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:08,249
reset and it works because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's firm or</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">embed it this one I like Adama not</font>

881
00:38:08,249 --> 00:38:12,509
really thrilled about this or<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talk a</font>

882
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:15,209
little bit about the iron<font color="#E5E5E5"> tea and stuff</font>

883
00:38:12,509 --> 00:38:17,429
with this but our<font color="#E5E5E5"> Senate voted to let</font>

ISP sell your web browsing history of

885
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:24,929
advertisers so the thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> now our isp</font>

886
00:38:22,499 --> 00:38:28,410
stands for invading subscriber privacy

00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:29,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">and basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eliminates broadband</font>

00:38:39,089 --> 00:38:42,390
said now you know we don't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> care</font>

894
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:43,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">we don't care we don't we don't care</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">about your information we're going to</font>

896
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,339
let advertisers because that's money

897
00:38:44,939 --> 00:38:50,549
that's money right that's money that

898
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:52,349
they can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> off your off your data so</font>

899
00:38:50,549 --> 00:38:54,239
we don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so what does</font>

00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:55,890
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> do what does that do to the what</font>

901
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:57,539
what does what does that question what

902
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:59,219
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that cause your average your</font>

904
00:38:59,219 --> 00:39:01,699
exactly

905
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,920
it does and there were a couple things

906
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,630
there were a couple things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to</font>

907
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,700
mind for me number one number one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

908
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:25,370
ISPs don't retain data for a long period

909
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:28,040
of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unless on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left it</font>

910
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:30,230
there something specific in the way that

911
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,390
advertise that advertisers are going to

912
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,490
request this information all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ifc</font>

913
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:36,680
have to say is<font color="#CCCCCC"> we only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hold that data</font>

914
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:38,509
first you know 48 hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> has gone we</font>

915
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,100
can't give it to you you know they would

916
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:42,260
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> they would have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font>

917
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,790
today's data or I want yesterday's data

918
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,770
so they request would have to be pretty

919
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:47,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific because they use they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

920
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:50,240
retain data for a long period of time

921
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:51,830
and how they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> go about I mean how</font>

922
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,100
they would what they would do with this

923
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:56,509
is beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> me but it's you know it's a</font>

924
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,339
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit scary for me and that's i'm</font>

925
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,690
going to show i want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that i</font>

926
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,160
get through a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this because i know</font>

927
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:05,360
i'm the only thing standing between you

928
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:06,859
and lunch so i will not go over but i do

929
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:26,930
but i do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sure that we get</font>

930
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:42,140
through a thing yes yeah but that's like

931
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:44,270
a scary thing it is yes sir okay so okay

932
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:46,370
so that brings up a good point so if the

933
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:48,860
advertisers are going to pay the ISPs

934
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:50,810
for this information then the ISPs have

935
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:52,640
a financial<font color="#CCCCCC"> motive to say yeah ok we're</font>

936
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:55,490
going to retain it right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's a</font>

937
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,960
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> point very good point alright so</font>

938
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:59,089
the next thing is our recipe on my

939
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,610
director our recently floated an

940
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:03,860
international framework on access to

941
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:05,480
encrypted data and this is from<font color="#E5E5E5"> James</font>

942
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:07,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">Comey needs that I could imagine a</font>

943
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:10,400
community of nations committed to the

944
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:12,920
rule of law developing a set of norms a

945
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,910
framework for when government apps

946
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:18,650
access is appropriate so basically what

947
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:20,899
this means is that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

948
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:22,820
develop a framework to basically put a

949
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,260
backdoor an encryption so that we have

950
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:27,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to whatever it is that we need</font>

951
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:29,400
and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this stems from the fact</font>

952
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,640
that the FBI has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been trying to unlock</font>

953
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">2,800 electronic devices collective</font>

954
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:37,170
agents and local police and<font color="#CCCCCC"> criminal</font>

955
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:39,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">investigations and they had failed to</font>

956
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">open over forty three percent of them</font>

957
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:46,080
even with even with their covert

958
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:49,290
techniques so at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point at this</font>

959
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:50,640
point the only way to get some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

960
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:54,779
information that the government is

961
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:57,120
looking to get to solve cases is to do

962
00:41:54,780 --> 00:42:02,130
back doors so we're looking at floating

963
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:04,890
that around for those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that had me</font>

964
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:08,400
in class no<font color="#E5E5E5"> no that the first one we</font>

965
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:11,250
we've had quite a large discussion on is

966
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,980
you know recently we had a NASA

967
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:16,380
scientist or his work phone was seized

968
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,300
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the airport he came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in I don't know</font>

969
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,570
based on the way he<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked you know I</font>

970
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:23,280
said well or Border Patrol said no we

971
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:25,050
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> phone and we need the</font>

972
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,790
pin that would depend on it if he

973
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:28,950
refused the pin they weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

974
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:30,960
allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> him entry to the country so he</font>

975
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:33,029
gave him the pin the image his phone and

976
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,850
then they imaged his phone they gave it

977
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:37,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to him and they let him go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

978
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:39,600
when I worked for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kroll i traveled a</font>

979
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:41,430
whole lot this would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big problem</font>

980
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:44,910
for me this would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big problem for</font>

981
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:46,290
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know not being able to get back</font>

982
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:49,649
into my own<font color="#CCCCCC"> country because i don't want</font>

983
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:51,990
to supply the pin for my phone or and

984
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:54,660
and and what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this actually</font>

985
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:56,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">is this ditch gentleman's employer</font>

986
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,100
actually took his phone when he<font color="#E5E5E5"> got back</font>

987
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,810
to work they gave him a new phone and

988
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,640
they took<font color="#E5E5E5"> his phone and they're doing</font>

989
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:04,020
forensics on it to see what happened to

990
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,819
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would use you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what and what</font>

991
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,410
happened while he was while they had

992
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,760
that phone because you know no you know

993
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:10,740
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seize your phone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

994
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">they they say the image it and they give</font>

995
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,890
it back to what you know do you know

996
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:17,340
what they put<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it you don't know right</font>

997
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:19,290
so that's a big the other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

998
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:21,600
CNN is reporting that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> White House</font>

999
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:24,720
may be taken tentative steps to explore

1000
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:27,569
what it would take to scan social media

1001
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:30,569
accounts and cell phone accounts of all

1002
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:33,960
visitors to the United States making

1003
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:36,360
social media screening a part of the

1004
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,490
process to enter the country<font color="#E5E5E5"> China the</font>

1005
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:40,590
key word on this is visitors so

1006
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:42,660
it probably wouldn't it wouldn't affect

1007
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:44,040
us that much but<font color="#CCCCCC"> even at that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean</font>

1008
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,540
what if you know what if you had family

1009
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,340
from another country that<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to come</font>

1010
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,450
visit<font color="#CCCCCC"> and our government says you know</font>

1011
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:50,970
if you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into our country</font>

1012
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:52,950
you've got hold of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all</font>

1013
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:54,509
your social media accounts in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell</font>

1014
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:59,250
phone contacts before we let you<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

1015
00:43:54,510 --> 00:44:02,369
the country really<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know so</font>

1016
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:04,080
search warrant language and this kid

1017
00:44:02,369 --> 00:44:05,940
brings me to the search warrant language

1018
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,340
for fingerprints and stuff like that i

1019
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,200
actually have search warrant language

1020
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:12,300
for that type of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have search</font>

1021
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,689
warrant language for cloud acquisitions

1022
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:18,420
and all of that the fingerprint the

1023
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:20,850
fingerprint tends to be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

1024
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:24,119
problematic and that stems from this

1025
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:26,400
last one here the last point which was

1026
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:28,050
an expert or outraged by warrant

1027
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,030
demanding fingerprints to<font color="#CCCCCC"> unlock of</font>

1028
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:32,880
smartphone and what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this</font>

1029
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:36,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">case was this was it was a child</font>

1030
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,790
pornography case and agents went to

1031
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:40,920
everybody in an apartment building<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

1032
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:42,180
had a cell phone that had child porn on

1033
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,040
and they weren't really sure who it

1034
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,660
belonged to so they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a building</font>

1035
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,279
and they said everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buildings</font>

1036
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:50,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">could put your finger on this phone and</font>

1037
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,740
see if it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> unlock it and then and</font>

1038
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,240
and so what happened is that Justin

1039
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:56,879
bothers like no you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't do this we you</font>

1040
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,770
can't I mean it's one thing to do a

1041
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,750
search warrant and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say okay we need your</font>

1042
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:02,520
fingerprint but it's another thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

1043
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:04,470
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole building and just be asking</font>

1044
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,150
people to be putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> their finger on the</font>

1045
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:06,930
phone to see if it unlocks it to trying

1046
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:08,970
to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out who the child</font>

1047
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:11,580
pornographers they had had no right or

1048
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:13,529
no basis to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was that was</font>

1049
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:18,060
something that came out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

1050
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:21,540
this one the 500 fingerprint print clone

1051
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:24,150
unlock murder victim<font color="#CCCCCC"> Samsung</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s6 this is</font>

1052
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:26,100
the research paper i have on how the

1053
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:28,650
fingerprint clone was actually done that

1054
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:31,410
unlocked a phone so for rent of wise we

1055
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:35,250
do have some recourse when we can't

1056
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:36,990
unlock a phone with the fingerprint we

1057
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:39,930
have some methodologies out there that

1058
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:42,330
will allow us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that so what does</font>

1059
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:45,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what do what this really is is that</font>

1060
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:48,210
now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

1061
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:50,340
private citizens using something like

1062
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:52,050
the CI your keys anybody ever seen one

1063
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these are used one of these yeah I</font>

1064
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,860
have

1065
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:57,100
actually I have a plugged into my<font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop</font>

1066
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:58,720
right now i have i've had an iron key

1067
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:01,240
for a long long long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've had it</font>

1068
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,310
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> many many years but yeah and the</font>

1069
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:06,490
ironkey basically how the iron key works

1070
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:08,080
is iron key has its own tour so for

1071
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:10,689
those of you that want for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those of you</font>

1072
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:14,410
that want to keep your traffic from

1073
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:16,540
being intercepted or deciphered and set

1074
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:17,920
up a home tour network you're a whole

1075
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,720
lot your whole lot better off just

1076
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,920
buying a divisive always I got tour on

1077
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:23,470
it because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have to worry about</font>

1078
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:25,690
it and all the tour goes through int so

1079
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:26,919
int has their own tour and that's

1080
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing too that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font>

1081
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,620
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through and doing</font>

1082
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:31,840
investigations probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> with what you're</font>

1083
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find now is you're</font>

1084
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,830
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a lot of tour and the</font>

1085
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:38,170
dolly and things like that on people

1086
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:40,240
systems that not necessarily we're used

1087
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:41,740
for bad things but they were used

1088
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,290
because people wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect their</font>

1089
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:46,720
privacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's one of the things</font>

1090
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:49,960
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> consider thing too is</font>

1091
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:52,600
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I tell examiner's all the</font>

1092
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:54,250
time is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> iron keys were marketed</font>

1093
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:57,100
neither really<font color="#E5E5E5"> means for military and</font>

1094
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:58,870
police forces so you know when you do a

1095
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,549
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these examinations when you find</font>

1096
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:02,830
tour on the dial you don't automatically

1097
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:04,390
assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that something bad</font>

1098
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:07,120
was happening because a lot of this has

1099
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:11,890
to do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> protected information not so</font>

1100
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:13,450
much not so much crimes and I have a

1101
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:15,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">plug-in either plugged into my laptop</font>

1102
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:17,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I know it's getting close to time</font>

1103
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,370
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got about 12 minutes left and I</font>

1104
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,080
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave a few minutes for</font>

1105
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:21,940
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you want to see what it</font>

1106
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,319
looks like let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me know afterwards I'll</font>

1107
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,850
show you so I've got it plugged in you

1108
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,250
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring it up it's a little it's all</font>

1109
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:29,500
it's all self-contained it has portable

1110
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:31,330
applications on it so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks</font>

1111
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,830
just like a like a regular windows just

1112
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:36,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">saw the kind of browser on instead of</font>

1113
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:38,410
just use firefox so for me if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1114
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:42,160
do safe browsing I just plug it in and

1115
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:44,890
it has a piece on there for encrypted

1116
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:47,049
files where does it show me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just it</font>

1117
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:49,359
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> show where where you have a</font>

1118
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:51,850
space on there too to keep encrypted

1119
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:55,060
files as well so you know you may find a

1120
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:56,770
lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that out there so this is</font>

1121
00:47:55,060 --> 00:48:01,240
these are some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things remember I</font>

1122
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:03,670
talked earlier about this about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1123
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,740
gift being considered a deadly weapon

1124
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:06,840
but one

1125
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:08,939
this is is that it has implications for

1126
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,160
roughly 10,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> people with</font>

1127
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:14,130
photosensitive epilepsy in the United

1128
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:16,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">States so what happens if legislature</font>

1129
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:19,680
says well it or the court says it's not

1130
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:23,250
really a deadly weapon and then somebody

1131
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:25,259
receives an image that that has epilepsy

1132
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:28,230
and it causes them to have a seizure and

1133
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:29,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">die then what happens so you know I mean</font>

1134
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:31,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">often you know when we think about the</font>

1135
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:33,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">cause of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> death a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of times we think</font>

1136
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:35,610
about physical physical stuff you know

1137
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:36,869
shooting stabbing things like that but

1138
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:38,130
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is the point where we're</font>

1139
00:48:36,869 --> 00:48:40,230
looking at you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we're kind of</font>

1140
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:41,700
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on technology</font>

1141
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:44,190
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> do we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology to</font>

1142
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,540
actually tell people you know with this

1143
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:48,600
stuff so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what the stuff</font>

1144
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:50,430
that we sent now this other ones who I

1145
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,100
thought was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting is we</font>

1146
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:57,210
have a US appeals judge ruled that

1147
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:59,040
claiming that you cannot remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1148
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:01,320
passphrase to unlock your data is

1149
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,540
willful defiance so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forgot my</font>

1150
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:06,750
decryption password is contempt of court

1151
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:08,610
so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least we got that you know at</font>

1152
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:10,470
least we got that out of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you</font>

1153
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:12,150
say you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember your description</font>

1154
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:16,830
your decrypt your password it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1155
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:18,330
contempt of court so sensors and this

1156
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:20,040
actually is true<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cheniere this was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

1157
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:22,560
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that through to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">send through sensors for IOT we're</font>

1159
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:27,720
giving the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet eyes and ears we're</font>

1160
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:29,670
giving it hands and feet and we're

1161
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">giving it a brain so we're creating an</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">internet that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> census thinks and acts</font>

1163
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:35,940
this is the classic definition of a

1164
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:38,819
robot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I contend that we're building</font>

1165
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:42,030
a world sighs a robot without even

1166
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:46,200
realizing it so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we're at</font>

1167
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:50,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">why traditional forensics won't work we</font>

1168
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:52,919
can't see servers we are now going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

1169
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:56,040
more dependent on providers to acquire

1170
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,960
evidence people collecting the data for

1171
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,820
us may not even be qualified to do that

1172
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:03,330
forensic acquisitions have as a whole

1173
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:04,740
lot cloud you know in IOT<font color="#E5E5E5"> and clouds a</font>

1174
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:06,690
lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is held in the cloud so</font>

1175
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:09,270
it's kind of its kind of interconnected

1176
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:11,010
I do a lot of stuff on cloud but you

1177
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:12,900
know that the data collection may not

1178
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:15,840
even be done by somebody who's qualified

1179
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:18,779
and you don't know the location or the

1180
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:21,299
state of the physical data so on

1181
00:50:18,779 --> 00:50:23,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">h2 a whole lot so the challenges that we</font>

1182
00:50:21,299 --> 00:50:26,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">face</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a lot of these a lot of these</font>

1183
00:50:23,549 --> 00:50:28,349
technological changes are complexity we

1184
00:50:26,549 --> 00:50:30,929
have not there's not a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

1185
00:50:28,349 --> 00:50:33,239
standards or our certification there

1186
00:50:30,929 --> 00:50:35,400
what do we do about<font color="#E5E5E5"> records management</font>

1187
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:38,729
how are the records being<font color="#E5E5E5"> mannish what</font>

1188
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:40,650
format are they in how longer records

1189
00:50:38,729 --> 00:50:42,868
retain especially when you're talking

1190
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:45,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">about ISPs a lot of times ISPs don't</font>

1191
00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:46,949
retain records for a long time so what

1192
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:51,089
happens if we implement something like

1193
00:50:46,949 --> 00:50:55,349
that the technology where an advertiser

1194
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:58,140
is going to pay an ISP for for that data

1195
00:50:55,349 --> 00:51:00,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then you then you do you do a search</font>

1196
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:02,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">for non the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isp d</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peace as I no</font>

1197
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:04,169
longer have the data so then what you go

1198
00:51:02,069 --> 00:51:05,369
the appetizers you subpoena you know

1199
00:51:04,169 --> 00:51:07,348
Senate's which point to the advertiser

1200
00:51:05,369 --> 00:51:09,479
and say okay well the advertisers are

1201
00:51:07,349 --> 00:51:11,009
analyzing this data so logically<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

1202
00:51:09,479 --> 00:51:13,169
think about it the animal the

1203
00:51:11,009 --> 00:51:16,829
advertisers probably have a longer data

1204
00:51:13,169 --> 00:51:18,959
retention periods in the ISPs you know

1205
00:51:16,829 --> 00:51:20,369
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a thing you know you need</font>

1206
00:51:18,959 --> 00:51:23,819
to work on a case you got to go to an

1207
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:27,269
appetizer to get somebody's data I don't

1208
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:28,979
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pretty scary to me and the</font>

1209
00:51:27,269 --> 00:51:31,140
other thing too is we don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

1210
00:51:28,979 --> 00:51:32,788
<font color="#CCCCCC">which service providers are doing it and</font>

1211
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:35,129
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how they you know how they</font>

1212
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:36,839
monitor for compliance and that's a big

1213
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:38,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know me know if we print</font>

1214
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:39,869
a lot of these IOT things out there we

1215
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,009
have there's no security on them we

1216
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:44,729
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we don't know where they're</font>

1217
00:51:41,009 --> 00:51:46,829
going what they're doing so and in the

1218
00:51:44,729 --> 00:51:48,569
main problems that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have is that it's</font>

1219
00:51:46,829 --> 00:51:50,189
such a dynamic<font color="#CCCCCC"> in nature</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's such a</font>

1220
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:52,499
dynamic nature that is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

1221
00:51:50,189 --> 00:51:53,908
hard and in forensics a lot of the stuff

1222
00:51:52,499 --> 00:51:55,738
that one of the day that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1223
00:51:53,909 --> 00:51:58,199
static the static stuff is easy to do

1224
00:51:55,739 --> 00:52:00,239
it's the dynamic stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> is hard you know</font>

1225
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:03,089
it when cloud forensics first came out

1226
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:04,559
you know we had a lot of virtualization

1227
00:52:03,089 --> 00:52:07,439
and stuff getting out there and getting

1228
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,659
out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud at vm what's the</font>

1229
00:52:07,439 --> 00:52:11,848
hardest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to do once you got it then</font>

1230
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:15,449
you know the static analysis is easy to

1231
00:52:11,849 --> 00:52:17,519
do so we have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of major technology</font>

1232
00:52:15,449 --> 00:52:20,189
areas which are cloud computing mobile

1233
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:22,738
devices computers tablets there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFID</font>

1234
00:52:20,189 --> 00:52:27,269
so it's all contained so some of the

1235
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:30,449
tools of processes vendor wise a lot of

1236
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:32,100
don't vendors usually develop tools and

1237
00:52:30,449 --> 00:52:34,530
they develop<font color="#CCCCCC"> tools for their own</font>

1238
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:36,509
purposes they develop them to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

1239
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:38,970
give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give themselves the metrics</font>

1240
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:40,740
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to give themselves data about</font>

1241
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:42,480
what's going on and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly</font>

1242
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:45,060
true in the cloud we're in the cloud a

1243
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,890
lot of like if you go to AWS I mean they

1244
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:48,570
have tons<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools in there the days</font>

1245
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:51,060
made for themselves to be able to

1246
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:53,640
monitor what's going on so a lot of

1247
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:58,230
times vendor developed tools are going

1248
00:52:53,640 --> 00:53:00,450
to help us do that research research

1249
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:03,180
particularly an encryption I have a

1250
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:05,460
paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> that somebody recently wrote on</font>

1251
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:07,500
different methods to bypass certain

1252
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:10,110
types of encryption I have that if

1253
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:14,250
you're interested just<font color="#CCCCCC"> let me know and</font>

1254
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:16,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll share it with you and so vendors oh</font>

1255
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:17,220
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready-made service provider trolls</font>

1256
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:18,930
actually that should the business a

1257
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:23,430
different from vendors developments but

1258
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:25,799
our vendors paraben<font color="#CCCCCC"> F response and case</font>

1259
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:27,540
access data our vendors should be out

1260
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,550
there developing tools that will help<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

1261
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:31,500
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times it comes late sometimes</font>

1262
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:35,370
too late but our vendors do try to

1263
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:38,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">develop tools to help us so when we look</font>

1264
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:40,560
at processes forensic processes<font color="#E5E5E5"> fur for</font>

1265
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:44,130
Internet of Things really what we're

1266
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:46,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at is see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you and this is one</font>

1267
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:49,380
approach one approach is to categorize

1268
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:51,720
them into three groups evidence from

1269
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:54,060
smart devices and sensors evidence from

1270
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,649
hardware and software and then evidence

1271
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:58,320
collected from hardware and software

1272
00:53:55,650 --> 00:54:00,090
that are outside the network under

1273
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,590
investigation so you have insight

1274
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:04,680
outside where<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are included in</font>

1275
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:06,930
traditional and then what is outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1276
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:09,149
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one approach is to take that</font>

1277
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:11,910
take that date that evidence and group

1278
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:15,300
it into three groups this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

1279
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:18,720
this is this calls it three zones where

it segregate out the crime scene in the

two internal border and external zone so

1282
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:25,319
you take you and it's a whole thing of

1283
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,879
it you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have them know a whole lot</font>

1284
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,770
more about networks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you used to know</font>

1285
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you've got to know where data is</font>

1286
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:32,820
coming in where it's going out<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got</font>

1294
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:48,990
a little differently so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

do some smart watches not a whole lot we

1304
00:55:05,759 --> 00:55:08,970
got one from I got one from a foreign

won't see it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we had all kind of</font>

00:55:19,259 --> 00:55:24,420
the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do some smart watches and</font>

1312
00:55:23,009 --> 00:55:26,369
things like that and I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're</font>

00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:30,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on the Internet of Things so</font>

1314
00:55:26,369 --> 00:55:32,279
from data acquisition perspective you're

for you and that leaves us how much time

1335
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:36,480
what and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot of demos up there</font>

1336
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:38,039
there's two jeeps they did the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeep</font>

00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:42,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">the jig number one in order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font>

1339
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:44,460
you got all know a whole lot about how a

1340
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:45,839
car system work so it's not your

1343
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:53,069
have it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a very fine-tuned</font>

1344
00:56:50,819 --> 00:56:56,450

1345
00:56:53,069 --> 00:57:00,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">the other second issue that</font>

1346
00:56:56,450 --> 00:57:03,500
I get it he's from Pompeii and the

1347
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:04,940
actually reported that a ton of cell

1348
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:08,750
phone towers out there nobody knew

1349
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:10,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">people well that's true</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know and</font>

1350
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:12,109
that's why I was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the base</font>

1351
00:57:10,339 --> 00:57:13,759
station<font color="#E5E5E5"> transceivers because you don't</font>

1352
00:57:12,109 --> 00:57:15,470
know you don't know who puts them up I

1353
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,030
mean they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could I mean normally that</font>

1354
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:18,140
stuff is monitored I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1355
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:20,599
supposed to be monitor but like by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1356
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:22,520
FCC but yeah but you don't detest the

1357
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:24,680
FCC really know when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> put towers</font>

1358
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,000
up unless they request a license or

1359
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,649
something like that I mean you could

1360
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,180
probably put up a tower and I mean how

1361
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:30,650
long would it take them so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

1362
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:32,359
out till somebody had an incident<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1363
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:35,450
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> reported it a lot of times it's</font>

1364
00:57:32,359 --> 00:57:53,839
reactive it's not proactive so that's

1365
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:56,029
entirely possible yes sir it is I don't

1366
00:57:53,839 --> 00:58:15,109
know what's it will help but it is other

1367
00:57:56,030 --> 00:58:20,030
questions yes ma'am um incognito mode

1368
00:58:15,109 --> 00:58:23,180
for all but well you're still going

1369
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:24,650
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the isp okay incognito mode is</font>

1370
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:26,240
only going to protect what's going to

1371
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:28,280
show in the index<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot that on your</font>

1372
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:32,359
laptop it's not necessarily going to

1373
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:34,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">protect what's going through the isp so</font>

1374
00:58:32,359 --> 00:58:36,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would think that the isp probably</font>

1375
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:40,339
still would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some</font>

1376
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:44,200
information any other questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1377
00:58:40,339 --> 00:58:44,200
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much enjoy your life</font>
