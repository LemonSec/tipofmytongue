1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
search operators and ways and not

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,369
supposed to use essentially you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,589
this to have a blog post<font color="#E5E5E5"> bug blog</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> post</font>

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">based on it's a note ghost I do but</font>

5
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:10,290
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that let's get started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we had</font>

6
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,610
some good times last night who<font color="#E5E5E5"> was here</font>

7
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,120
for dual core anyone stay for dual core

8
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:18,240
a couple people<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay responsible</font>

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,660
afterwards right very responsible so

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,490
Dorking what is it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we use so</font>

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,250
back in the day there is a protocol

12
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,650
called the web exclusion protocol where

13
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,090
it started out saying that google had

14
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,560
scrapers and that's how google search

15
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,030
engine works they send scraper<font color="#CCCCCC"> bots out</font>

16
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,199
and they gather the information of the

17
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,960
website and<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it into their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

18
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,250
database so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you could the way</font>

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,110
you're supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell that's where</font>

20
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,120
they weren't supposed to go if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i tell</font>

21
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,649
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to disallow them to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there but</font>

22
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,239
the problem with this is that when you

23
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,539
put it on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> web site your website</font>

24
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes my website calm / robots.txt that's</font>

25
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,960
always going to be there that's always

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,510
that site that's the robots.txt location

27
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,920
so if you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in their attackers</font>

28
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,949
all of a sudden know where you don't

29
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">want them to go on top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that they also</font>

30
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,480
have google bot happen to index things

31
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:09,390
they're not supposed to index to begin

32
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:11,189
with so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OWASP guide</font>

33
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,170
and this is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the very first things</font>

34
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,210
they use and as you can see there

35
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,350
there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different search</font>

36
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,640
engines you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can go through</font>

37
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,929
all of them show it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in most you're</font>

38
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,530
probably familiar with that one by two

39
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,000
you know all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that good stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so here's a</font>

40
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,920
couple of the more common operators that

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,080
are useful quotations search for the

42
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,909
exact<font color="#E5E5E5"> phrase sites restrict to the site</font>

43
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,289
file types you can restrict a certain

44
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,240
file types o friends with you work for

45
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,369
cisco gear and they know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the VPN</font>

46
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,470
gringe which is between the PCF file you

47
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,610
can type file type PCF and then all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

48
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,579
sudden you can find all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the publicly</font>

49
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,799
available cisco dumps all in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font>

50
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,380
URL in<font color="#E5E5E5"> URL that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> restricts it you just in</font>

51
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,229
the URL the pipe operators and or things

52
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,630
like that and then after<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do the</font>

53
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,490
search you can also do URL modifiers so

54
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,470
once you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the search you can copy and</font>

55
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,380
paste these in and so the first one the

56
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,420
QDR limits by<font color="#E5E5E5"> time frame and if you put</font>

57
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,490
in you know s per second<font color="#CCCCCC"> Denver minute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> H</font>

58
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">for our stuff like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that will restrict it</font>

59
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,699
to just the past down and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TBM</font>

60
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,970
restricts it to just blogs apps images

61
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,109
stuff like that literal no auto correct

62
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,630
that means you will never get an auto

63
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,730
crackers

64
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,920
and then the disabled the personal

65
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,660
search the personalized search lets you

66
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what kind of a bubble year so if</font>

67
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,820
you ever want to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get out of it</font>

68
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,860
and see what Google might show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

69
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:27,670
naturally just paste<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in at the or</font>

70
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:30,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">DB research so there's a couple of use</font>

71
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,739
cases and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was recently the yahoo</font>

72
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,750
hack was recently supposedly done by a

73
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">Russian and one of the ways he did it</font>

74
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:40,570
was identifying web servers with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google</font>

75
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,270
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you get you can get foothold</font>

76
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,950
you can get generic admin login pages

77
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,330
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find all kinds of stuff like</font>

78
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe like a credential from</font>

79
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,480
that the credentials might be reused

80
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,340
somewhere else you can do vulnerability

81
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,429
search you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go for pet certain files</font>

82
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,750
certain server types certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific</font>

83
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,150
versions of server types things like

84
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,220
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get verbose error messages</font>

85
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,080
so if there's a log message that you

86
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,460
know that has no just<font color="#E5E5E5"> way too much</font>

87
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,020
information in it you can search that

88
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,060
and find out what people around using it

89
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,130
you can do it for recon enumeration and

90
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,660
then again you know you can find devices

91
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:15,609
on it in a similar way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show damn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

92
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:18,609
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a recent airbus support they</font>

93
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,810
were an emergency 911 system and not

94
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,270
thing on twitter<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't follow him</font>

95
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,040
follow me as a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart guy but he</font>

96
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,170
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> said you know hey look look at</font>

97
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,120
this worm support site where all of a

98
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,010
sudden we might change<font color="#CCCCCC"> my user agent so</font>

99
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,070
I tell google that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm no longer me</font>

100
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:38,170
I'm a bot all of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden I can get</font>

101
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:41,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">their login portal so the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

102
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:45,190
footholds and pivots you can find file

103
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:47,230
uploads you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> your url mutations</font>

104
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:50,230
for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> too so let's say these two images</font>

105
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,299
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had were a file upload service</font>

106
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,040
that are based on similar hey um you

107
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:57,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">know underlying frameworks when all that</font>

108
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:00,429
so I took you know X you too and that

109
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,660
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in the the URL and I thought</font>

110
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,660
well maybe they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a version</font>

111
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,980
number so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried xq 3x you one things</font>

112
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,299
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to try and see if you know</font>

113
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:11,530
they were older and newer versions of

114
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:15,160
the same thing so vulnerabilities again

115
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:17,290
servers files logs software login admin

116
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,339
portal you can find crazy amounts of

117
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:23,470
stuff with this passwords database

118
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:25,210
backup files uploaded files site scrapes

119
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,760
credentials files again you can find

120
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,370
crazy amounts of stuff

121
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,710
and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the best thing to do with it</font>

122
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,940
is automate it as much as<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible and</font>

123
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,710
there's two cool tools for there's a

124
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,240
bunch of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there but snitch is a</font>

125
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,739
cool one and then what i really like

126
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,800
there's a new one by a guy named vector

127
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,140
and it's a it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called a like dork net</font>

128
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,930
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i like it because it allows you not</font>

129
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,969
way to use proxies they use a swan IAM

130
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bypass</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> google patches and then on</font>

131
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,080
top of that it allows you to import

132
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,270
custom list most of them have like

133
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,039
pre-built lists they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh enter this</font>

134
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,299
into it and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you'll start</font>

135
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,680
searching you don't tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to look for</font>

136
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,200
the vulnerable files one will do that

137
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:16,740
this one lets you import your help so

138
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:17,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so here we are and now i'm going</font>

139
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show you guys how to change user</font>

140
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,510
agents there's two ways you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

141
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:24,630
you can download a plugin for chrome

142
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:26,130
called user agent changer and you can

143
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,780
literally to go through and tell it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

144
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,960
useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> developer tool if you can see oh</font>

145
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,760
well what is my website look like on all

146
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">these different devices and then if you</font>

147
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,960
go down you can start telling it the

148
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">Year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob now if you want to do it the</font>

149
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,190
manual way because you don't want to

150
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,350
rely<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a tool you can bring up the</font>

151
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,540
developer tools in chrome here go to

152
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,970
network and the network conditions and

153
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,130
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is usually checked select the</font>

154
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,260
user agent automatically if you uncheck

155
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,420
it all of a sudden you can change it

156
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,250
again no keep in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that when you</font>

157
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,930
do it you have to reload the<font color="#E5E5E5"> page every</font>

158
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,250
time so every time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it will only</font>

159
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,350
work once then you have to reload the

160
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:05,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">page and then they'll go away but other</font>

161
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:08,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">than that so here's the robot step txt</font>

162
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,500
for wall street journal com and as you

163
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,480
can see here is all the disallow parts

164
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,370
they don't want to go into there's you

165
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:18,330
know some of the stuff to sitemap stuff

166
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,830
we're allowed to go to and we're going

167
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:25,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">to try going to one of them that we're</font>

168
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:31,229
not supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to so all the</font>

169
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:33,300
as you can see this is a part of their

170
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,730
site that you weren't supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

171
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,500
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to but yet we're still</font>

172
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:40,110
getting there without much of a problem

173
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,420
just because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we knew where to look and</font>

174
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:45,840
again you can do this admins will leave

175
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:48,090
admin pages like login screens all kinds

176
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,679
of crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff of it it's so easy to</font>

177
00:06:48,090 --> 00:07:01,859
find it sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of pathetic</font>

178
00:06:49,680 --> 00:07:03,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so let's start doing some</font>

179
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,550
because this presentation is going to be

180
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,409
half just kind of blowing through giving

181
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:15,450
you the basic information and the rest

182
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:18,000
actually showing you how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it so</font>

183
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:20,159
this dork right here it takes the quotes

184
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,380
and it puts phpmailer<font color="#CCCCCC"> perv 8 mailer and</font>

185
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,270
then it's the extension and put your PT

186
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:27,630
extension so all of a sudden you can

187
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:29,520
find publicly available versions of this

188
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:31,440
phpmailer that you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to use</font>

189
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">and abuse they might have default</font>

190
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:38,219
credentials you know stuff like that and

191
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:39,419
again for generic footholds you know

192
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,520
first place if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start getting</font>

193
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">into you can try uploading files for</font>

194
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,409
their site that well maybe shouldn't be

195
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,630
there so all of a sudden we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

196
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:54,420
through this and we start going to

197
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:59,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">Gingka or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so we got PHP airs it</font>

198
00:07:54,420 --> 00:08:01,200
sells so we got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hawaiian 60s let's see</font>

199
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:04,680
what happens over here in this one oh

200
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:07,590
hey there's actually two yeah so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

201
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:12,060
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> found a file upload page I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

202
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:15,810
upload file to their site yeah but that

203
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,850
sounds cool again<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

204
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,210
another one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that searches for a file</font>

205
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,210
upload

206
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,940
sudden we're just traversing their

207
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,360
directories let's see where we can go

208
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,919
now we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just I mean you can just do</font>

209
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,260
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much recon with this it's it's</font>

210
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:42,210
ridiculous so this X you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this is one</font>

211
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:50,670
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the example that brought up earlier</font>

212
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:51,690
and it brings us to this which is the

213
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">same thing we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just found with that</font>

214
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,500
generic file upload one but then we

215
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,390
notice down here it mentions that extra

216
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,980
upload be too and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what I was</font>

217
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,720
talking about when I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know Oh</font>

218
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,370
try looking at different version numbers

219
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,890
and new rating because if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

220
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,690
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> URL there it says X you two extra</font>

221
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,640
upload<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a first</font>

222
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,710
version make it Xu one maybe there's an

223
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,180
extra three now try doing that you can

224
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,770
not only you know take these door come

225
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,050
these are all publicly available you can

226
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,670
go to exploit DB for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google dork and</font>

227
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,770
database and these are all<font color="#CCCCCC"> just publicly</font>

228
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,300
available so you can create<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own out</font>

229
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:25,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">of one's others have already created for</font>

230
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:28,439
you and then again there's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know just</font>

231
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,200
some of the other ones Xu 1x you three

232
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,570
things like that and then you can also

233
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,670
just trying going back directories so

234
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,230
maybe that dork was just too exclusive

235
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,449
maybe it excluded some search results

236
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:43,200
all of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden we go we go back just</font>

237
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:45,180
you know one<font color="#E5E5E5"> little directory there and</font>

238
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,830
we're finding you know slightly<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

239
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting something different languages</font>

240
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:53,640
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's only three on that</font>

241
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:57,180
first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so now finding</font>

242
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:02,400
vulnerabilities this one is a PHP author

243
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:08,130
authentication bypass dork so the second

244
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:13,500
you type it into Google now I'm not a

245
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:22,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">robot believe me see how good of a robot</font>

246
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:35,970
I not<font color="#E5E5E5"> am geez Google there you go</font>

247
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:37,709
no I am a robot after all so there's an

248
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,910
admin panel for the very personal type

249
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:40,949
that comes up the piece band in town

250
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,480
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that and again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it searches</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

251
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,399
one that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a specific known</font>

252
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,990
vulnerability so you can go and<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

253
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,730
recent see bees that are dropping and go

254
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,850
and look at you know vulnerabilities

255
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,380
from last year five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and if you</font>

256
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,140
know what specific one you're looking

257
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,220
for you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just and find all the</font>

258
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,260
publicly available ones and if you're

259
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,910
using an actual engagement like with a

260
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,790
certain client you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use the site</font>

261
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,500
operator and then you can say it do it

262
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,760
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it only affects their site so</font>

263
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,810
you're not searching the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

264
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,620
anymore you're just doing their

265
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:12,029
particular website so this one again

266
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,329
talking about looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> very specific</font>

267
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:17,670
version by using the in-text modifier

268
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:19,380
there you can look for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the version</font>

269
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:22,019
number 7.32 and that again has

270
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:30,149
specifically known vulnerability

271
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:32,279
vulnerable files so this one here will

272
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:35,850
look for publicly available fire files

273
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:38,640
later<font color="#CCCCCC"> shared on onedrive so if you</font>

274
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,140
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what the client</font>

275
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,029
you're using uses Microsoft products

276
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">they use onedrive for you know uploading</font>

277
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:45,390
their files you can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> searching and</font>

278
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:47,189
going through people and see who shared

279
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,019
coming by exhibition in it maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

280
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,420
a Patroclus that I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> left somewhere you</font>

281
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,740
know maybe some sea level somewhere that

282
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,040
has administrative access to the network

283
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,630
left their password file on their

284
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:09,180
onedrive and now all of a sudden you're

285
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:15,900
just looking for so this one is

286
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:18,089

287
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:26,130
there's their authorized to you just

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that was hard right now this</font>

289
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,910
one is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look for recently there</font>

290
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,500
was a lot of MongoDB instances they were

291
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,780
being right white because they had

292
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,160
default credentials you know they were

293
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">left open on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet stuff like</font>

294
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this will specifically look for</font>

295
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:43,230
those types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers and there's still</font>

296
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:45,209
more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 pages of search results of</font>

297
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:48,120
them still publicly available even after

298
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:53,520
how many of them got hoes still there

299
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:55,020
this one this one's a really cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> one if</font>

300
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,490
you pay attention when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're using you</font>

301
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,710
know any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of website that you you</font>

302
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:03,240
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you frequent often you can just</font>

303
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:04,800
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well take the way the URL looks</font>

304
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,650
and then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one will look for</font>

305
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">wordpress backup file that often contain</font>

306
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:13,230
the passwords the users credentials in

307
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:14,520
them and here's a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> wordpress</font>

308
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:20,310
sites where we can probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> find their</font>

309
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:22,920
credentials like that now this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

310
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:26,160
really cool this looks for specific

311
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:32,219
versions of openssl that are vulnerable

312
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:35,880
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack and this attack again known</font>

313
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:47,190
for a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time now and there's MIT</font>

314
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:51,090
showing up really<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well you know so</font>

315
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:54,150
one more try out you want to passwords

316
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:55,740
so and this is really one of the when

317
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:59,250
you're doing the custom tools the

318
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,840
scrapers the automated part of it this

319
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,030
is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cool ones because you can</font>

320
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,160
start using it and search password dumps

321
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,870
and you can start thinking okay well

322
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,550
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should just scrape these collect</font>

323
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,840
them collate them and say well okay what

324
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,060
are people's most common passwords that

325
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,070
are you so i can increase my hash cat so

326
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,750
that way I a better rainbow tables stuff

327
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,300
like that that way you can find you know

328
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,100
the most common passwords and again this

329
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,979
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for anything that has gmail</font>

330
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,930
com and password in it so

331
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,880
this is probably people uploading

332
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:30,770
documents with their own<font color="#CCCCCC"> password leave</font>

333
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:38,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">the whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> company's in there no that was</font>

335
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:46,310
would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

336
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:50,450
search github for publicly available

337
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:52,250
passwords so it has anything at the

338
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,560
extension<font color="#E5E5E5"> CSV and then it has user ID</font>

339
00:14:52,250 --> 00:15:02,690
user name user example blah blah blah

340
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:04,130
and there is a scatter password list so

341
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,340
if you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the the default</font>

342
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:09,590

sick<font color="#E5E5E5"> pashtun yeah yeah and that's</font>

372
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:42,269
actually I'm I was having a problem

373
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:43,920
installing one of the tools one of the

374
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:45,179
modules because i had a demo that i was

375
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do with one of the newer tools</font>

376
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:48,540
that came out but the one way you can

377
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:50,579
get around<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is that tool users</font>

378
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">selenium and it uses web gecko so it</font>

379
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:54,329
kind of makes its way around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can</font>

380
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,679
also you know if you can put a proxy

381
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:59,488
list stuff like that you know you can

382
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:06,359
get stuck getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> by through that yep</font>

383
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:08,490
that's unfortunately just going on the

384
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,458
history of the product itself and not

385
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:14,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">really I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean what can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do to stop it</font>

386
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,529
the the protocol still exists I mean

387
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,819
it's the only way that Google spiders

388
00:17:16,529 --> 00:17:19,589
work I mean they would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change</font>

389
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:23,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what their entire operation</font>

390
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:25,619
probably i mean that's just it's just

391
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:26,908
not going to happen it's unfortunate<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

392
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:33,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you're going to do</font>
