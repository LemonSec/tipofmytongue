1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
somebody remind me because I'm

2
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:09,170
right-handed I should have felt us

3
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:09,170
through a little bit more I don't know

4
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,198
so this is Valerie Thomas

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,400
Valerie's bio got cut off so it's a

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,570
little cryptic but I think it's pretty

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,229
cool anyway this way so I think you

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,599
should run with it

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,490
security consultant hacker author Def

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,960
Con trainer public speaker social

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,739
engineering specialist and proud mom

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,230
scary to some but fascinating to others

13
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:39,629
that's literally what we have so that's

14
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,730
what happens when your bio one time they

15
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,789
just pull it from Twitter and hope that

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:48,360
it's not too embarrassing so take it

17
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:50,039
from me you should submit your bio on

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,789
time when they say I need this by the

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:58,680
state well I didn't think they were

20
00:00:53,789 --> 00:01:01,050
serious all right so Dave stole the

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,120
other part of the clicker like the

22
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,880
actual part that goes into the USB part

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,740
so I'm gonna try to stay fairly

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,298
stationary which is a little difficult

25
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,009
for me but I'm gonna I'm gonna do my

26
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:17,130
best so today I'll talk a little bit

27
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,820
about me but not too much because I

28
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,589
realized that we are running behind and

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:27,600
I am the only thing standing between you

30
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:31,380
and free lunch so you know my countdowns

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:35,360
over here and very aware I'll do my best

32
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:39,960
so along with my fascinating Twitter bio

33
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,490
I do a lot of different things so I'm

34
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,199
the technical director for the

35
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,079
consulting services section of a company

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,579
called secure con and we're based out of

37
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,619
the Alexandria Virginia area so that

38
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:55,250
means we do a lot of interesting things

39
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,960
and a lot of interesting spaces so

40
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:00,840
luckily not all of my time is spent on

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,649
government sites I'm a varied work

42
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,530
wardrobe we do a lot in ICS and critical

43
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,889
infrastructure uh-oh what's wrong oh the

44
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,220
other part of a clicker thank you

45
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:16,970
so I have a collection of hard hats and

46
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:21,770
all of my PPE here now this is probably

47
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:24,050
not going to work but the other really

48
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,810
nice part of that is that it also gives

49
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:29,720
me a really good exposure to a lot of

50
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:33,680
things so if I'm not at a government

51
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:37,850
site or a power plant it works awesome

52
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,650
okay we do a lot of commercial stuff as

53
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:45,859
well so internet of banks insurance

54
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:48,200
companies pause for the camera okay so

55
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,840
the cool thing about that is hey I don't

56
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,829
get bored B I see a lot of different

57
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:58,760
things and that means that I can sort of

58
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:02,630
compile some of my we'll call the most

59
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,910
common misunderstandings and the

60
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:07,609
physical and cyber security convergence

61
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,480
world and bring them to you all so

62
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:13,340
that's what we're going to talk about

63
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:16,910
today but in order to kind of lay the

64
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:19,400
groundwork for that these are two sort

65
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,780
of very different worlds so I have to to

66
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,670
talk a little bit about stuff that's

67
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,410
going to make physical security people

68
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,260
bored and then a little bit about what's

69
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:30,590
going to make IT security people bored

70
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:35,929
do we have any physical security folks

71
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:39,530
here today okay a couple hand hands okay

72
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:43,310
are you access control people or your

73
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:45,590
more other stuff they're like oh we're

74
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,870
not telling you that's fine okay it's

75
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:51,739
alright it's okay I won't out you oh

76
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:53,510
good for us RT folks and how I

77
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:57,110
personally got into figuring out

78
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,760
physical access control I started

79
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,890
finding these these devices on the

80
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,530
network during penetration tests and

81
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,000
audits and things and if you don't know

82
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,120
what these pieces are they look really

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,829
weird sound like guys what is this this

84
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,650
is I don't I don't know this vendor name

85
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:13,269
the web interface is awful well what is

86
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,640
this

87
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:18,769
so after hunting it down they're like oh

88
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,238
that controls all of the doors whether

89
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:25,610
allowed to open her clothes don't touch

90
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:27,679
that like okay but anybody on the

91
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:30,789
network can touch this this is bad

92
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:36,169
they're like yeah yeah don't touch that

93
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:37,669
so over the years a lot of this

94
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:39,650
technology on the physical access

95
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:42,919
control side has become not just network

96
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,960
enabled but network enhanced let's call

97
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:48,948
it no I don't write marketing material

98
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,020
but maybe I could moonlight but the

99
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:53,210
problem with a lot of this stuff is that

100
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,490
it grew at a time where cyber security

101
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:58,940
really wasn't brought into the loop so

102
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:01,069
it's on the network but it's really sort

103
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,440
of like we don't talk about that and we

104
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:05,240
just pretend like it's all good sort of

105
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,340
like how I see essence Keita was about

106
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,740
ten years ago nobody was really talking

107
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,299
about it it had a lot of technologies

108
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,130
that were implemented very well but

109
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,400
since like nobody was really thinking

110
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:17,780
about it like everything was fine so

111
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,549
that's sort of where we are today with

112
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,138
physical access controls except for

113
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:24,440
they're a lot more connected than Vince

114
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:27,740
kata and ICS so we got to go through how

115
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,990
some of these work and that sort of

116
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:34,520
starts with talking about culture now

117
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:37,069
there's a big divide here on people's

118
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:40,609
perception of physical security versus

119
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:45,009
cyber security and when we think about

120
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:47,690
it if we look at our first part here

121
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:49,580
what are we all doing we're protecting

122
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:53,719
valuable assets we're protecting the

123
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:56,419
same valuable assets the same ones ok so

124
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:59,449
if I tell somebody that I work in IT

125
00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:01,430
security you get the oh well you have

126
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:02,900
this chain of command and you know you

127
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,539
must be really smart like you're a

128
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,130
computer person that's awesome but if I

129
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:08,330
work in physical security I have a

130
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,490
different chain of command

131
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:13,520
that's very disjointed for my tea and

132
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:17,659
then I get the Oh are you going to

133
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:20,508
school you know like why are you why are

134
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:21,919
you patrolling fences but it's so much

135
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:26,300
more than that so it's very

136
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:28,279
misunderstood there is also a big

137
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,159
difference in one these controls are put

138
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:32,480
in so when we install access control

139
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:35,120
systems that's usually like

140
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,290
an electrical integrator not usually a

141
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,670
direct vendor so it's like a Siemens or

142
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,950
data access lay there there are a couple

143
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,390
names that they basically buy the parts

144
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,390
that do the bid and then they install

145
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:48,680
right and once everything is talking to

146
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,770
each other the doors open when they're

147
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,470
supposed to they're done out that that's

148
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:56,930
that's their part of the contract but

149
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:59,930
when we own the IT side if we're going

150
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:03,280
to install something like a new Oracle

151
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:07,490
database you know it's a very long

152
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:10,130
methodical hopefully laid out process

153
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:13,340
and that integrator that vendor is very

154
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:15,080
much baked into not only the

155
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,820
installation but the feeding care of

156
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,460
that system afterwards from a security

157
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:22,159
perspective and that that's not really

158
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,960
quite there in physical access the other

159
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,640
thing is usually once these systems are

160
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,099
installed like that's it like we don't

161
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,469
touch it it's working leave it alone and

162
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,780
it stays like that for the next 15 to 20

163
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:35,600
years because that's the rough life

164
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:38,450
cycle of one of these systems but on the

165
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,580
IT side we're like a catch Tuesday come

166
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,320
on you know we got it we got this hot

167
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,770
fix we got this we got to push that you

168
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,420
know that baseline changes all the time

169
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,430
but on the physical access control side

170
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,050
and some of the supporting systems that

171
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,180
stuff doesn't change a whole lot like

172
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,270
they're not accustomed to having to push

173
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,490
fixes and security patches a lot like

174
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:01,310
ICS and SCADA

175
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:03,260
used to be so we already sort of have a

176
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,790
very large divide just based on how our

177
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,940
environments have been treated

178
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,890
historically but we kind of got to

179
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:13,580
converge these together because a lot of

180
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:18,340
these pieces are very smart and they are

181
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:20,270
with far more connected than we think I

182
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,979
think I've went through most of this

183
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:26,030
already you know when you're

184
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:29,480
specializing in physical security you

185
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:32,240
learn a lot of things about force

186
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,789
control about access controls when it

187
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,190
comes to the physical side you know

188
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:40,010
barriers and Bullards and fences and

189
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,630
fire code and and things like that and

190
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,429
they don't really teach you about here

191
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,839
are the IT or no

192
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:48,229
working basics that you need for your

193
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:51,649
system to function properly so we end up

194
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,600
with a disconnect there and I'll touch

195
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:58,070
on a couple examples of that later on

196
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,779
once I lay out some of the basics so how

197
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,490
these little credentials are read so

198
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:03,380
normally when we think credential we

199
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,510
think access card right the badge that

200
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,040
most of you wear around and forget to

201
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:10,040
take off when you leave the building and

202
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,569
all of that but credential is sort of

203
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,829
the overarching kind of catch-all term

204
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:15,470
for that that could be one of those

205
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:18,440
little fobs fob tags that you have for

206
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,810
like the gym or a parking garage could

207
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,339
be mobile right there are some some

208
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,770
credentials that are mobile now that are

209
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:26,390
on the phone could be one of the tags in

210
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:28,370
the car so we have a lot of options so

211
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,680
credential is just sort of the catch-all

212
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:32,480
of that sometimes they'll slip and use

213
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,649
card interchangeably but just keep in

214
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,720
mind that these are not always the

215
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:39,320
little plastic PVC carts that we're

216
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:42,050
talking about so the credential in the

217
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,450
case of the fobs and the car it's has a

218
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,279
small little chip inside of it and it

219
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:49,160
doesn't have a battery right that's why

220
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:50,930
the cards are pretty light so the chip

221
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,120
inside has the information stored on it

222
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:55,279
but it doesn't do anything until it gets

223
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,709
power and it gets power from the reader

224
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,959
within proximity so when you hold the

225
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:03,050
card up the reader will give power to it

226
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:05,180
and the chips the lower-level ones will

227
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:08,300
just scream out like toddlers hi I'm

228
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:10,609
Bobby hi I'm Bobby hi I'm Bobby until it

229
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:15,170
loses power and then when it gets power

230
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:17,270
it repeats bless you so this data is

231
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:20,660
sent let me see if I can use the pointer

232
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:23,900
without messing this up no no I can't

233
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:26,029
okay so this data goes from our

234
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,069
credential to our reader here our reader

235
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:30,920
on the back side is actually wired with

236
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:33,200
copper so there are between there's a

237
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,110
minimum of four copper wires up to 12 I

238
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,430
think in that twisted cable there into

239
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,770
this thing called a controller our

240
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,899
little green thing at the top and our

241
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:46,399
controller is sort of like our bouncer

242
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:49,670
it's our doorman it has the list so the

243
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,260
credential is sent via copper to our

244
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,860
door controller or sometimes they're

245
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,500
called net controllers depending on you

246
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,870
and it checks the list and says oh okay

247
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,660
you're on the list and then it goes beep

248
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:03,210
and the light turns green and the door

249
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,260
unlocks and life is good or if you're

250
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,030
not on the list

251
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,370
or you're not you're on the list but

252
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:11,790
it's not the right time you might get a

253
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,890
really loud long angry beep or no

254
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:17,459
response at all

255
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:18,900
so our doorman gets his his list from

256
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,780
the server which is down here on the

257
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:24,030
bottom my adobe illustrator skills are

258
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:27,750
not very good so sorry it's the best I

259
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:29,939
could do and at least is not paint but

260
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,680
our server connects to our door

261
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,980
controller via ethernet so those door

262
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:38,520
controllers are very not intelligent

263
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:40,650
computers like raspberry PI's are more

264
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,740
powerful than most of these but a lot of

265
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:46,050
them are very old technology right so

266
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,000
when we and we've connected these to the

267
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,229
network mind you the corporate network

268
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,570
and they're probably not segmented

269
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,880
properly so you can see where I'm

270
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:56,010
starting to go with this door

271
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,650
controllers usually handle between four

272
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:01,530
to twelve inputs depending on how many

273
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,640
little pieces you add on to this so

274
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,470
think of this as like a server

275
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,120
environment where it's tiered so you

276
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,650
have several of these and then they

277
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,400
report to other controllers and other

278
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:13,740
controllers on the server right so some

279
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,020
environments have twenty to thirty of

280
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:20,490
these controllers some of environments

281
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:22,350
if you're across several warehouses you

282
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,340
know if you're in a complex we could

283
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,650
have a couple hundred of these

284
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,860
controllers and then you have places

285
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:30,569
like Amazon who has so many that they're

286
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,910
actually a reseller there they're not

287
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:36,450
even a client anymore because they just

288
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:39,000
couldn't keep up but our problem here is

289
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:40,500
that a lot of different people are

290
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,050
responsible for a lot of different

291
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,060
pieces of how the system works so we've

292
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,800
got physical security and their job is

293
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,079
usually to manage our credentials or our

294
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,199
card stock and out the cards keep track

295
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,630
with them register them in the server

296
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,640
our card readers and our door

297
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:58,750
controllers and that copper wire in

298
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,650
between that's usually an

299
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:05,740
grader of under integrator thing and

300
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,500
then we got the Ethernet connection just

301
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,210
that little little cable right there

302
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,490
between the controller and the server

303
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:15,460
you got corporate network guys for that

304
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:17,410
and then corporate IT usually the server

305
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:20,170
is like in a server farm somewhere in a

306
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:23,589
large environment in small environments

307
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:27,790
it's under so-and-so's desk literally

308
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:31,270
under so-and-so's desk mileage may vary

309
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:33,400
so we could already see from our lines

310
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:36,430
of responsibility here how a lot of

311
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:39,280
things that should be checked on and

312
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:41,939
feed and care security wise are probably

313
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:45,760
gonna get missed this leaves a lot of

314
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:48,550
gray area between kingdoms and as a red

315
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,710
teamer I'm really good at finding those

316
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,170
little holes and just it's like a

317
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,880
reverse Jenga like I'm really good at

318
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,469
finding that block to just push the

319
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,930
right way to make it all come crumbling

320
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,180
down so we're gonna talk a little bit

321
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:03,760
about a ways to do that so that you can

322
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,780
start to talk with the folks in your

323
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,460
environment

324
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,860
talk to your physical security folks

325
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:11,980
about hey you know I think we should

326
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,330
probably look into tightening up that

327
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:17,050
environment a little bit on the network

328
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,820
side I only have an hour so we're not

329
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,890
gonna go through these in great detail

330
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:25,750
how's that it's driving me crazy sorry

331
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:28,689
guys okay but the cards are usually our

332
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,790
credentials are the most discussed right

333
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:33,280
that's usually where you see most of the

334
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:35,740
the DEFCON talks and the hacking talks

335
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,199
are all about cards and card cloning and

336
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,490
whatnot we'll touch on it lightly but I

337
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,040
want to talk about some of the other

338
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,270
stuff that's not as popular but just so

339
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,550
that you kind of have an idea

340
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:48,250
there are different kinds of cards out

341
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,829
there in the credential world so the low

342
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,660
frequency is called proximity this is

343
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:56,680
the most common it is the cheapest

344
00:14:52,660 --> 00:15:01,089
you'll find these in shopping centers

345
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:03,400
and fitness clubs multi-tenant buildings

346
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:05,790
like lower end multi-tenant buildings

347
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:09,130
usually just a regular proximity system

348
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:11,790
the content on these cards is not

349
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:14,710
encrypted area for those of you who are

350
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:17,170
signal people 125 kilohertz is really

351
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:20,650
slow all right we can't send a lot of

352
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:25,300
information on that wave and wait for it

353
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:28,270
to come back so in comes the high

354
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:30,760
frequency cards the new sexy right the

355
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:33,130
new sexy 13.5 six megahertz that's

356
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,230
that's a lot faster awesome

357
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:37,390
more than 10 times faster we can send a

358
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,940
lot of data we can do encryption now if

359
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:42,910
we choose to do so we can we can do a

360
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:45,910
lot of things these cards are more

361
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:48,160
expensive and they are slower once you

362
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:51,449
start adding things to go on that

363
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,920
channel so although it travels faster

364
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:57,130
physically it could actually be a lot

365
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:00,069
slower than proximity and then we've got

366
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:03,550
multi frequency here and these are made

367
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:06,070
for large installations or large

368
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:09,459
companies that are looking to transition

369
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:11,890
so if we have a proximity a low

370
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:14,920
frequency system and we want to start

371
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:16,360
using something that has encryption at

372
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,990
the endpoint and we want something

373
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:22,090
that's more sophisticated that's great

374
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:24,190
but if you have hundreds to thousands of

375
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:26,410
card readers on doors and access points

376
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:29,440
everywhere you can't just roll this out

377
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,839
overnight like a like a Microsoft patch

378
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,940
right you literally have to go and rip

379
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,220
the reader out of the wall and redo the

380
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:39,220
wiring and redo all you know you'll

381
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,290
probably need new controllers so on the

382
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:44,800
hardware side this takes quite a while

383
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:46,810
and sometimes you'll have one building

384
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,140
that's on the old cards and one building

385
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:50,510
that's on the new

386
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,670
and multi buildings you know if you have

387
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:55,459
remote offices that use the same card

388
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:57,110
system then you've got to get to them so

389
00:16:55,459 --> 00:17:00,890
that's why there are multi frequency

390
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:03,110
patches and so that both will work until

391
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:05,569
you've completely transitioned to your

392
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:10,549
higher tier higher level of security and

393
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:13,099
then you disable the proximity part let

394
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:15,589
me say it again we disable the proximity

395
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:20,990
part when we're done this gets forgotten

396
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:23,359
a lot so we talked about those panels

397
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:25,400
and the cards a little bit right and our

398
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,879
card sends two pieces of data to that

399
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:31,669
panel it sends our facility code which

400
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,770
is usually the same for everybody and it

401
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:35,660
sends our card number and that's our

402
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,460
number that makes it unique that's how

403
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,350
the doorman knows that it's it's me

404
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:43,280
requesting access as opposed to somebody

405
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:45,439
else now if you just glance at our

406
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,168
numbers here they're sort of sprinkled

407
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,630
into the bitstream so there are numbers

408
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:52,100
around it and it's kind of padded now as

409
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,919
a security person you look at that and

410
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,909
you're like oh yeah that's for security

411
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,190
that's that's good that's a good idea

412
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:01,640
right actually this isn't for security

413
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:03,350
at all the vendors do this so that they

414
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,120
can lock you into buying custom

415
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,770
formatting from them so that you can't

416
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,439
buy card stock or credentials from

417
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:11,240
anybody else it is literally an

418
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,590
accidental security through obscurity

419
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:19,190
stuff however while that may have worked

420
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:20,899
twenty thirty years ago we have a lot

421
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:22,730
more technology now and it's a lot

422
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,340
faster for us to brute force and figure

423
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:29,960
out what that formatting looks like on

424
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:33,110
the computing side so unfortunately this

425
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,660
is not a real security feature and we

426
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:39,139
help clients all the time who are stuck

427
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:40,880
paying an outrageous amount of money for

428
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,820
these formats from these vendors and I'm

429
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,280
like oh no I just check it out look here

430
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,620
I got this we got these on eBay this

431
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,230
whole box and if you use this tool this

432
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:53,030
way you can write your own so we do a

433
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:56,809
little streamlining with the process

434
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:58,639
along with the security assessments if

435
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:58,930
we're going to steal some card data you

436
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,430
know

437
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,350
I touched on this I think a couple of

438
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,440
years ago when I spoke so we're not

439
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,310
going to go into too much detail here

440
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,550
there are a bunch of really great

441
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:12,490
designs for long range card readers that

442
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:17,500
will basically just read the card data

443
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:19,810
and save it all on a micro SD the reader

444
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,310
itself is about a foot square

445
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,929
give or take it's meant for like a

446
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:25,570
parking garage

447
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:28,090
it has rough it's about 1 foot square

448
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:31,570
I'm sorry and it has about a 3 foot read

449
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:34,659
range in the absolute best condition so

450
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:36,550
that really means about 2 feet but 2

451
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,440
feet away from somebody if I have this

452
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:41,050
in a messenger bag it's pretty easy for

453
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,120
me to do as an attacker I just put it in

454
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:45,399
the bag and I'll walk around especially

455
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,290
at lunchtime especially in places like

456
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,000
larger cities where everybody is sort of

457
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,190
crammed together it's very easy to just

458
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,550
collect the credentials and let it save

459
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:56,050
to the microSD now depending on what

460
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:58,899
kind of card system you're using and

461
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:02,110
what kind of readers they have

462
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:05,110
encryption that's ok I can buy some of

463
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:07,270
those readers and it decrypts for me and

464
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,590
because we're taking the data after it

465
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,830
has gone through the decryption process

466
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:13,360
I know how the unencrypted card data

467
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:16,480
saved and then I can just rewrite using

468
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,580
the encryption key I make that sound

469
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,040
really really easy it's a couple hours

470
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:24,460
of work but it can be done fairly easily

471
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,110
if you're dedicated enough so that card

472
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,290
data looks like this when it's saved on

473
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:31,060
that micro sd so we literally when we're

474
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:33,879
attacking a target we'll just go and

475
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:36,879
walk around and around and around and

476
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:40,030
we'll find the hotspots whether that's

477
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,190
the coffee shop the gas station the one

478
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:44,230
lunch joint in the small town it really

479
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:47,230
sort of depends on the client and like

480
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,700
where we are but it's pretty easy to

481
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,380
find a large group of people who work

482
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,570
for a company because they're wearing a

483
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,100
bunch of the company swag or they're

484
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:57,939
wearing their badge where we can see it

485
00:20:54,100 --> 00:21:00,280
so or words of caution about cards right

486
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:03,190
they are quotable it is pretty easy to

487
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,899
do the tools are getting a lot cheaper

488
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:10,520
now so this is becoming more and more

489
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:13,490
a viable threat let's talk about the

490
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:16,220
readers because the attacks are less

491
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:18,140
common and I want you to understand a

492
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,670
little bit about how they work so the

493
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,890
reader is the little box in the wall if

494
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:26,240
you kind of yank on that box a little

495
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:27,890
bit you can pop the top off of it and

496
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,370
then you'll see the copper wire that's

497
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:34,280
in there right so those copper wires

498
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:37,189
like we mentioned before the card data

499
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:40,310
goes between the reader and the door

500
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:42,440
controller so if we just put something

501
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:45,020
in between we can men in the middle just

502
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:49,070
like we do on the network except for now

503
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:52,040
it's on this wire side instead so this

504
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:55,399
little told the ESP key I think it's for

505
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:58,250
red teens wolves calm this will run you

506
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:01,280
about $100 and he's literally the size

507
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,510
of a postage stamp and that's what it

508
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,870
looks like when it's punched down you

509
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:07,640
only need four wires for this one and it

510
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,689
stays everything to micro SD but it also

511
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,430
has Wi-Fi in it

512
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:12,380
so you can actually just connect to it

513
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,790
when you're close enough or if you've

514
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,150
got some extenders out if you're doing

515
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:18,950
some some fun red team things and it

516
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,390
records and saves everything but if you

517
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,910
go to the web interface you can just

518
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:25,550
like browse and then you can select one

519
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:28,190
and just replay it whenever you want so

520
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:30,800
if my team member doesn't actually have

521
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:31,880
a card like a physical card that's okay

522
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,250
I can just wait till they get to the

523
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:38,690
door replay it and then open the door

524
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:40,250
for them a little scary these will also

525
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,550
work in their own little high of network

526
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:45,470
so if you install them in various doors

527
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:48,020
you know you can put them all on the

528
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:50,390
same Wi-Fi network and then you can sit

529
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:53,090
in the parking lot or across the street

530
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:55,130
or as long as you've got Wi-Fi or if

531
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:58,010
we're gonna get fancy and put cellular

532
00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:02,120
on it you can sit anywhere and just open

533
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:05,410
the doors whenever you want okay that's

534
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:08,090
a little cool I can work with that

535
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:10,970
all of the attacks that we do for these

536
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:12,830
kinds of systems are not all high-tech I

537
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:15,560
mentioned earlier we need two pieces of

538
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:17,629
information from that card right the

539
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,629
facility code which is not written on

540
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,190
the card but

541
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:25,260
card number is actually printed on the

542
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:29,220
card so on the bottom here 6:03 47 is

543
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:31,260
our card number so this is the I T

544
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:35,910
equivalent of writing a password on your

545
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:39,750
forehead that you can never change this

546
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:41,850
is a problem we will often do social

547
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,440
engineering calls and get people to read

548
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:45,689
those numbers to us off the bottom of

549
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,880
the badge and then I already have a good

550
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:50,280
idea about if there's a little logo at

551
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,720
the bottom now I know where to start I

552
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,750
know where to let's start looking into

553
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,030
the formatting so sometimes it's not

554
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:58,950
even really technically difficult to do

555
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:01,350
this they print them on the boxes too

556
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,330
for the cardstock so if you can

557
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:06,719
impersonate a vendor or trick somebody

558
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:09,649
in the physical security office into

559
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,490
reading you the information off the box

560
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,320
you can get the same amount of

561
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,580
information and then you know where

562
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,480
they're buy them from which is great

563
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,480
because you can just make your own

564
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:23,129
request to exit devices these are cool I

565
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:26,130
like these a lot that little white box

566
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:28,350
there they're designed to either just

567
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:30,300
release the alarm mechanism or release

568
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:33,270
the lock on the door because people are

569
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:35,760
lazy and they don't like having to push

570
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:38,070
that exit button or scan their badge

571
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,230
when they want to leave an area so they

572
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:42,149
put these motion detectors in to do the

573
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,440
click click you hear the click click

574
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,090
when you get close to the door and it

575
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,700
unlocks so that you don't have to be

576
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:50,129
bothered to hit the button because we're

577
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,860
busy people you know we don't have time

578
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:54,120
to do that it's cool because you can

579
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,310
play with them from the outside of the

580
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,260
door especially if there's like a crack

581
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:00,270
in between the two doors like this or at

582
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:07,170
the bottom this is actually from a

583
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:09,930
federal data center yeah I don't I don't

584
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:12,210
know why they did that but it's probably

585
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:15,780
still like that so very sophisticated

586
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:17,370
technology yes coat hanger I love that

587
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,810
we love our customers so you unfold it

588
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,399
you make a little flag you slide it

589
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,470
between the two doors and you wave the

590
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,100
flag and it will activate the motion

591
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:28,530
sensor and pop open the door if that

592
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,040
doesn't work that beam can be adjusted

593
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,350
like farther

594
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,490
routes are jerks like me can't stand on

595
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:35,760
the other side of the door and open it

596
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:37,620
with a flag so I used the balloons from

597
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,590
the balloon animals and like the little

598
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,879
travel pump for the kids parties so you

599
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,530
put the balloon through you blow it up

600
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,780
and then you let it go so the balloon

601
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:47,310
goes like this and if you're lucky you

602
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,139
get it the first or second time and it

603
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:51,120
will click and open that door if you

604
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,360
were unlucky there's a bunch of balloons

605
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,889
on the inside that you can't get to it

606
00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:00,149
so then you got to find another way but

607
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:02,580
this is a physical access control system

608
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:03,570
talk not a physical testing talk so

609
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,409
we're not going to talk about those

610
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:09,480
other ways right now door controllers I

611
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:11,940
keep picking on these things and for a

612
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,100
good reason they're easy to find

613
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,750
they are often just chillin on the

614
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,540
network

615
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:22,080
they have really stupid things open on

616
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:25,320
them but here's the problem when you

617
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,110
scan with your vulnerability scanner of

618
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:30,240
choice and I haven't found one yet that

619
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,010
properly identifies any of these right

620
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,020
so it's not like I owe the spenders

621
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:37,170
better than this vendor now like nobody

622
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,550
to my knowledge do you guys probably

623
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:40,470
okay nobody to my knowledge

624
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:44,310
probably identifies these I had to

625
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:47,430
double check so when you scan it with

626
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:50,399
necess or next Mo's or whatever it comes

627
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:52,080
up with like four or five infos and like

628
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,970
those really stupid not helpful ones

629
00:26:52,080 --> 00:27:01,439
it's like oh this is a general-purpose

630
00:26:53,970 --> 00:27:04,860
device but they're useful crappy generic

631
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:08,160
devices like their bold line to the

632
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:12,629
right person so on the IT side this is

633
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,340
why this kind of stuff often hides it

634
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,900
sometimes the SNMP agent on them is just

635
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,280
like weird enough to wear like a

636
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,650
vulnerability scanner won't pick it up

637
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,180
because it's not quite the same as the

638
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:24,510
SNMP that you'll see on other network

639
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:27,570
devices so you need to start looking for

640
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:29,879
these in your scans the problem with a

641
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:33,840
lot of the areas of responsibility is

642
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,370
that when the physical security system

643
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,110
owner is given the checklist of what to

644
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:40,850
give ready where the vendor comes in

645
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,850
they'll say hey I need a VLAN

646
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,330
as they're reading off the checklist now

647
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:48,020
remember this is not their wheelhouse

648
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:49,699
all right this is this is how we have a

649
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,770
gap right there's another wheelhouse

650
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:54,470
they should be having help in this

651
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:59,750
process goes to the network guy he's

652
00:27:54,470 --> 00:28:02,169
like hey I need a slash 24 VLAN yeah

653
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:04,730
network guys like awesome here you go

654
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:06,860
now what didn't happen there was nobody

655
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:08,450
from security came in and said hey wait

656
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:11,178
we need to put access control on that

657
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:14,000
VLAN so now we've got a routable VLAN

658
00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:15,590
and these things are literally just

659
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,539
hanging out on the network physical

660
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:20,090
security system owner is like hey I got

661
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:23,870
a VLAN I'm good right like you can't get

662
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:25,820
to that it's gonna be lling but we can

663
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:27,918
because nobody knew that we needed to

664
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,720
tell them network guy hey these are the

665
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,159
controllers you need to put around it so

666
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,890
we have a lot of like very small

667
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:36,140
disconnects in this space and that adds

668
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:38,960
up to really big problems if somebody

669
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:40,520
like me gets into their same thing with

670
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,350
cameras cameras are usually on their own

671
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,200
VLAN or sometimes they'll ride another

672
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:48,139
VLAN with another similar device

673
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:50,059
routable I mean you all have seen the

674
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:52,159
showdown filters for cameras right I

675
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:54,710
know these things are everywhere

676
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,649
everywhere the other problem with

677
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:59,570
cameras is uh well there's there several

678
00:28:57,649 --> 00:29:02,739
but one of my favorites is I like to

679
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:05,299
hide my evil files on them because

680
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:08,120
nobody's doing endpoint protection on

681
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:10,370
their cameras so five evil files that I

682
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,080
know are gonna trip certain certain

683
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:14,270
signatures on the network I'll just hide

684
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,559
them on something like this they have a

685
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:19,520
little bit storage space since they have

686
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:21,678
to be able to store all of the video the

687
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,929
server the server is a little harder to

688
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,350
find it is a red team person unless

689
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:29,390
you're following a DNS naming convention

690
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:31,969
then it's very easy please please please

691
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:35,750
stop naming your servers access control

692
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:38,600
dot whatever at domain.com don't use the

693
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:41,659
vendor name do not name it secure 9000

694
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:46,250
dot company.com okay this this is very

695
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:47,330
easy for people like me to find it now

696
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,429
if you want to practice and you don't

697
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:51,590
want to buy your own that's fine you can

698
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:53,179
just keyword search on Showdown and find

699
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:54,049
several of these that are connected to

700
00:29:53,179 --> 00:30:01,309
the internet

701
00:29:54,049 --> 00:30:03,230
probably not on purpose yeah but I'm

702
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:06,950
sure that's fine

703
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:08,630
once we've got server access we can do

704
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:11,390
lots of great stuff right so once we've

705
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:13,240
got access to the server and the

706
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:16,549
software on it it's very much like

707
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:19,279
Active Directory right so if we think of

708
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:21,168
of groups of users that have access to

709
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,029
certain areas at certain times of the

710
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:24,970
day right

711
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:27,789
same thing in physical access control

712
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:30,830
except for it's a little a little easier

713
00:30:27,789 --> 00:30:33,770
to just click and drag a bunch of users

714
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:35,570
and remove them from a group that

715
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:37,279
doesn't really sound very exciting until

716
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,220
you think about it in an evil way which

717
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,720
is sort of my specialty

718
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:44,000
you know ransomware is like the big

719
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,830
thing right everybody's you know

720
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,899
ransomware this and it's taking out

721
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:49,668
cities and it's taking out companies

722
00:30:47,899 --> 00:30:54,049
that should have backups and that should

723
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:55,490
know better and this is Ikey stuff these

724
00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:58,730
are patches that we've been fighting for

725
00:30:55,490 --> 00:31:00,110
years yes yes somebody is not an in

726
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:03,649
agreeing with me out there I'm sure you

727
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:07,270
are I just can't see what about on the

728
00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:11,479
flip side what about if we compromised a

729
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:15,049
physical access control system and start

730
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,909
taking other things ransom like I don't

731
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:20,600
know a little of this and a little of

732
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:23,390
that this scenario is far more

733
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,549
complicated than it needs to be but I

734
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:26,659
was presenting this to an ICS audience a

735
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:29,629
couple of months ago

736
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:31,640
so I made it look sort of you know semi

737
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:33,860
formal but really we could probably just

738
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,289
go from attacker to workstation to admin

739
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:38,120
access but I put a few more steps in

740
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:40,940
there there maybe take a little bit more

741
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,459
time and we've done this type of attack

742
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:45,409
before where we did get into a

743
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,659
workstation and that user was not an

744
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:50,059
admin so we had to find the admins of

745
00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:51,980
the system which was pretty easy and

746
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:54,789
then target them and then we had admin

747
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:58,279
access to the software in the system and

748
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:59,809
then we started moving people around in

749
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:03,020
those groups we were talking about right

750
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:04,760
so I mean this is all fun and good and

751
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,250
we're having a good time until it gets

752
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,330
to the point

753
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,330
we're Oh Oh

754
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:13,890
remember those groups so if I really

755
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,700
wanted to be a jerk and if I really

756
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:19,170
wanted to make money

757
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:21,570
I forget workstations no no no no we're

758
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:23,640
gonna remove everybody from the group

759
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:24,990
for the access to the buildings we're

760
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,700
gonna cause an emergency where the

761
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:28,470
building has to be evacuated which is

762
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,840
not difficult put your mind to it and

763
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:32,940
then we're going to push that update and

764
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:39,480
then we're gonna hold your building for

765
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:40,680
ransom oh yeah okay good times I think

766
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,120
I'm gonna call it locked out of heaven

767
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:46,710
right because no good

768
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,090
vulnerability is famous anymore without

769
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:52,530
a name and a logo so I'm still working

770
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:54,649
on the logo but I think that once once

771
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:58,290
people figure out that oh wait this is

772
00:32:54,650 --> 00:33:00,090
this can be done really easily and we

773
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:02,700
can get way more money for this than we

774
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:04,770
can for a few systems here and there I

775
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:09,480
think it'll be a new threat of brand

776
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:11,970
somewhere pretty soon how else would we

777
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:16,170
get some access to that that workstation

778
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:17,760
that the guard uses all the time why not

779
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:21,180
just target the guard that uses it all

780
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,710
the time right please train your

781
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:24,330
physical security people to stop

782
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,920
advertising that they worked arm

783
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:30,570
physical security at blah-blah

784
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:32,880
substation or at blah blah building this

785
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:37,050
is for a federal contractor recently

786
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:39,120
actually and they contract out through a

787
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:40,790
third-party guard service okay that's

788
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,929
fine they're uh there aren't that many

789
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,070
you can search those contracts and

790
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,840
figure out which one it is or you can

791
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:49,260
drive by and look at their uniforms to

792
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,270
see what the patches on the side and

793
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,740
from there it's easy right so LinkedIn

794
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:55,230
is the phone book for social engineers

795
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,970
and forever will be if I want to know

796
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:59,280
who worked security at this building I

797
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:00,780
just go look it up on LinkedIn I'll get

798
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,100
some hits and then the LinkedIn

799
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,540
algorithm will do the rest of the

800
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:08,219
finding for me we created a fictitious

801
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:10,290
federal discount sales program for

802
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:12,540
federal employees and contractors for

803
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:15,360
511 I still haven't got the takedown

804
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:18,550
notice from that domain so that's kind

805
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:20,690
of cool still have it

806
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:22,550
and we went through the whole deal right

807
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,770
and we're not talking about like lame

808
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:26,120
fishing with you know misspelled words

809
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,219
and stuff no now we don't fish with

810
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:32,359
email we fish with messenger and

811
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:33,739
LinkedIn because why worry about the

812
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,590
email controls and you can just bypass

813
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:39,290
them so this is a pretty effective way

814
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:40,910
to target the right people the risk is

815
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:42,889
pretty low if you've done your homework

816
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:44,270
on the IT side you already know what

817
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:45,859
kind of antivirus they're running and

818
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:48,020
what kind of controls they have in place

819
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:49,550
I only need to send three or four of

820
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,650
these messages before I get the hit that

821
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:53,800
I need and if I know who's working on

822
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:57,620
shift work which is really not hard

823
00:34:53,800 --> 00:35:00,880
those guys get super bored and for

824
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:03,500
whatever reason they love Instagram so

825
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,600
if I send those from like a second shift

826
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,610
or like the third shift guy is on he's

827
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:11,420
just trying to stay awake he's gonna

828
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:13,190
look he's gonna click so I'm gonna get

829
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,600
my access and I'm gonna get it at a time

830
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:17,480
where there's probably not a good

831
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,310
network response team in place so even

832
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,660
if it just happens to trigger something

833
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:22,430
I'm still gonna have enough time to do

834
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:26,690
what I need to do and get out and cover

835
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:31,100
my tracks before anybody's the wiser so

836
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:35,510
well that was kind of heavy what should

837
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:37,460
we do about that a lot of stuff so most

838
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:39,980
of this stuff is very easy basic IT

839
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:43,880
stuff that is preventable it's just

840
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:47,800
finding the needle and the needle stack

841
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:51,500
of the environment if it's not

842
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:54,080
documented very well if the integrator

843
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,970
didn't didn't leave a good list of this

844
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,549
is the inventory list this is the IP

845
00:35:55,970 --> 00:36:01,609
this is the location it could take you a

846
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:03,560
few weeks to to literally walk around

847
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:06,470
and find everything if you can't find it

848
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,520
on the network a lot of these pieces of

849
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:09,649
equipment especially the door

850
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,360
controllers are pretty fragile so like

851
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:13,570
this is not the time to just blast out a

852
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:16,070
bunch of packets to try to find them

853
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:18,320
it's like the umbrella and the fainting

854
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:20,210
goats at some time at some point you

855
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,090
just stay all fall over and when the

856
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:27,440
door controller stopped working the door

857
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:29,950
gets unlocked so that's bad clients do

858
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,170
not like it when you

859
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:34,240
light up a port scanner and knock out

860
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:35,400
all of their door control because then

861
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,598
they have to go put guards everywhere

862
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,200
until we can figure out how to get those

863
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,400
back up and running so hunt with caution

864
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,049
if you do not understand how these

865
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,839
systems work don't go just looking

866
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:47,829
around for them aggressively look

867
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:49,240
through the stuff that you already have

868
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:50,740
because if you're ready don't vote or

869
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:53,529
build a stands it's probably in there

870
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:56,319
already look for some keywords I can get

871
00:36:53,530 --> 00:37:02,380
you a list look for some weird ports I

872
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:03,579
can get you a list attack surfaces we

873
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:07,210
need to lock them down we talked about

874
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:10,930
that educating credential protection is

875
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:12,400
another important one badges right stop

876
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:14,020
stop wearing the badges outside of the

877
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,700
building and stop leaving them places

878
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:19,349
and so on

879
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:23,500
the RFID blocking card holders are

880
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:25,900
marginally effective the best one I

881
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,460
found so far is from a company called ID

882
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:32,589
stronghold that's what these ones are

883
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:34,599
here and they will reduce the distance

884
00:37:32,589 --> 00:37:36,099
that you need to be as close to them to

885
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:38,230
read the card it won't completely

886
00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:39,579
eliminate it but it will reduce the

887
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:42,220
distance to where I have to be a lot

888
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:46,569
more aggressive to collect that card

889
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:48,430
data without actually bumping into them

890
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:50,619
so they're not perfect but they will

891
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:53,828
drastically reduce they also have the

892
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:57,430
armbands for people who work in places

893
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:59,490
like manufacturing utilities who can't

894
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:02,200
have the lanyard around their neck

895
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:03,368
airports write stuff like that people

896
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:07,990
who work on the flight line these work

897
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:10,630
pretty well as well the the staff

898
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:12,609
education that was a big one we have

899
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:14,650
lumped everybody together everybody

900
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:16,480
takes the same awareness training that

901
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:18,369
we just click through and ignore it

902
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,839
hasn't changed in 10 years we know

903
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:20,980
exactly where to click and how to answer

904
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,160
the four questions to get our

905
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:28,000
certificate at the end nobody is is

906
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:30,160
focusing in on teaching system owners

907
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,790
and users of specific systems that value

908
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,770
very well yet especially physical so

909
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:39,119
look at your awareness program and start

910
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:41,170
to tailor that to the physical side

911
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,340
because they had they're sitting on a

912
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:44,990
goldmine of access

913
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,490
and they're surfing the internet and

914
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,169
they probably don't even realize what it

915
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:51,890
is that they they could potentially

916
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:56,030
allow to happen a couple of years ago a

917
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:58,580
secure Conn released a free packs

918
00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:00,620
security checklist so basically I went

919
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,120
through and made a high-level list of

920
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:04,580
okay if I was going to lock this stuff

921
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:08,180
down here's where I'd start looking and

922
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:10,580
this is written more toward folks in the

923
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:12,500
physical security industry so it's look

924
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:15,009
at this consult your network person for

925
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:17,360
this consult the security team for this

926
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:20,150
but you guys could use it on the IT side

927
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:22,640
as well it'll just be a quick way to

928
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:26,470
identify some of the attack surfaces and

929
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:28,819
start to explore them on your network I

930
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:30,500
am a contact information in Harris

931
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:34,880
please just reach out to me and I'll get

932
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:36,920
it to you we do this as a service but it

933
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,690
kind of depends on your company culture

934
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,280
right so sometimes it's really good

935
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:44,450
especially if like IT and physical

936
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:46,130
security aren't really buddies no thing

937
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:49,430
we'll bomb them faster than somebody to

938
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:51,320
mutually hate together and I'm fine

939
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:53,779
being that person right like you can be

940
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:56,810
mad at me that's fine you can be mad at

941
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:58,130
me all you want we'll get it fixed but

942
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:01,299
it's going to take out some of the

943
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:03,380
tension of the environment because

944
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:06,380
nobody likes being told their baby is

945
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:08,510
ugly great and at least on the IT side

946
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:10,130
we're used to a lot of audits and people

947
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:12,920
coming in and poking holes in our

948
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:14,660
systems and saying okay this is bad this

949
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,430
is bad on the physical security side

950
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:19,730
that hasn't really been done a whole lot

951
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:21,560
so it it's it's new territory and it's

952
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:25,130
it's painful right nobody really likes

953
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,770
it so but you know it's there are third

954
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:29,420
parties who can come in and kind of help

955
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:32,900
get some of that tension out and still

956
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:34,490
achieve the same goal question areas

957
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:38,660
though if you're gonna look at your own

958
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:40,939
here multi technology access cards let's

959
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,589
let's pay attention to those and the

960
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,900
multi technology readers are another

961
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:46,580
problem

962
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:48,890
there are configurations in the software

963
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:51,710
where you can turn this on and off and

964
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:56,080
it's literally a checkbox so some of my

965
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:56,080
clients they have very expensive

966
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:01,110
systems and they paid extra for these

967
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:02,940
cards at this extra encryption and this

968
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:05,100
and all these great features and they're

969
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,570
paying like an outrageous amount of

970
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,610
money for each card that they're issuing

971
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:11,340
and then I go and I look in the server

972
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:13,250
and they're not actually encrypting it

973
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:17,070
because that checkbox isn't checked I

974
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:19,020
can actually tell usually just by how

975
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:20,490
quickly between the beep of when the

976
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,380
card is read and how quickly the

977
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:24,660
turnstile opens if you're actually

978
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:27,390
encrypting or not because the encryption

979
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:28,620
takes longer because the keys are bigger

980
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:33,420
and it takes longer to send that data

981
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:35,730
over the air so we've gone into several

982
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:37,110
places where that was husband

983
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:38,490
misconfigured and here they thought they

984
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:42,330
were using encryption and they're

985
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:44,069
running and completely wide open so tons

986
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:45,660
of little gotchas like that I've got

987
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:47,430
most of them I think captured in the

988
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:51,540
checklist feel free to send me feedback

989
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:52,440
on that basic stuff that we handle and I

990
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,900
tea all the time

991
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,630
right third party a third party

992
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:59,040
monitored access network control

993
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:01,800
sometimes there's a third party that

994
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,480
runs the packs and that's fine they need

995
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,860
to use a VPN just like everybody else

996
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,930
like that should not be hanging out on

997
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:10,290
the internet so that the vendor can get

998
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:11,940
to it they they can have a token can be

999
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:13,529
soft token hard tokens whatever they can

1000
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,880
get on the VPN just like the rest of us

1001
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:19,800
can get on the VPN network segmentation

1002
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,330
basic software stuff you know the things

1003
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,440
that we've already done in IT we just

1004
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:27,180
have to kind of tune how we look at it

1005
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,770
so I went really fast to try to make up

1006
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,899
some time so that you guys could get to

1007
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:34,110
lunch on time and I think I did pretty

1008
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:36,090
good at an hour and I only took 41

1009
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:39,590
minutes and 18 seconds of it

1010
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:39,590
so right

1011
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:50,780
Oh questions like if you already go to

1012
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,220
lunch this fine I'm gonna hang out if

1013
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:54,260
you don't want to ask questions in front

1014
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:56,779
of everybody that's fine too

1015
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:59,540
if you want to copy the checklist shoot

1016

1017

get that to you if you want to talk more

1019
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:08,660
about how to integrate some of the

1020
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:11,800
service I'll be happy to help thanks so
