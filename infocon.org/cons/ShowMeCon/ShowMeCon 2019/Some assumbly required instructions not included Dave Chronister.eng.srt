00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,830
that's ever been ever been had and a

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,539
bunch of the hacking ones that have been

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,210
had as well and all the information

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,460
security ones as well it's been on the

Chronister yeah yeah thank you Dan I

17
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:02,940
think we tell everyone to give a bio and

18
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,010
I have a bio and every time I've had

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,590
that employee and previous employees

20
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,490
just go I'm gonna wing it and it always

21
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:14,189
turns out to them thinking this is the

22
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,830
ass that doesn't give me the raise on

23
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:19,020
time that yells at me what can I say

24
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,240
nice about him he has certifications he

25
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,869
travels while I'm in the office and then

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:28,589
he's on the news and that's it so thank

27
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:30,990
you for coming and thank you for sitting

28
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:35,790
in on my talk I took a couple years off

29
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:39,839
on unspeaking and I kind of hit a point

30
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:45,899
where I was I've been doing technology

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:49,130
for so many years 1980 I got my first

32
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:57,020
computer if you had an e 9 for a anybody

33
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:59,929
yeah BBS sirs oh yeah look at that a

34
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:02,369
momentary lapse of reason BBS sirs I

35
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:05,070
know there's at least one former systems

36
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,620
Mike I got kind of tired

37
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,570
you know it just seemed like year after

38
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,940
year after year it was let's talk about

39
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:15,299
the nifty little hacking stuff and then

40
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:18,420
leave show me Khan and come in and we

41
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,400
would then be overwhelmed with instant

42
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,429
responses on our dfi our side

43
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,980
it was never technology it was never

44
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,800
technology it was crappy security

45
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,480
programs and policy and one of the weird

46
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,980
things I started noticing people that

47
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,600
didn't know me very well I'd start

48
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,489
talking about policy and I actually

49
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,650
heard some young kids one time I say

50
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,200
young kids they were in their 20s say

51
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,700
when they thought I was hard of hearing

52
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:46,829
he's a policy guy he's not technology

53
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:48,209
guy yeah excuse me and I realized that

54
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,790
this is kind of where at this weird

55
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:54,450
point where people still hate policy and

56
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,340
I started the company twelve years ago I

57
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,170
could have told you that technology

58
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,760
would save you

59
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:02,130
technology's not you're going to do

60
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,170
anything for you without a good plan so

61
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:07,560
what I wanted to do is spend the next

62
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:11,309
hour and really talk about policy and

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,140
it's something everyone hates trust me

64
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,110
I'm an auditor I cried the first time I

65
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,829
realized I was an auditor and it was

66
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,410
disturbing

67
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:24,780
I like how crap I hate why I've become I

68
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:29,760
was Anakin Skywalker you know but it's

69
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:32,519
extremely important so without further

70
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,890
ado I did mention in the opening that we

71
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,420
have won a steam black badge a member

72
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,179
that wasn't allowed to come to the

73
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,970
United States if anybody's been here

74
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:45,330
before you've seen the tall Viking arnar

75
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:48,690
around here from Iceland and he's always

76
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:55,170
excited about coming and his visa

77
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:57,329
expired and so he on Friday he goes he

78
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,010
snapped at me he goes I'm gonna see if

79
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,050
DHS will give me here over the weekend

80
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,660
I'm like it's a it's a government

81
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,630
facility at work on a weekend and by

82
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:09,120
Monday he goes listen I can't make it so

83
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,680
I'm going to go to Berlin to drink my

84
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,620
blue

85
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,940
away and then yesterday he sent me this

86
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:21,560
so we now have show me con /r närcon in

87
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:24,190
Berlin and made my okan get in line to

88
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,780
sue me for stealing copyright stuff so

89
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:31,400
this is going to be entered into

90
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:34,250
evidence on the record that he did say

91
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:38,929
he stole stuff so we're already going

92
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:42,710
going to international when you describe

93
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:47,810
policy everybody uses the same metaphors

94
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:52,729
right you need the blueprints to build

95
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:53,990
your house which is true an organization

96
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:55,699
but you know I kind of need to take a

97
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:59,660
little different approach I wanted to

98
00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:01,970
really talk about a time where we

99
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:07,780
actually saw this play out in a whole

100
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:13,490
different arena happened uh 75 years ago

101
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:16,039
what war - I'm a huge history fan like

102
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,500
if I ever gave IT I might become a

103
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:22,190
history professor except I'm not going

104
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,530
to teach any places yeah one of the

105
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:27,380
questions that always comes up is whose

106
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:31,359
military was superior the axis are the

107
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:35,840
Allies and if this we're talking just a

108
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,669
100% military standpoint and it's real

109
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,179
easy to go well obviously it was the

110
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:46,448
Allies cuz they won really who was the

111
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,449
better hockey team past week

112
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:55,489
who won Game six were they better were

113
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:59,480
they better because the Bruins better

114
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:02,900
because they won it's it's not a simple

115
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:06,200
question as is who was necessarily

116
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:09,770
better but why did we win the war so

117
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:14,479
what part of the Army's was more

118
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:17,770
superior if we take just a glance at the

119
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,330
military let's look at technical power

120
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,099
I'm reading I'm finishing a book right

121
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,039
now called Operation Paperclip

122
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:27,650
it's about Operation Paperclip da where

123
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,419
we brought scientists over there's a

124
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,370
reason why we brought a thousand

125
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:33,590
scientists over including a lot that

126
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,919
were part of the concentration camps and

127
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,869
human experiment experiments because the

128
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:43,389
Nazis were kicking our butt in

129
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:48,669
technology in every single aspect of

130
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:53,330
technical power the access was winning

131
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:54,710
Tiger tanks those things as long as they

132
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,469
were started because they took two hours

133
00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:01,520
to warm up they would shoot a hole

134
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:05,030
through Sherman tank in no time every

135
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:10,359
Panzer was superior to its counterpart

136
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:10,359
part and tanks airpower

137
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:15,250
the Messerschmitt 232 Z buddy notice

138
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:23,260
anything strange about the Messerschmitt

139
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:26,870
it's a jet and the Mustang is not a jet

140
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:31,550
guess what the Mustang couldn't do catch

141
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:34,970
the messersmith's upper left-hand corner

142
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:37,789
you buy know what that is v2 rocket

143
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:42,020
there's a v1 rocket as well who broke

144
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:45,320
the sound barrier it's cuz it's up there

145
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,900
Mike reiten everybody wants to say Chuck

146
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:51,639
Yeager the v2 rocket broke the sound

147
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:55,039
barrier in 1944 was going Mach five

148
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:57,500
thirty-five hundred miles an hour it

149
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,960
didn't necessarily blues blow stuff up

150
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,800
the sonic

151
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:10,340
implosion or impact would disintegrate

152
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:12,740
vaporize anything around it the access

153
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:16,310
and the German are the the Japanese were

154
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:18,860
about the same at the time during World

155
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:22,280
War two it was estimated by the Allies

156
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:28,300
that Germany's technology was about 30

157
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:30,650
to 35 years ahead of the Allies well

158
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:34,100
we're all speaking English some of us

159
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:37,449
speak German why is that why did they

160
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:40,070
lose well it's not the technology

161
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:42,200
necessarily let's look at how their

162
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:46,780
chain of command was let's look at how

163
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:50,360
their operations were set up the Allies

164
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:52,790
had all of their and by the way I

165
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,670
realize I'm seeing a lot of gray hair in

166
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:58,730
here and I have big old clocks I can't

167
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:01,729
even read so I will give my slides off

168
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:04,970
to anybody that wants them they had a

169
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:09,500
chain of command where all of the

170
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:11,720
countries had chief of staff that was

171
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:15,140
represented of the entire company are

172
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:19,720
the entire the entire military branches

173
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:24,590
and then there was a clear and concise

174
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:26,650
aspect to the way that they did their

175
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:30,020
operations and their chain of command

176
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:33,790
now if you look at the access especially

177
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:37,210
Germany's it kind of looks the same

178
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:40,939
Devils in the details

179
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:44,230
up left upper left was the Fuhrer right

180
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,230
it'll fill er up er right

181
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:50,760
if you notice it looks like that there

182
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:54,110
are people that have direct commands and

183
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:59,069
he just has a few but there's four main

184
00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:05,340
groups the Army the Air Force the Navy

185
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:09,030
in the SS the SS had the tiger tanks the

186
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:12,210
army didn't and then in almost every

187
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:16,560
other case where he had delegated he was

188
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:18,930
able to override them so what we end up

189
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,520
happening is is what looks like it's

190
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:26,660
organized and it's up where the reason

191
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:30,030
the access lost especially Germany was

192
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:32,790
their plans their command structure was

193
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:36,000
screwed up it all relied on Hitler and

194
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:40,290
it all became backstabbing when we start

195
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,840
to look at we start to look at d-day for

196
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:47,310
example if you actually look at d-day it

197
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:52,290
was a failure we did not achieve any of

198
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:54,239
our goals at all we did not we only took

199
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,920
two of the five beaches within the time

200
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,520
frame people were scattered everywhere

201
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,300
it was a disaster why were we not

202
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,910
repelled

203
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,880
well Rommel everybody knows our when

204
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:08,370
Rommel the desert fox he wanted the

205
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,170
Panzers on Normandy they've been

206
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,920
planning for three years for this

207
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,240
invasion they had the seawall and Hitler

208
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,620
goes now those those are gonna stay in

209
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,660
Paris and Rommel couldn't do anything

210
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,580
the other problem was is the day of the

211
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,860
attack Rommel went back home for his

212
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,620
wife's birthday don't ever leave a

213
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,840
conference or anything early to go to

214
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:36,360
your spouse's birthday he had to kill

215
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:39,540
himself so that one change had Hitler

216
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,300
listen to Rommel his expert the best

217
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:45,089
paint commander in World War two d-day

218
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,709
would have never have happened it would

219
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:51,090
have been a complete they would

220
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:54,570
completely repellant technology didn't

221
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:56,520
matter in this case it was how you ran

222
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:59,070
your organization and make sure we're

223
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:04,290
and effectively and efficiently now

224
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:06,870
let's take this to your environment when

225
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:09,780
we talk about the goals of your security

226
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:12,750
program we talk about the goals of your

227
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:16,980
policy who dictates those who is writing

228
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:21,240
those in your organization are you the

229
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:23,370
security department is it some person

230
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,980
that it doesn't even deal with that area

231
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:31,340
do they even align with your company

232
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:34,920
goals what drives your InfoSec program

233
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:36,810
technology my favorite question to ask

234
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,360
organizations why go in and do a policy

235
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:41,760
audit is tell me about your patching

236
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,780
policy were you system center we use

237
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,420
wsus

238
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:48,449
no that's technology that's not policy

239
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:52,949
using WS yes for your Linux boxes for

240
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:55,320
your switches for your printers a lot of

241
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:57,380
organizations will buy technology and

242
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:03,360
then wrap their policy around that

243
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:07,290
regulation over PCI okay that's good

244
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:10,400
what else yeah my organization I own has

245
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:14,520
to deal with HIPAA GLBA sarbanes-oxley

246
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:17,130
PCI gee RDP anything our customers or

247
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,530
clients may hold but I have other

248
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,720
concerns I want to make sure that my

249
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:23,250
system doesn't get breached because I

250
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,870
don't want to go out of business well I

251
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,700
have that uncomfortable phone call I

252
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:30,330
want to make sure our operations work

253
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:33,000
there's more to it than just external

254
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:35,210
compliance what dictates your

255
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,460
requirements who actually determines

256
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:45,120
well we're gonna keep one year Bloggs

257
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:46,980
system administrator right well then if

258
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,240
you're a Linux administrator sent to

259
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,950
assist logs what are you doing with your

260
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,110
desktop logs are you actually doing

261
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:54,450
anything with those who's determining

262
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,040
those you start to see what's going on

263
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:59,100
here

264
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:02,189
we're gonna we're in a Germany problem

265
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:06,720
is your secure security program

266
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:09,150
implemented uniformly I can tell you

267
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,459
probably most people here the best they

268
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,149
can

269
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:18,189
say is I think so most people are gonna

270
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:19,959
say I don't know because after I became

271
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:22,449
an auditor I used to be in the banking

272
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:25,209
world and I had six banks which meant I

273
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:28,748
had eight audits a year by Federal

274
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:30,609
Reserve and Missouri after I embraced

275
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:31,660
the fact I was an auditor I realized

276
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,509
some things I can make people

277
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,790
uncomfortable and so I asked questions

278
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:38,920
like that because that's my job and I

279
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:43,118
get to and I do like to watch you squirm

280
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:47,259
so we help you afterwards right

281
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:51,579
someone has to ask those questions so we

282
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:54,999
run into this problem what I see a lot

283
00:14:51,579 --> 00:15:00,429
of times that happened in organizations

284
00:14:54,999 --> 00:15:02,170
is someone will determine the goals of

285
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:07,959
the InfoSec person it's usually the

286
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:10,899
wrong group it may be a business analyst

287
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:14,498
that's they aren't doing pci says well

288
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:21,459
our company is going to do this right

289
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:27,579
then they come in and they say here we

290
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:30,910
go they come in and they grab some

291
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:33,790
technology and then they build a

292
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:38,189
security program or security policies

293
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:41,498
around this so again what we're using

294
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:44,170
VMware we're using system Center we're

295
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:45,429
using whatever a great partner of ours

296
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,229
out there carbon black we're using

297
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:50,709
carbon black for instant response and

298
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:52,959
we're going to build it along that okay

299
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:57,790
well that sounds like a great idea it's

300
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:59,498
a great product but the problem is is

301
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,079
it's only implemented where you can

302
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:04,269
implement carbon black right so you're

303
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,638
not able to deal with some of your

304
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:08,350
device's your IOT devices your printers

305
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,780
different things like that

306
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:15,160
your backup solutions may only be

307
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:16,720
dealing with windows then the other

308
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,550
group comes in they put their own

309
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,700
technology in and what ends up happening

310
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:25,780
is is you end up with an ad hoc network

311
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:28,920
of security and you end up with gaps in

312
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:31,720
your security you don't even know about

313
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,400
almost every incident response and I'm

314
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,740
not going to talk too many about a lot

315
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,880
Bayden our dfi our guys going to be

316
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:42,850
doing a lot of tales from trenches later

317
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,020
is a policy issue oh crap we didn't

318
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:48,600
think about that

319
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:52,920
oh we're backing everything up it's good

320
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:57,220
okay but your backups just got encrypted

321
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:59,500
or hey the guy who set it up the the

322
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,720
goblets set up the encryption set it

323
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,300
password or key protected key encryption

324
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:07,420
and where's your key on the backup

325
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:09,819
server just wearing your backup key on

326
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:14,320
the encrypted Drive we didn't think this

327
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:16,179
through so this is a problem most

328
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,419
organizations have so let's actually

329
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:21,640
just break down what we really need to

330
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,470
be doing so first and foremost we need

331
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,570
to talk about our security program now

332
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,040
this could be any program in your

333
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:28,569
environment but we're at a security

334
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,170
conference so we're going to talk about

335
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:34,240
a security conference so you go in and

336
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:36,430
if I went into every organization and

337
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,970
said show me your policies I'm going to

338
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:41,860
see 15 times the amount of people in

339
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,410
here because everybody has different

340
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:47,889
styles of policy even within their own

341
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:50,350
organization so when we start to look at

342
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:53,650
a security program and our documentation

343
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:56,560
it is simple all your security program

344
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:58,780
is is to ensure that the goals of the

345
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,840
business are considered and applied

346
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:05,080
throughout all aspects of business

347
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:09,429
that's it it's how we do business that's

348
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:12,970
all we're doing anybody here have a

349
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:15,610
cookbook I cook like crazy I've lost

350
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,620
like 50 pounds I don't know if anybody's

351
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,439
knows I lost like 50 pounds doing keto

352
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,100
I'm

353
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,990
diabetic so I started doing that and I

354
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:28,070
if you got my Instagram I'm just cooking

355
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:29,629
all the time I follow a recipe and the

356
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,490
people put the recipes out because they

357
00:18:29,629 --> 00:18:34,070
go if you want it to taste like this if

358
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,980
you want to meet this goal you follow

359
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,908
these instructions that's all we're

360
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:42,159
doing here

361
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:45,980
I go in and it's like thou shalt not

362
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:48,350
they shall have a microcomputer system

363
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:51,440
and you're like who's talking about this

364
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:54,860
Moses you know it gets this it gets

365
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:59,360
really disturbing all we are doing in a

366
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:02,570
program is defining how we do what we do

367
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,269
in the business and ensuring that it is

368
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:08,210
followed by everyone and it is known and

369
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:10,610
crystal clear by everyone that's it you

370
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,220
do not have to add anything else to your

371
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:20,559
program

372
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:23,269
okay so if we're talking about this

373
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,070
first and foremost our goals are

374
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:27,049
determined by strategic planning which

375
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:29,330
we're going to get in later but

376
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:32,929
essentially this is long-term planning

377
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:34,699
on how the business will function you

378
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:36,799
hear me say how the business will

379
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:41,600
function and not how IT will function

380
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:45,830
how the security group will function the

381
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:48,080
biggest issue I have with IT and I'm

382
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:51,470
guilty of it is we are a group of the

383
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:55,220
tail wagging the dog who does that who

384
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:59,379
decides the business goals who

385
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:04,340
determines the business needs the

386
00:19:59,379 --> 00:20:10,009
business everybody say it with me the

387
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:15,379
business this is a good thing this is a

388
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:17,000
very good thing because if let's say

389
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:23,209
someone didn't do their due diligence

390
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:31,029
and do care what group didn't do it the

391
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:31,029
business who is not to blame you IT

392
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:37,500
well granted we're all gonna get blamed

393
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:39,629
anyway but really what it comes down to

394
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,420
we're support step we're custodians

395
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:45,150
we're custodians of data our job the

396
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:47,190
only reason we are employed is to make

397
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:49,710
the business more run more effective and

398
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:51,990
more efficient and I've seen way too

399
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:54,060
many times where the business and IT are

400
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:57,720
fighting business goals are not being

401
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:59,340
able to be met because I t's going oh

402
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,230
we're not doing that it's not secure

403
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:05,100
it's not your job to determine what's

404
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:08,970
secure sorry you're here to follow

405
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:12,719
orders you want to determine that go

406
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:14,730
start a company I never sleep again

407
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,080
this is my sixth death wish coffee I'm

408
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:22,020
up here shaking and my heart's about

409
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:26,129
ready to explode we implement those

410
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:30,629
goals we implement what was dictated to

411
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:34,700
us okay now our strategic planning is

412
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:38,100
long-term okay set by the data owner

413
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:40,680
anybody here take cissp with me anybody

414
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:45,179
okay you've heard this before go take a

415
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:48,240
nap by the way we don't do CISSP anymore

416
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,980
buzz Johnson in here Kevin well there's

417
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,200
two Kevin Johnson's here secure ideas

418
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,640
Kevin he's playing with his Wookiee

419
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:59,820
upstairs

420
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:05,190
awesome CISSP class now yeah phrasing

421
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:07,290
sorry long-term planning let's go back

422
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:10,680
to the war what was the ultimate goal of

423
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:13,620
the Allies we wanted to defeat Germany

424
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,380
most liked most importantly get Hitler

425
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:19,260
out get the SS out contrary to what

426
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:21,750
everybody believes not everybody was a

427
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:24,629
Nazi in fact if you go back to the

428
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:27,180
hierarchy the one person that was in

429
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,010
charge that was in the Nazi was the Navy

430
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:32,550
and that was cust Hitler hated the Navy

431
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:34,530
and and gurbles hated the Navy everybody

432
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:39,149
hated the Navy well guess who became

433
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:40,379
Chancellor when they were defeated the

434
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:42,900
head of the Navy he was the only one

435
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:45,350
alive and he was also

436
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:49,950
he didn't hang because he wasn't a Nazi

437
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:51,300
I just got off on Nazis here but we

438
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:53,220
wanted to get rid of the Nazis

439
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,680
we didn't say what we're going to do

440
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:58,620
d-day we're going to we're going to

441
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:02,160
build the nuclear bomb the ultimate goal

442
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:05,340
was at the end of the day from day one

443
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:10,380
to the end defeat Hitler defeat the SS

444
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:11,939
bring Germany back under control this is

445
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:16,429
going to be said by the business unit

446
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:20,640
not you okay this is long-term planning

447
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:24,690
high-level we keep this narak and I'm

448
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:27,440
going to give you some some examples of

449
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:30,210
these but these are not going to be

450
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,630
specifics necessarily that's more in the

451
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:36,809
details now not only are they going to

452
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:39,030
inch start and dictate what should be

453
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:42,090
done but your executive committee should

454
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:44,639
also be ensuring funding ensuring

455
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:47,580
compliance and they're the ones

456
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,010
responsible for due care not you're not

457
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:53,490
going to have your board members sitting

458
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:55,980
there writing down dictating well what

459
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:58,460
your strategic plans are but this is all

460
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,460
they care about

461
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,379
as standards and procedures they don't

462
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:14,159
care about that they don't need to

463
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:17,850
that's below right Eisenhower didn't

464
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:23,730
care how a taint platoon worked you just

465
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:25,830
needed to know they did their job when

466
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:27,540
we look at this I'm going to top-down

467
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:31,590
approach but almost think of this as a

468
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:33,600
bottom-up approach a pyramid right at

469
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:37,620
the base foundation is our strategic

470
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:41,639
planning our next is our tactical prep

471
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:45,689
planning now this is where you get

472
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:48,690
involved as an IT as in subject matter

473
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:50,670
experts this is where we actually say

474
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,710
okay someone dictated that we secure

475
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:57,780
data we're going to encrypt it using

476
00:24:52,710 --> 00:25:00,600
this software we're going to use SSL

477
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:04,950
we're going to set up a PKI server it's

478
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:09,929
going to look like this okay now again

479
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:14,160
this is technology or solution specific

480
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:17,610
because of that it changes somewhat

481
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:22,500
frequently right hopefully no one's

482
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:24,479
still on Windows XP Windows 7 we won't

483
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,800
talk about right and those of us on

484
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,230
Windows start dealing with zero-day so

485
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,270
we're all screwed okay except for the

486
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:36,330
boom to our Linux people going no we're

487
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:37,889
not it changes but what you have to

488
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,060
understand is the reason that we're

489
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:42,360
looking at this from a different

490
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:45,320
standpoint is because it is supporting

491
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:48,360
the overall goal so again this is

492
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:51,179
eisenhower who was the Allied commander

493
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,969
but he wasn't at the top he was the

494
00:25:51,180 --> 00:26:01,370
second structure down he's the one that

495
00:25:53,970 --> 00:26:06,840
pushed for d-day a long midrange program

496
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:10,889
to help push or to further the overall

497
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:13,649
strategic goal makes sense now these are

498
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:15,540
still we're talking in your in your

499
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:18,630
group this may be the windows group that

500
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:19,500
does this right for a lot of different

501
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:22,320
issues

502
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,450
you should have security involved in

503
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,850
there you should maybe have development

504
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:29,250
involved in there this is where you

505
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:31,980
determine this is how we're going to

506
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,480
look at the end of the day how are we

507
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:37,130
going to meet compliance of the

508
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:40,530
strategic planning it looks like this

509
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:44,220
simple no more no less

510
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:48,480
okay and then finally operational

511
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:52,610
planning these are specific plans with

512
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:59,820
milestone dates and accountability

513
00:26:52,610 --> 00:27:04,860
day-to-day goals okay so where was every

514
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:11,220
soldier supposed to be on d-day that was

515
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:14,370
operational planning they had milestones

516
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:16,500
they had targets they knew if they

517
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,969
missed them or not again that's one

518
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,559
thing they're very about the Allies they

519
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,659
knew they didn't miss their targets

520
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:25,549
Hillar still thought he was waiting for

521
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:31,890
the invasion from Calais say correctly

522
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:34,918
there you go so they're able to look at

523
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:37,380
that this is the sub this is done by

524
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:40,440
your subject matter experts this is

525
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:43,740
short prop for projects and when I say

526
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:46,620
short projects this may be building that

527
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:49,350
server that's your project creating that

528
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:52,469
user implementing that security okay

529
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:55,549
this is how our program should look now

530
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:58,970
when we start looking at our

531
00:27:55,549 --> 00:28:05,639
documentation all we are doing is

532
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:06,809
documenting those plans that's it that's

533
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:16,230
strategic planning

534
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:19,440
those are your policies the tactical

535
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:24,260
planning those are your standards and

536
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:28,130
your baselines and your day-to-day

537
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:32,158
procedures and checklists are your

538
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:33,560
operational now okay Dave you haven't

539
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,930
told me anything I don't know

540
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:39,000
well there's nuances one of my biggest

541
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:42,030
pet peeves is when I go in and someone

542
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,090
gives me a policy and their policy their

543
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:50,280
standard and their procedures are all in

544
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:55,350
the same document right and the first

545
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:57,300
question I goes who approved this you

546
00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:01,860
have to create your standards off of

547
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:04,620
approved policies right and then you

548
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,780
create your stamp your procedures to

549
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,290
meet your standards yet they all

550
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:12,720
magically came together all at once

551
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:15,090
you did never approve proceed stand up

552
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,070
procedures are sorry policies your

553
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,600
standards most people don't standards

554
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,139
they have procedures which is just blows

555
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,030
my mind

556
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,960
they know how to build the house but

557
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:28,950
they don't know what the house looks

558
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:31,620
like right it seems like nuanced details

559
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:37,310
but really when you start looking at a

560
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:42,209
healthy compliance and policy program

561
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:44,220
nuance matters because what you're going

562
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:46,050
to find is when you start looking at

563
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,700
information you're only looking at some

564
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,440
information you're going to miss

565
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,180
something

566
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:58,440
one of the other things that we have is

567
00:29:51,180 --> 00:30:05,190
called lease admit at least least

568
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:07,770
privilege right so if someone's going to

569
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:09,900
be doing your procedures does everybody

570
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:12,720
have access to everything that's a

571
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,790
security issue right if everybody knows

572
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,100
how let's say security operations look

573
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:19,889
how oversight works because you have it

574
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:22,199
all in one they can figure out how to

575
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:25,470
defeat it we want to keep these things

576
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:31,140
separated now let's talk about what

577
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:36,930
these look like your policies policies

578
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:39,690
are so easy they have or things for

579
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:44,240
things and for things only number one

580
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,240
why is it being established

581
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:55,970
- what does this cover and three who's

582
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:58,820
responsible for this and four who

583
00:30:55,970 --> 00:31:04,270
provides oversight and what happens if

584
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:07,280
someone doesn't follow it that's it

585
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:10,490
what you don't see up there we're gonna

586
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:15,320
put our solution in we're gonna actually

587
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:17,770
put in our procedures in there this is

588
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,149
all your business unit cares about

589
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:23,299
that's all they should care about

590
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:24,620
we don't want an access problem where

591
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,270
they're sitting there going why are you

592
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,559
using this technology and you're sitting

593
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:32,030
there going you don't even know what

594
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:36,049
this technology is right you also don't

595
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:40,549
want every update of Windows 10 to go in

596
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:42,379
and get your policies reproved which

597
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:46,240
technically you should be doing because

598
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,240
your baseline is changing every patch

599
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:55,120
these don't change they are simple but

600
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:59,889
they are dictated by the business unit

601
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:03,639
first and foremost you cannot outsource

602
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:07,070
the responsibility of any of your data

603
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:10,370
that's a big deal now right well we just

604
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:11,840
outsource it to someone okay are you

605
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:14,120
sure they're doing the right thing show

606
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,600
me your vendor due diligence we're big

607
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:20,270
on outsourcing I get it it's cheaper but

608
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,280
you still need to have directives for

609
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,870
your vendors and now you also have

610
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:27,200
vendor do diligence you have to deal

611
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:29,449
with you can't just say well they're

612
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,590
done if they get breached guess whose

613
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:35,210
problem it is yours you need to make

614
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:37,189
sure a function is responsible for

615
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:39,970
control talking to someone earlier today

616
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:42,740
and they're like yeah RI RI our program

617
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:45,500
we had people listed in there that

618
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:49,429
weren't even with the company anymore

619
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:52,640
why are people in there it may be your

620
00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:55,549
CIO maybe your C so it may be done yeah

621
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,700
your security group it's a function it's

622
00:32:55,549 --> 00:33:01,010
a group it's never a specific

623
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:03,050
person's name you're going to run into

624
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:06,370
problems whenever you have turnover you

625
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:09,350
have to get your policies re-approved

626
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:13,340
because you have to change it everybody

627
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:17,480
understands this aspect right everybody

628
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:20,780
here gets their policies RIA proved by

629
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:30,050
the business unit every time you make a

630
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:33,830
change correct yeah yeah we do by the

631
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:36,770
way I'm not I'm not immune to this work

632
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:43,270
USA's is anybody here from the PCI

633
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:47,629
Council they're evil I have to get

634
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:49,850
audited by PCI and I get audited by

635
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:54,380
someone when you say public network they

636
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:55,939
go what's that and I go you know or the

637
00:33:54,380 --> 00:34:01,400
whole thing of what we keep everything

638
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:03,650
in all of our data locked and on USB

639
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:08,230
well how do you deal with cloud

640
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:12,139
solutions did you just not hear me

641
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:14,179
12-month audit so I understand but I a

642
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:16,339
lot of times go it's changed was it

643
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:21,859
reviewed by your board yes it was on the

644
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:23,990
board so I can do that oversight you

645
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,910
need to make sure you have an

646
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:28,609
independent organization making sure

647
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:31,639
that it is being followed that it's

648
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:35,420
being followed via the wishes of the

649
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:40,009
board and that we can do any sort of

650
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:42,230
measurement of success or not it should

651
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:44,330
never be two pages in fact I'm always

652
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:48,230
surprised when someone has a two page

653
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:51,080
policy you should never have a two page

654
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:52,730
policy well at 10:12 and I'm talking

655
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,860
about a wireless policy I'm talking

656
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:58,130
about patching baozi talking about a

657
00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:00,890
data security policy these are generic

658
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:03,440
we use generic terms all it is is

659
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:05,870
basically we as the board see a need for

660
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,410
this we want to establish this this part

661
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,930
this phone

662
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:12,500
action is responsible for it this group

663
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:15,288
is responsible for oversight and is a

664
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,910
requirement of employment with our

665
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:19,789
organization

666
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:23,868
you know punishment includes an up to

667
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:26,930
death and torture right you're done yeah

668
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:28,640
don't you wish there would be at least

669
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:39,410
five less attendees here if I can do

670
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:43,549
that alright sorry Dan standards this is

671
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:46,339
where you come in okay yeah you have a

672
00:35:43,549 --> 00:35:49,130
data security program the data that they

673
00:35:46,339 --> 00:35:52,038
basically say listen we understand that

674
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:55,010
we have needs regulatory we have other

675
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:57,770
needs of identifying classifying data

676
00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:01,549
and that we need to hold it at its

677
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:03,710
proper security level that your policy

678
00:36:01,549 --> 00:36:05,089
well what does this mean well it means

679
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:09,470
different things for different groups

680
00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:12,670
right so this is where we start talking

681
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:16,098
about the technologies this is how we

682
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:20,869
deal with disk encryption this is how we

683
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:23,829
deal with you know email encryption this

684
00:36:20,869 --> 00:36:28,549
is how we deal with data classification

685
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:30,410
these are all standards now again we're

686
00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:33,200
a level down here right we're in

687
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:35,750
tactical now we need to make sure our

688
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:41,089
solution meets the requirements set by

689
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:44,450
the policy are these being approved by

690
00:36:41,089 --> 00:36:46,430
the board by the business unit no they

691
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:49,669
have oversight to make sure that this is

692
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:53,089
meeting policy they support the one

693
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:56,240
above them every time but this takes out

694
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:58,369
a level of that bureaucracy in there the

695
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,129
other reason that we need to start

696
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:04,970
looking at it from the standpoint of it

697
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:07,299
being separate is because information

698
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:11,328
security comes in many different forms

699
00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:13,788
we have multiple technology in the same

700
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:16,190
environment trying to cover every piece

701
00:37:13,789 --> 00:37:16,660
of technology in the entire environment

702
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,390
with

703
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:21,129
once paragraph you're going to miss

704
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:24,970
something or it's not going to be

705
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:28,690
specific okay so it allows us to have

706
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:33,339
multiple standards underneath okay this

707
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:35,650
may be product related we will set

708
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:38,788
baselines this has to be implemented

709
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:42,609
through the organization okay

710
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:46,839
we require that everybody's running

711
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:53,470
Windows 10 whatever the last two patches

712
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:56,049
work right it's a requirement okay

713
00:37:53,470 --> 00:38:01,828
and this is how we ensure we are meeting

714
00:37:56,049 --> 00:38:06,119
the policies finally our procedures

715
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:08,980
essentially all our procedures are our

716
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:12,569
step-by-step tasks to meet those

717
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:15,510
standards that's all we're doing here

718
00:38:12,569 --> 00:38:20,079
okay now some of the biggest mistakes

719
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:23,579
that I see number one it should be step

720
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:26,380
by step I'll talk about this later

721
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:28,329
I've heard people say you need to write

722
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:33,069
good procedure where anybody can sit

723
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:35,109
down really and do it so you're

724
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:37,900
president of your company can sit down

725
00:38:35,109 --> 00:38:40,720
and build a your you know start handing

726
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:46,150
out certificates if you're PKI

727
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:49,359
administrators not available no I don't

728
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:53,400
even do that what you're dealing with

729
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:56,770
there is it's people with the right

730
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:59,260
skill set anybody should be able to sit

731
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:05,020
down and look at and be able to

732
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:09,369
replicate what your standard is okay it

733
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:13,230
is created by the people that created

734
00:39:09,369 --> 00:39:16,900
the standards and the people using the

735
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:22,410
policy for the most part are sorry the

736
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:26,049
procedure if you're the Windows

737
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:28,480
administration team you should be the

738
00:39:26,049 --> 00:39:29,500
ones creating the procedure to implement

739
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,820
security

740
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,040
this brings up a whole nother discussion

741
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:36,850
of what is your security group therefore

742
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:38,470
some people do it the their oversight

743
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:42,210
other people say they implement the

744
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:46,629
security who's responsible for security

745
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:49,510
every one that second point doesn't make

746
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:55,870
any sense it kind of you're not baking

747
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:57,640
it into your everyday processes okay all

748
00:39:55,870 --> 00:40:00,460
this is doing is this is ensuring that

749
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:03,250
your standards are met screenshots are

750
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:06,790
great screenshots are awesome picture is

751
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:10,230
worth a thousand words right screenshot

752
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:12,910
screenshot screenshot screenshot do it

753
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:16,240
you should be able to get a newb come in

754
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:19,560
and be able to follow those policies now

755
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:24,040
I had a guy I worked with at the bank

756
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:25,960
and has up in Troy Missouri which is

757
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,660
anybody here from Troy Missouri okay

758
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,490
sorry

759
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:32,170
as a crazy place first time I ever met

760
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:36,069
my boss he was carrying two shotguns

761
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:39,100
across the bank and it got crazier from

762
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:40,900
there they were a client of ours and

763
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,089
every one of my employees that went up

764
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,520
there went holy crap this is what you

765
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:47,410
dealt with I'm like yes I told you they

766
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,820
threw the nitroglycerin in the elevator

767
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:51,379
shaft it's insane

768
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:55,460
I had this guy

769
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:58,400
I had a small office and it looked into

770
00:40:55,460 --> 00:41:00,260
the data room and of course because it's

771
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,570
a data center we had all of our printers

772
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:04,250
in there we had people in there and it

773
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:08,230
was at 80 degrees because someone always

774
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:11,570
got cold it worked out great but the

775
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:14,930
operations manager every day he would go

776
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:18,590
over to the to the bookshelf pull his

777
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:21,049
procedure out set it down open it up and

778
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:26,170
start following it I actually would

779
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:31,310
watch his finger go like that every time

780
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:33,080
every single time that annoyed me to

781
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:34,790
death I'm like dude you've been working

782
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,000
here 20 years you should know how to do

783
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:39,410
your job every day

784
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,020
now I'm an auditor I go okay that's kind

785
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:43,190
of cool but for the rest of you that are

786
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:49,490
not doing that

787
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:52,340
I really recommend checklist when I

788
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:55,129
started there I was I I set the standard

789
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:57,230
for the desktops for example or will

790
00:41:55,130 --> 00:42:00,470
take parameter we've set up a

791
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:03,380
methodology for doing a pen test right

792
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:05,270
and it's long and we're doc we've

793
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:08,780
documented do you think my pen testers

794
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:14,780
open that procedure every single time no

795
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:16,580
they don't they know it they do it every

796
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:20,140
day but we need to make sure something's

797
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:22,400
not missed so we use a checklist okay

798
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:25,160
now what's really nice about the

799
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,840
procedures maybe they get into something

800
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,839
they haven't done in a while they can

801
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,830
pull that procedure out and look at it

802
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,950
but they're not going to look at every

803
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:36,650
one of them the other nice thing about

804
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:42,950
audit about our checklist is they can

805
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:47,000
become audit trails so in our project

806
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:49,879
software every project every procedure

807
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:54,050
there's a checklist and they sign off

808
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:57,350
that they did it so some comes up we

809
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:59,810
know what happened okay checklist our

810
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:02,900
amazing checklists are awesome they get

811
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:04,029
a bad rap man I was up here right before

812
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,300
I did the intrud

813
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:11,560
action doing a checklist of things to do

814
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:17,940
I'm the smartest person in my mind and I

815
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:23,190
forget stuff that was a joke I'm sorry

816
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:26,370
people like my god this dude he is just

817
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:29,680
why do you have a security program well

818
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:33,069
stupid boss made sure we got credit card

819
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:36,160
readers now we're PCI we have to deal

820
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:38,410
with people's stupid health care my

821
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:43,210
brother works for a large company in

822

town and don't Pullum I said this if you

823
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:48,610
guys know every fat family gathering

824
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,420
he's like you know my security

825
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:56,020
departments making me do now

826
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:59,140
and I'm like Mike yeah they are because

827
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:01,180
they kick ass and you're bringing me

828
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:04,120
join two ways as a little brother seeing

829
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:12,480
my brother upset is happy as a security

830
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:14,950
professional happy this is nothing okay

831
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,890
what people do is they'll take HIPPA

832
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:21,069
they'll take PCI sarbanes-oxley they'll

833
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:24,520
they'll use it as the exclusive purpose

834
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:27,100
of their security program you don't do

835
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,620
that now you can drive security I found

836
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:33,279
that out at the bank glba

837
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:38,200
my boss and I called the he was about 80

838
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:39,850
some years old right Oh Mike this and

839
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:43,660
you know everything was god damn it

840
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:45,400
heads a drum roll that's what he did

841
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:48,910
and I actually found the way to get

842
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:53,140
stuff around him was GLBA well GLBA says

843
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:54,970
this to them and you know he just said

844
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:58,270
in his dentist's chair like this and it

845
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:59,830
was disturbing best advice I can give

846
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:02,799
you is if you have someone like this my

847
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:05,890
boss was incredible he was an incredible

848
00:45:02,799 --> 00:45:07,660
I have to give him credit he couldn't

849
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:11,618
tell you what year was one time we had

850
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:13,209
an argument about being 1984 but he

851
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:14,559
looked at my del bill one time and just

852
00:45:13,209 --> 00:45:17,229
looked at and went they charge shipping

853
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:23,140
wrong I'm like are you kidding me

854
00:45:17,229 --> 00:45:25,989
and yeah they did I explained to him I

855
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:28,749
go okay Donald you can have secure you

856
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:32,499
can have usable I go you're the boss

857
00:45:28,749 --> 00:45:34,509
who's right I'm the boss I said the more

858
00:45:32,499 --> 00:45:36,669
usable you are the less secure the more

859
00:45:34,509 --> 00:45:39,249
secure yard the less usable pier six

860
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:42,729
point great kind of looked at it looked

861
00:45:39,249 --> 00:45:46,899
up at me down it looked up at me and he

862
00:45:42,729 --> 00:45:49,178
goes I want to be right there I go okay

863
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:53,079
I circled it I said okay sign this and

864
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:54,849
so he would forget it but if he signed

865
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:57,519
something it was worth gold

866
00:45:54,849 --> 00:45:59,650
I had my golden ticket so anytime I

867
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:02,379
needed something I would go he go I

868
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:04,059
can't pay for this I'd go but you're

869
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,929
right here and that's what that means

870
00:46:04,059 --> 00:46:08,380
okay

871
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:11,319
and so we would pay for it where I'm

872
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:13,569
getting at with this is your security

873
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:16,150
compliance your external compliance is

874
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:16,630
just another factor of how you do

875
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:19,900
business

876
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:24,069
your hospital HIPAA is a factor it's not

877
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:26,529
the only factor right your retail credit

878
00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:28,660
cards are a factor it's not your only

879
00:46:26,529 --> 00:46:31,150
factor this comes into the strategic

880
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:34,420
planning and when you start to do your

881
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:39,789
tactical there may be some technology

882
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:41,679
specifics that you have to address now

883
00:46:39,789 --> 00:46:44,349
as we're going to see I'm going to start

884
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:47,259
to put this into play as we see this can

885
00:46:44,349 --> 00:46:48,939
get out of control really quick did we

886
00:46:47,259 --> 00:46:52,380
think of this then we think of this did

887
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:54,999
we think of this then we think of this

888
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:58,479
this is what frameworks come into play

889
00:46:54,999 --> 00:47:01,618
what frameworks the best the one that

890
00:46:58,479 --> 00:47:01,618
you actually use

891
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:09,080
all right now a framework is just that a

892
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:11,720
framework it does not build your

893
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:15,069
security program for you it helps you

894
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:17,450
look at the different aspects of it okay

895
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:20,300
don't don't be that person

896
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:22,370
well you know what's your I had this

897
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:25,010
actually happen can you show me your

898
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:31,220
security program and they they gave me

899
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:34,370
ISO 27001 and I go guys guys let's go

900
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:39,290
have a drink it's 10:00 a.m. you're

901
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:41,000
gonna need one they do help them they

902
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:42,230
help you be consistent they help you

903
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,250
think of everything

904
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:47,630
you know man towards the end there

905
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:50,000
someone asked the question about what

906
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:53,360
happens if you're blue you don't have

907
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,470
enough red and he kind of you know one

908
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,440
of the things we were kind of talking

909
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:59,600
about there was operational blindness

910
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:03,530
right and what that is is when you're

911
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:06,970
dealing with things every single day you

912
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:10,340
miss stuff because it's out of mind

913
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:12,830
that's why companies like mine exist I'm

914
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:13,970
not better at your technology I'm just

915
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:18,230
looking at it from a different

916
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:20,480
standpoint okay frameworks help with

917
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:23,690
that and they're good things to use even

918
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:28,390
if you're using PCI and making it sound

919
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:28,390
depressing but it's better than nothing

920
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:35,270
now a hundred percent compliant

921
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:38,330
complaints is impossible just look at

922
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:43,009
your patching policy as everybody up to

923
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:44,480
date I'm patching know I had a I had a

924
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:47,890
certain black badge member here we

925
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:51,170
always forgot what they STL sec was and

926
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:53,210
and he goes it's reboot wednesday free

927
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:55,160
boot wednesday he looked at me like I

928
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:57,620
had three heads and he goes you know

929
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:00,560
Patch Tuesday free boot Wednesday I go

930
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:05,270
you don't test your patches I'm human

931
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:08,810
oh sorry you're always going to have

932
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:10,910
something that doesn't that doesn't meet

933
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:13,220
the baseline it's going to happen

934
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:17,379
these are gaps in your security but

935
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:21,169
they're inevitable these are exceptions

936
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:26,060
okay I hated the word exception when I

937
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:29,240
was a VP of IT I hated exception as

938
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:31,490
administrator I loved it now I'll tell

939
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:34,399
you from incident response it's great

940
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:39,020
you know where your gaps are this also

941
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:41,510
allows you to keep track of them and you

942
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:47,210
can also maybe determine the duration I

943
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:48,950
had a certain um power company a city

944
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:53,120
about the size st. Louis in the West

945
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:56,029
Coast this was about 10 years ago then

946
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:58,540
and I were in New York and I was running

947
00:49:56,030 --> 00:50:02,210
a test and we would VPN we take our

948
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:06,910
internal system Brown on site and then

949
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:09,950
VPN to our tests network right and I

950
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:13,399
mean number one I did a port scan and I

951
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:16,129
crashed their power grid because they

952
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:18,830
DLC running on every system in multiple

953
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:23,140
occasions which was disturbing but once

954
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:25,549
they fixed that I go they kept using a

955
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:27,980
hermetically sealed Network we have a

956
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:29,750
hermetically sealed Network and I'm like

957
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,690
wow it's almost like someone's stage

958
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:36,830
right and I go that it's not possible

959
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:39,560
yes yes it is I go I'm in New York my

960
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:41,900
laptop is in Europe office or in your

961
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:45,049
data center and I'm connecting to it in

962
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:48,950
st. Louis at our test facility well

963
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:50,840
that's the exception okay I'm glad you

964
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:54,589
brought that term up can you send me a

965
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:57,380
list of all your exceptions they lost

966
00:50:54,590 --> 00:51:01,790
track it like 200 okay and it was emails

967
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:06,590
flowing back and forth it was it was you

968
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:08,360
know it was it was incredible it's going

969
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:10,750
to happen keep track of them don't hide

970
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,750
your dirt

971
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:18,600
all right now I had to put Milton up

972
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:21,540
here because today I'm like what is the

973
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,610
worst company you could work for yeah I

974
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:26,759
think I got it

975
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:29,310
IOT quarter provides loans for medical

976
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:32,160
procedures operates in North America and

977
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:35,640
Europe publicly-traded the customer

978
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:43,670
portal takes credit card payments okay

979
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:48,000
HIPAA PCI FFIEC sarbanes-oxley G RDP and

980
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:51,780
God knows what else that's what their

981
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,880
security group looks like okay be

982
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:57,720
thankful for your security company look

983
00:51:53,880 --> 00:52:00,990
for your security job let's look at how

984
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:03,180
they do policy this is their data

985
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:05,910
security policy again I'll give this to

986
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:07,259
people I'm gonna kind of read it I try

987
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:09,000
not to do a lot of words but when you're

988
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:11,160
talking about policy having one word up

989
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:16,200
there just doesn't work you know hashtag

990
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:18,299
good read the entire policy to ensure

991
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,950
that all of IOT see corpse data is

992
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,840
handled with appropriate care data

993
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:23,339
security program will be established

994
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,810
this is a the security program is

995
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:27,780
responsible for ensuring the

996
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:32,570
classification and handling of all data

997
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:35,010
no matter the form policy diamond

998
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:37,410
we got one done should we just do

999
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:43,260
everybody's policies in the next ten

1000
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:45,000
minutes I think we can do it identify

1001
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:47,220
owner the policy our chief information

1002
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,020
office will be responsible for the

1003
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:50,970
establishment and guidance of the data

1004
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:56,040
security program they're the ones that

1005
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:58,259
are accountable to the business unit the

1006
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,850
InfoSec team will verify compliance to

1007
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:02,250
this policy through various methods

1008
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:03,569
including to but not limited to business

1009
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:06,440
tool reports internal and external

1010
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:09,300
audits and feedback to the policy owner

1011
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:12,320
any exceptions to this policy must be

1012
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,890
approved by the InfoSec team in advance

1013
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,500
never happens

1014
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:18,810
non-compliance an employee found to have

1015
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,530
violated this policy may be subject to

1016
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:21,930
discipline

1017
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:25,580
disciplinary actions up to an including

1018
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:29,339
termination of employment policy done

1019
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:32,340
board can understand it it's approved

1020
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:36,030
this data security program will be

1021
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:39,570
relevant in 2019 2020 nine twenty five

1022
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:46,140
twenty five it doesn't change

1023
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:49,110
strategic planning easy now we start to

1024
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:50,970
get into the standards that's where it

1025
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:52,920
gets we start getting a lot more

1026
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:54,870
detailed now we said that we're going to

1027
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,790
classify I'm going to have a data

1028
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:59,370
classification standard I actually

1029
00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:02,550
copied and pasted parameters data

1030
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:02,940
security standard to explain how we do

1031
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:05,880
this

1032
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:08,520
well the other standards that hold this

1033
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,710
up encryption standard backup standard

1034
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:15,030
permission standards you may have all

1035
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:17,370
these other standards right now to give

1036
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:20,010
you an idea for example of data

1037
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:21,870
classification we talked about what

1038
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:26,520
classification is and I will give this

1039
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:28,560
to anybody by the way one of the biggest

1040
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:30,780
fights I have with PCI every year and we

1041
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:33,720
got D listed for four weeks because I

1042
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:36,140
would not go against this is they go why

1043
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:39,270
do you not have a copy of all of your

1044
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:42,480
clients policies because that's a

1045
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:46,080
security risk if I know your PlayBook I

1046
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:48,510
know how to bypass I can find weaknesses

1047
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:50,910
in your armor I don't want to hold on to

1048
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:52,590
that and I have a few clients out here

1049
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:56,670
that actually do vendor due diligence

1050
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:59,820
and they'll they can tell you I go you

1051
00:54:56,670 --> 00:55:01,230
can see it you're not getting it I'm not

1052
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,780
gonna do business with you if that's a

1053
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:04,770
requirement and we've turned it down

1054
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:06,870
fortunately a lot of those companies go

1055
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:10,440
we get it that's probably a good idea

1056
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:12,810
they come on site we have fun we joke we

1057
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:17,910
look at policy we go eat that's a good

1058
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:19,740
time right don't give it away we start

1059
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:24,330
talking about the differences between

1060
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:26,970
the the data so our first in parameter

1061
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:29,020
our most secure information is called

1062
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:32,618
confidential client data

1063
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:35,500
PhIP IIC HD audit information and

1064
00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:38,770
forensic information confidential

1065
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:42,010
whether oral recorded in any form or any

1066
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:44,140
medium that is created by health care is

1067
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:48,820
considered customer information by a

1068
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:53,740
bank is considered PII or cardholder

1069
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:57,070
data it all falls under that and based

1070
00:55:53,740 --> 00:56:00,029
on that there are certain security

1071
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:03,880
things that we need to deal with

1072
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:10,330
sensitive client data this may be your

1073
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:13,390
contracts with us your NDA's right it's

1074
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:15,130
stuff that we still hold in the high

1075
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:17,350
regard but it's not the highest regard

1076
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:18,610
this is more about my business at this

1077
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:20,710
point right

1078
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:24,670
we don't say your name as a client

1079
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:28,930
unless you ask us to or let us and a lot

1080
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:30,970
of you do which we think so for example

1081
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:32,710
we start to say stuff like in our

1082
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:35,950
standard it must be sent through

1083
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:41,050
encrypted means only to authorized

1084
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:44,618
recipients recipients then we start to

1085
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:49,660
even further confidential information

1086
00:56:44,619 --> 00:56:52,240
this is this this is our policies our

1087
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:55,480
procedures this is our workflow this is

1088
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:58,689
this is stuff that we do as a company to

1089
00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:02,080
ensure that we remain competitive it's

1090
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:04,290
for parameterize only for me to show you

1091
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:09,730
this I had to get permission from the

1092
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:14,190
our information officer me and I wrote

1093
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:16,600
and change the policy to allow that and

1094
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:18,400
then we start talking about internal

1095
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:21,460
information finally public information

1096
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:24,580
now couple things here you notice I'm

1097
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:27,850
not just dealing with pH I I'm not just

1098
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:31,390
dealing with PII we are information

1099
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:34,020
security professionals we deal with all

1100
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:36,819
information we classify all information

1101
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:39,190
even unclassified informations of

1102
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:41,530
classification I did a class for the

1103
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:43,690
Department of State and some dudes head

1104
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:45,400
blew when I made that statement he's

1105
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:47,440
like it's unclassified I go that's a

1106
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:50,710
classification because that's impossible

1107
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:55,030
no it's a classification was like who's

1108
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:57,460
on first 15 minutes but we need to talk

1109
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:59,350
about how it works because this is how

1110
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:03,930
the entire organization works with the

1111
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:03,930
information and I've covered everything

1112
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:09,040
now we talked about encryption standards

1113
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:11,710
but we may have sub standards in here

1114
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:13,750
that doesn't do the right word it just

1115
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:16,420
keeps coming out it's not substandard

1116
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:20,530
but you know it's mini standards so it's

1117
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:25,000
B it's more its sub standards categories

1118
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:26,110
there you go Mike file servers for Linux

1119
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,670
this is how we're going to do encryption

1120
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:28,990
on Linux servers that's how we're going

1121
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:32,740
to do Windows this is how we're going to

1122
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:35,830
deal with email okay we start to go

1123
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:39,009
through to that area now when we get

1124
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:42,370
down to our procedures our procedures

1125
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:45,460
then for example email encryption we may

1126
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:48,420
have a procedure on generating the

1127
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:51,340
certificates outlet plug-in installation

1128
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:53,800
sending encrypted email those are three

1129
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:56,430
different groups that are following the

1130
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:59,440
same standard right we have our PKI

1131
00:58:56,430 --> 00:59:03,129
group we have our desktop group and we

1132
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,360
have our end users we better need to

1133
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:06,580
make sure that they're following the

1134
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:09,940
same standard if you have it all in the

1135
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:11,500
same policy it's a policy for IT and

1136
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:16,000
it's probably for your server you're not

1137
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:19,600
hitting everything this is the other

1138
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,730
reason why I said we're Information

1139
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:28,180
Security and if you notice I put in

1140
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:31,210
there of any form how do you handle pH I

1141
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:34,690
once it's printed how do you handle

1142
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:38,050
cardholder data once it's printed once

1143
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:41,560
it's on USB once it's left somewhere

1144
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:44,590
well we say that we destroy it okay do

1145
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:47,560
you actually dictate what kind of lock

1146
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:49,690
it needs to be behind do you dictate

1147
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:53,230
what brand or what type of paper

1148
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:54,640
shredder you use your information

1149
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:57,820
security professionals

1150
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:00,089
I mean it's information but we deal with

1151
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:03,070
computers because we're computer people

1152
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:07,090
we can't do that this is organizational

1153
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:09,670
wide as well the standards for the

1154
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:10,540
accounting department and how they

1155
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:12,790
handle it

1156
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:15,640
will be different than yours but they

1157
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:18,670
need to handle it too so we need to make

1158
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:21,390
sure that we have these policies that

1159
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:23,830
stand alone

1160
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:32,350
now one of the problems you will run

1161
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:35,890
into here is is this gets confusing

1162
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:37,779
really quick so what we need is you need

1163
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:40,540
a GRC tool raise your hand if you have a

1164
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:42,750
GRC tool yeah see most people don't

1165
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:44,800
you're still using paper

1166
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:45,400
okay I'm line just a little bit behind

1167
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,580
here

1168
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:50,670
of course you start looking at GRC tools

1169
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:55,720
and you're gonna start price tag about

1170
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:58,360
$100,000 Oh your PCI 50,000 we launch VC

1171
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:00,009
so and one of our things last year and

1172
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:02,110
it was for the smaller mid-sized

1173
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:03,460
companies to go in and say okay you're

1174
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:06,910
gonna spend a hundred thousand dollars

1175
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:08,680
to sort everything out is expensive I'm

1176
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:12,339
a partner just full disclosure with an

1177
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:15,040
abra and they're actually open source

1178
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:16,600
created by GRC professionals but this

1179
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,940
holds your policies this holds your

1180
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:20,589
standards this lets you do data flow

1181
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:23,260
analysis it will actually be

1182
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:27,100
company-wide and it will actually allow

1183
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:30,760
the right people to have be able to

1184
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:33,069
create the right standards policies and

1185
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:38,920
it allows your security group to look it

1186
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:40,600
over and it's cheap ok the good job the

1187
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:43,600
good tool is the one that does the job

1188
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:46,990
for you and right now none of you have a

1189
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:50,020
tool you're using Microsoft Word you're

1190
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:52,240
using Excel spreadsheet I've actually

1191
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:54,070
gotten spreadsheet before PowerPoint who

1192
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:58,750
knows a wiki

1193
01:01:54,070 --> 01:02:01,930
this is going to be much better once you

1194
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:04,069
get through your basics of policy the

1195
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:06,288
world opens up to you you

1196
01:02:04,069 --> 01:02:08,719
new data flow analysis that is take a

1197
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:11,209
piece of data from creation to the

1198
01:02:08,719 --> 01:02:13,729
endpoint and look at every single aspect

1199
01:02:11,209 --> 01:02:15,618
where it touches and make sure that

1200
01:02:13,729 --> 01:02:18,049
there is the appropriate policy and

1201
01:02:15,619 --> 01:02:19,940
standard in place that meets the

1202
01:02:18,049 --> 01:02:24,920
requirements of that data classification

1203
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:26,779
it's easy it's great enterprise wide

1204
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,719
vendor due diligence right now only your

1205
01:02:26,779 --> 01:02:31,819
IT departments doing due diligence a

1206
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:34,180
good GRC tool and once you get this up

1207
01:02:31,819 --> 01:02:36,288
you've identified enterprise wide

1208
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:38,868
vendors and you can make sure they're

1209
01:02:36,289 --> 01:02:42,199
all meeting it PKI analysis are you

1210
01:02:38,869 --> 01:02:46,400
actually meeting your goals historical

1211
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:48,769
tracking where have we historically had

1212
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,900
issues where have we been good where

1213
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:54,828
where do we need to focus our attention

1214
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:57,440
to and we're in the future where can we

1215
01:02:54,829 --> 01:02:59,959
anticipate problems you should budget

1216
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:04,670
for failures because it's going to

1217
01:02:59,959 --> 01:03:06,919
happen no final thoughts here again

1218
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:10,009
policies is nothing more than

1219
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:10,670
documentation of how you do your

1220
01:03:10,009 --> 01:03:13,549
business

1221
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:20,420
none are the same and they should

1222
01:03:13,549 --> 01:03:22,640
support your business avoid legalese you

1223
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:24,799
don't work with a bunch of lawyers one

1224
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:28,308
of my web testers is still a lawyer and

1225
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:31,549
he hates legalese ok you want to be

1226
01:03:28,309 --> 01:03:34,430
clear and concise for everyone just

1227
01:03:31,549 --> 01:03:37,339
plain words and don't make it a book the

1228
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:40,269
thud factor is not impressive when it

1229
01:03:37,339 --> 01:03:43,788
comes to policy business units are

1230
01:03:40,269 --> 01:03:46,339
responsible for the creation the funding

1231
01:03:43,789 --> 01:03:50,059
the enforcement and the oversight of

1232
01:03:46,339 --> 01:03:53,239
these policies subject mayor experts

1233
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:59,630
write the procedures one final story

1234
01:03:53,239 --> 01:04:01,339
here I had a client they were showing me

1235
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:05,319
their procedures and their standards

1236
01:04:01,339 --> 01:04:09,140
every year they did firewall checks

1237
01:04:05,319 --> 01:04:12,019
firewall rule checks monthly that's what

1238
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:13,819
their policy person said I said ok so I

1239
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:17,189
went to their network your mistress

1240
01:04:13,819 --> 01:04:19,829
often do you check firewall rules

1241
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:24,210
orderly yeah can you do it monthly no

1242
01:04:19,829 --> 01:04:27,180
that's insane policy says so they don't

1243
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:30,420
know what we're talking about there's a

1244
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:35,430
problem right they fix that and finally

1245
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:38,579
document document document this right

1246
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:41,129
here is awesome but if it's in here no

1247
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:46,980
one else can follow it and if this goes

1248
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:48,540
away so does everything else I don't

1249
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:50,869
have any time for any questions but

1250
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:50,869
thank you
