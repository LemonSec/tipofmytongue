1
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:30,549
does anybody have a flask asking for a

2
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,550
friend

3
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:40,280
no judgment whiskey vodka tequila then

4
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:48,199
if you have beer and a flask

5
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:58,519
I need your man card like okay you're on

6
00:00:48,200 --> 00:01:02,120
probation alright so next speaker up

7
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:06,860
here is a self-proclaimed

8
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:09,500
still communicated hold that's exciting

9
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,700
who wrote that come on Ben chill it I'm

10
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,460
Chuck

11
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:16,750
he's got a talk here on hacking your

12
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,750
life Hudson Harris

13
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:31,229
you go that was the best okay it's the

14
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,350
futures are brought horizon that was a

15
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,790
great introduction thank you I am I was

16
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,140
just saying that I always find it these

17
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,970
conferences people talk a lot about

18
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,940
themselves and I find that nobody really

19
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,740
cares if I was supposed to convince you

20
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:47,070
to be here it's either too late or we

21
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,259
already did it so my name is Hudson

22
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,509
Harris and I'm gonna talk to you today

23
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:54,060
about human centered design and hacking

24
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:56,790
your life when I originally talked to

25
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,610
Dave and damn Yarger about this talk

26
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,280
there's kind of two different tracks one

27
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,190
would be useful professionally one would

28
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,200
be useful personally so instead of

29
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,699
picking I decided to do both so we're

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,209
gonna kind of have both kind of blend in

31
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:14,760
and out and I have a question who here

32
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:17,010
has heard of human centered design a few

33
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,429
hands one two three five ten oh good we

34
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,019
got a good room humans that our design

35
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,390
is something that is starting to gain a

36
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,730
whole lot more steam if I had to compare

37
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,440
it to something I think black belt Six

38
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,579
Sigma stuff like that back in the day is

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,989
going to be somewhat similar to the

40
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,200
human Center design stuff in the next

41
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:36,030
four or five years a lot of the human

42
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,950
Center design aspect just comes from a

43
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,110
design process so how are you building

44
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,810
solutions for people how are you

45
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:46,769
building solutions for problems and then

46
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,750
a process around what to really pull out

47
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:51,330
of that to give yourself the biggest

48
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,440
chances of success some of the really

49
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,900
really big human centered design

50
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,549
projects that we'll talk about have had

51
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,860
some really neat breakthroughs and kind

52
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:02,310
of really neat ways of cross platforming

53
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:05,700
and moving things around where we're

54
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:09,209
gonna start is right in the meat of it

55
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:13,079
so this at a very high level is the

56
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:14,310
human centered design cycle where you

57
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,260
would use this if you were designing

58
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,350
software if you're designing an actual

59
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,019
product if you were designing even even

60
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,340
things like offices it's been used

61
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:25,799
across the planet in a whole bunch of

62
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,600
different ways but the whole system is

63
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,099
really built on these four steps define

64
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,780
id8 proto

65
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,189
and iterate and I always have to turn

66
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,689
around and look at those because I

67
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:36,719
stumble and trip and can't remember

68
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:39,299
which one it is but the whole idea here

69
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,799
is that you don't just do in the

70
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,969
direction you don't just code in a

71
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,590
direction you don't just develop a

72
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:44,939
product in a direction so pretty

73
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,500
familiar with that phrase I could do

74
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:48,090
something in the direction like work

75
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,829
hard not smart like that kind of thing

76
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,670
so we're just gonna start coding instead

77
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:55,290
of designing mapping building and what

78
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,809
you'll find is is that as we go through

79
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,340
this process these things become really

80
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,079
self-evident and it's really something

81
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,150
to take at a really really basic level

82
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:07,620
to what you do every single day so

83
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:09,599
somebody says here's a project I always

84
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,689
start with framing the problem I always

85
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,069
go to say what am I trying to do here

86
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:17,699
what am I actually trying to accomplish

87
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:20,459
here so what's an example of this I was

88
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:22,440
asked to come in on a big data project

89
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,840
to create an open data standard for

90
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,789
mental health to create a standard just

91
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,479
like we have with hl7 just like we have

92
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:32,639
with Ethernet cables the ISO standards

93
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,620
all those things most things in this

94
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,349
country have some type of standard of

95
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,699
how they translate and communicate open

96
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:41,550
data standards for mental health do not

97
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:44,159
so I was brought into this project I got

98
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,110
very very excited and I lost complete

99
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,990
sight of the problem that we were trying

100
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,550
to address I built out entire pathways I

101
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,750
built out networks like I had all this

102
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,889
stuff mapped out and things and

103
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,750
definitions stuff that I didn't actually

104
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:57,210
get down to the key issue which was what

105
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:00,020
was the problem we're trying to solve so

106
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:02,849
what what we do in this in this step is

107
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,500
and I'm a big fan of visuals so I have

108
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:07,770
actual examples of things I've worked on

109
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,690
so is we define the problem here what

110
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:12,750
you'll see is it a really high level you

111
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,550
sit down with your entire team and color

112
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,039
code your post-it notes you're going to

113
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,440
need a lot of them but we color code

114
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,150
post-it notes and sometimes the color

115
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,340
coding I think on this one these were

116
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,780
different people had different colors so

117
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,060
that you could match in track as it goes

118
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,630
through but what we did is we really

119
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,760
nailed down what are the exists

120
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,900
problems we're trying to go after so

121
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,659
that's right down here and their key

122
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:37,049
questions so as you go through this

123
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:40,060
process keep some things in mind

124
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:42,010
constraint is really really important

125
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:45,000
there been a whole lot of studies and

126
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:46,990
research recently that has validated the

127
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,370
hypothesis that when you have

128
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,740
environments with unlimited resources

129
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,050
the Google's the Facebook's all those

130
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,830
things you don't innovate the way that

131
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,140
scrappy

132
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:59,020
startups do so now there's entire

133
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:01,750
treatises on how to basically build

134
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,090
these scrappy little labs if you will

135
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:07,270
but some really easy way to put tight

136
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:09,070
constraints time so you don't want to

137
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,409
have unlimited time you don't want to

138
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,370
have unlimited resources and a lot of

139
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,990
times you don't even want to have

140
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,480
unlimited features so really you want to

141
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,120
define your problem set some constraints

142
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,430
and then start identifying all of your

143
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,750
you know I go with six your top six key

144
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,070
questions sometimes it's less sometimes

145
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:28,360
it's a little more six always seems to

146
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:32,770
just about hit the number but set the

147
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:35,500
limits materials time people resources

148
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,210
all of these things create an

149
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,430
environment where it forces our brains

150
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:41,710
to do the thing that we need to do which

151
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,360
is make the leap to bridge the two

152
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,280
places that our brain has been and what

153
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,260
we know and get to where we want to go

154
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,820
and what we want to do so one of the

155
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,620
things that I always do in this

156
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,210
situation when I'm trying to think big

157
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,010
and ask these questions and get these

158
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:56,229
activities and tools together is really

159
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:59,380
keep that in mind how am i bridging what

160
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:01,630
I'm doing and taking it elsewhere so

161
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,450
once you've identified all of your key

162
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,130
questions get to consensus so this is

163
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,840
not a convergence you're not trying to

164
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,100
boil them down you're just trying to

165
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,719
make sure that you've got them lined up

166
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,180
so if these are all questions about one

167
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,760
issue match them up and then what you

168
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,620
want to do is come up here and

169
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,210
activities tools and techniques so the

170
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,770
activities tools and techniques or all

171
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:25,060
the things that a lot of you are already

172
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:28,000
doing when you're designing malware or

173
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,320
pen testing things or other things that

174
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,439
make Ben shake his head that I don't

175
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,209
understand about

176
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,429
hacking and things but like all the

177
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:35,479
tools and things you use list those like

178
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:36,619
literally here's all the things we're

179
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:37,609
going to use here's all the equipment

180
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:38,839
we're gonna use here's everything that

181
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,389
we're gonna have and there's a reason

182
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:43,819
for this when you start to identify the

183
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:46,399
environment your brain starts to do

184
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:48,319
magical things where it starts to make a

185
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,639
bubble these are the things I have these

186
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,349
are the things I don't have this is what

187
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,209
I have to accomplish and you create an

188
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:55,399
environment that is literally spurring

189
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:57,739
innovation and new neuron connections in

190
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:58,909
your brain this is literally I'm using

191
00:07:57,739 --> 00:08:00,409
that word literally not by the

192
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:02,119
definition of the dictionary which is

193
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:03,679
figuratively but they're actually mapped

194
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:04,819
out neuron connections when this stuff

195
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:07,578
happens it's pretty amazing

196
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:09,529
so activities tools and techniques some

197
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:12,439
of the other ones that I really like is

198
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:13,879
is identifying really really big high

199
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:17,149
level things that you want to do so

200
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:18,860
system mapping whenever I work with my

201
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:22,759
clients I work a lot in mental health

202
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,979
technology product design go to market

203
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:26,509
stuff kind of in that area whenever we

204
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:28,399
do that I always start with the system

205
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:30,079
map whether it's a product whether it's

206
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,999
a service whether it's you know just

207
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,529
something we want to launch I create a

208
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,329
system map and the system app is really

209
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,438
just how's it going to be used who's

210
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:38,088
gonna use it where is it going to go

211
00:08:36,438 --> 00:08:39,259
what's gonna happen and what do we want

212
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:41,029
to have happen throughout that whole

213
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:43,759
cycle because then what you're doing

214
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:45,800
there is establishing the whole life

215
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,389
cycle of what you're trying to build so

216
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,040
then you build in these steps and what

217
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:52,399
you'll find is is you map do things like

218
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,930
system mapping it will actually create

219
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,459
new little bubbles in your brain around

220
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:59,779
these types of things have these issues

221
00:08:55,459 --> 00:09:04,479
in these problems so this is defining

222
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:08,029
the problem the next step is ID 8 ITA is

223
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:12,470
my most favorite next to prototyping my

224
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:13,579
most favorite phase but brainstorming is

225
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,149
something we've all heard of and is

226
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:16,839
really boring

227
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:18,980
like super boring nobody really actually

228
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:20,540
imes everybody knows what brainstorming

229
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,550
is but nobody really like wants to do it

230
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,990
it's just a buzzword so this is what I

231
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:27,378
encourage you to do when you get to the

232
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:30,709
brainstorming phase get ridiculous get

233
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:33,379
extreme go all the way to the opposite

234
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:35,420
ends of what you're trying to do to

235
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:39,860
figure out what you need and what's

236
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:41,149
happening so case in point I do is a

237
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,670
humongous human centered design

238
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:45,100
consulting firm

239
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:47,979
and they were brought in to make a new

240
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,120
kitchen gadget and I would bet that by

241
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,830
the time I get to the end of this story

242
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,330
most of you have used this kitchen

243
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,790
gadget and don't know how it was made

244
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:57,670
so this kitchen gadget was supposed to

245
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,020
drive vegetables and they had all sorts

246
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,189
of prototypes all sorts of different

247
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,900
things about how we're gonna design

248
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,510
vegetables and so the way they got

249
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,910
extreme is they said okay what's

250
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:11,410
everybody who could possibly use this on

251
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:14,860
one end professional michelin-star chef

252
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:17,319
on the other end a child four five years

253
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:20,200
old and in the middle line cook at a

254
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,720
restaurant or you know in a place like

255
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,400
this so the full spectrum because the

256
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,440
product was really meant just for the

257
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,850
middle but what they found was is is

258
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,100
that by going all the way out to the

259
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:34,420
extremes it opened up a whole new level

260
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:36,100
of design possibility for them the other

261
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,920
the other thing to keep in mind when we

262
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,150
are in the id8 stage is be divergent has

263
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,459
anybody ever done divergent

264
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,660
brainstorming or divergent ideation is

265
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,510
that ringing a bell at all

266
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,430
okay so who's been in the room where

267
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,610
there's a lot of ideas and one person

268
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:53,439
goes you know what that idea is the one

269
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:56,770
is that fun do we like that no nobody's

270
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,180
ever been in that room wake up wake up

271
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,710
has anybody ever been in a room where

272
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:04,449
somebody shut down the entire discussion

273
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:07,330
there we go that's convergent yeah this

274
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:09,070
one does all the time so does val/val is

275
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:12,040
our social hack dress if you've not ever

276
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,750
seen her speak she's very divergent when

277
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:18,430
it comes to how to hack people's lives

278
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:20,050
and nuclear facilities and banks here's

279
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,339
the idea behind divergent I want you to

280
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,750
think of things like a little branch

281
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,580
like a little tree you have a single

282
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,620
nugget of an idea and instead of

283
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,120
consolidating and refining it's not what

284
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,280
you're supposed to do here your time

285
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,290
limited half an hour 45 minutes hour or

286
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,720
whatever you want to put it on find that

287
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,459
nugget and grow it and get weird and get

288
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,350
different and get out there you want to

289
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,270
grow this side of the funnel the whole

290
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,790
idea is that you have a list of ideas

291
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:45,160
that quite literally look like the top

292
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,870
of a tree all the branches so you're

293
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,370
going to get on the extremes and you're

294
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,930
gonna be divergent and you're thinking

295
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:53,270
which is very different than what we do

296
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:55,130
today mostly to do today so

297
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:56,240
yes oh that was the other thing so one

298
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,480
of the other things that I like to do is

299
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,690
what's called a mash up and other shoes

300
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,930
storm so the mash up idea is where you

301
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:07,459
take questions problems and ideas that

302
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,649
have already happened and you put them

303
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:11,359
together figure out how do we take these

304
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:13,790
things that we know might be valuable or

305
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:18,560
good and mash them up the other ideas

306
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:20,360
storm is the impetus portion of this the

307
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,589
Impa thighs aspect of this is probably

308
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,820
one of the most critical and one of the

309
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:24,680
ones that a lot of people I think just

310
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:27,050
kind of gloss over but the way that

311
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:30,319
empathizing works in this situation is

312
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:33,050
you pretend literally that you're trying

313
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,029
to be the person who's going to use it

314
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,380
that you're trying to figure out exactly

315
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:40,279
what you're going to do so like when

316
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:42,380
they redesigned airplanes they did a

317
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:44,029
terrible job but the firm that was built

318
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,189
in to redesign the airplane seating for

319
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:49,040
Boeing literally brought in chairs and

320
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,390
limited their space and they lined up

321
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,219
the chairs in a hundred different

322
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,899
possible configurations they built bunk

323
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,920
beds they did standing they did all this

324
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:58,760
stuff some of my other favorite ones are

325
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,469
there was one where they were trying to

326
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,120
figure out a solution for arthritis and

327
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,980
what they did is they got those big

328
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,360
elastic bands at the gym and they tied

329
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,579
them around all of their joints and

330
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,920
taped them so they couldn't move and it

331
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:11,540
made it hard some of the ways for

332
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,979
mobility sitting into wheelchairs

333
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,329
opposed to be able to walk around to

334
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,370
understand what it's like to order a cup

335
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:19,279
of coffee at a coffee shop if you can't

336
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,779
stand up that's empathizing so whether

337
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,939
it's you're using something digitally

338
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:25,130
you're using something in the real world

339
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:27,410
but experience physical and digital the

340
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,880
three aspects of empathizing with an

341
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,709
individual and what you'll find is is

342
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,170
that by figuring out where to empathize

343
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,849
you get a whole lot closer to solving

344
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:37,640
the problems you've identified so this

345
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:40,310
is part of what ideated looks like as we

346
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:43,430
get there so up on the top

347
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:45,020
we still have all of the different

348
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,459
activities tools and techniques but now

349
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,680
what we've done is we put some different

350
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:50,390
ideas in there around models wireframes

351
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,339
tasks flows mock-ups workflows

352
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:54,110
everything that we wanted to have as a

353
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:56,750
part of it and now you see that the

354
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:58,160
questions have refined much down so

355
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,680
we've taken those questions we've

356
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,890
ideated different solutions and BIID

357
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,500
ating the solutions it's refined

358
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:07,000
because it's this whole CQI continuous

359
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,170
quality improvement loop every time

360
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,880
you're going to one question you're

361
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,339
going back and forward this whole time

362
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:17,730
this seems complex it gets really simple

363
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:21,010
and really fast all right here we go so

364
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,000
prototype prototype it's really really

365
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,370
fun has anybody ever done live

366
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,440
prototyping for product design or live

367
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,830
prototyping for system design or

368
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,030
anything it's a lot of fun like and

369
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,240
here's the whole thing about prototyping

370
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:36,970
I want to keep keep it keep in mind this

371
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,060
is quantity not quality these are very

372
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:42,070
rough and you want to keep it fun and

373
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,209
silly why do we want to keep it fun and

374
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:46,330
sell units and that's ridiculous for

375
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,560
professionals most the time your brain

376
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,510
works a lot better when it's laughing

377
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,510
your brain works a whole lot better when

378
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:55,630
you can get a friend to pose do

379
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:59,290
something like this I gave a challenge

380
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:00,550
to make a hat out of foil and make that

381
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,079
hat something that had never been done

382
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:05,199
before so my friend Nicole built a hat

383
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:08,290
out of foil cut some goggles and it was

384
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,450
I can't remember what it was for it was

385
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,530
just it was oh she was both on so this

386
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,900
her eyes wouldn't get hurt she had to

387
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:15,939
build this but really fast really simple

388
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,350
and I built one - that was way worse

389
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,170
that I'm not going to show because no

390
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,970
pictures survived but a prototype it out

391
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:25,170
and sometimes it's as simple as doing on

392
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:27,490
a programming side doing a clickable PDF

393
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,930
you can go and do some wireframes to

394
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,850
understand how things will go and flow

395
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:33,849
but it's really really critical at this

396
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,290
stage to not get perfectionist but keep

397
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,600
it really basic and low to the ground

398
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:40,209
I've seen prototypes as basic as a flip

399
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,340
book I've seen them as complex as like

400
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:45,340
almost demos where they had a sandbox

401
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:47,170
where they could build stuff live you

402
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,130
know some plate some places now like

403
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,510
some of the really big healthcare

404
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,939
companies that are doing a lot of this

405
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:53,860
stuff have actual garages in their

406
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:56,230
offices where people can go and innovate

407
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,400
product design for medical devices to

408
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,230
help people on the floor they've got

409
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,880
woodshop tools and metal shop tools and

410
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,320
all this kind of stuff this is what's

411
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,060
coming I think this is how this stuff is

412
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,820
going to go so think about how do you

413
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,619
prototype what you're trying to build

414
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,550
and I think that this is a step that a

415
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,870
lot of a lot of things Mis

416
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,160
I can't tell you that over times they've

417
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,690
been said okay so here's your budget and

418
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,610
here's your project okay go for it give

419
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:19,700
us a plan okay now deliver it it's a

420
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:21,290
really really really bad way to develop

421
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,850
something because you're always gonna

422
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:25,160
get something that you've either already

423
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,880
done or is just a little bit different

424
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,339
than what you've done

425
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:31,010
prototyping forces you to get out of

426
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:33,740
that it forces you to say where are my

427
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,189
extremes what's happening what am i

428
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,529
doing

429
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:40,459
so this is what's fun about prototyping

430
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:43,010
the prototyping of the kitchen tool

431
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:45,199
before what they found was is is that

432
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,790
you needed to drive vegetables going

433
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,500
back like we're literally talking about

434
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,089
drying vegetables this is pretty cool is

435
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,170
anybody laughing yet no we're a little

436
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:54,709
tired and the better we get a little

437
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:56,839
chuckle I like that back to drying

438
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:58,130
vegetables so what they found was is to

439
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:59,959
had some key elements they really needed

440
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,390
to hit it had to be easy had to be

441
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:04,698
easily graspable had to really spin it

442
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:07,129
fast anybody picking up where this is

443
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:08,630
going and what they found was is is that

444
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,600
someone said well what's a really easy

445
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:13,760
gesture for a kid to make let's do the

446
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,669
lawn mower and that's how the salad

447
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,290
spinner was born so they found that they

448
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,819
wanted to spend a basket they knew they

449
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:22,129
needed something that was easy and easy

450
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:23,300
to work on both ends of the extremes but

451
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,760
literally they made something that

452
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,839
served the entire spectrum and I'm not

453
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,790
gonna ask you to raise your hands cuz

454
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,470
nobody will but I bet everyone in here

455
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:33,139
has a salad spinner or is given one at a

456
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:35,840
whet thank you thank you and you and Ben

457
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:38,809
and Val thank you my four people about

458
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,370
their holding the flame but it really is

459
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,540
important because that wouldn't have

460
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,639
happened they wouldn't have gotten their

461
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,889
that innovation around what makes it

462
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,500
easy to do and what solves those

463
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,790
problems was really freaking cool and

464
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,630
now it's literally a product that's

465
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:59,480
absolutely everywhere so the last one is

466
00:17:53,630 --> 00:18:00,860
similar to prototyping I think this just

467
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,150
disconnected oh there it is okay yeah

468
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:07,100
similar to prototyping it's iteration

469
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:09,260
iteration is where you've decided on a

470
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,360
prototype we have picked that we are

471
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,429
going to do this one thing we are going

472
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,590
to pick this solution this prototype

473
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:17,300
that solves the problems that hits the

474
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,990
mark that does we want to do and now you

475
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,120
beat the crap out of it

476
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,279
you absolutely go through it and you are

477
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,309
giving it to multiple different teams

478
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,360
and you're saying break it build it

479
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:28,678
rebuild it

480
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,629
make it happen figure out how it's going

481
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,279
to work and again remember we're time

482
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,140
constraint I've seen design sessions go

483
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,940
through this entire process in two hours

484
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,830
for products that are now on the shelves

485
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,020
like they can go fast again that time

486
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:42,449
constraint is really key but as you're

487
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,980
going through three words because I'm

488
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,399
really big on takeaways three words

489
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:49,409
desirability feasibility viability

490
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:51,059
desirability do I want the thing is it

491
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:51,809
something that I would want to have is

492
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:54,750
it something that I would like to

493
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:59,549
actually be in my kitchen on my desk

494
00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:02,070
whatever it might be and feasibility is

495
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:04,080
it something that feasibly could be

496
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:05,820
mass-produced could be mass scaled is

497
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,070
that something that feasibly actually

498
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,689
just makes business sense it's like the

499
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,580
gut check this makes sense that we're

500
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:15,270
doing this and then the last one is

501
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:17,129
viability viability is can it go to

502
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,799
market an in viability stage you can do

503
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:22,049
things like I like tech storms are a way

504
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:23,610
to do viability checks you can have a

505
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:25,139
group of friends so you can say hey what

506
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,100
do you guys think of this and then

507
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,539
they're gonna say it's terrible that's

508
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,279
great that's good I'm actually a really

509
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:32,549
big fan of text messaging as a way to

510
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:34,710
design because you get that instant

511
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:36,809
reaction you get the gut feeling about

512
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,909
it because we've all been in those

513
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:40,649
situations where we felt something or

514
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:43,740
we've seen something or we've done

515
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:46,080
something that really didn't the design

516
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:49,830
didn't feel right does anybody ever hear

517
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,168
about the the ejection seats in World

518
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,580
War two that problem to keep the first

519
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:55,710
human centered design problems anybody

520
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,870
hear about that okay so yeah I have one

521
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:00,120
hand in the back it was quiet and I

522
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:03,360
liked them we got you perfect so here's

523
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:08,189
what happened they designed a plane that

524
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:10,590
had an ejection pole right here and they

525
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:13,500
had a lot of ejection poles do you want

526
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:16,230
to know what is also right here the

527
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,789
stick so they were having a whole lot of

528
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,500
ejection poles and even worse when

529
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:20,910
people were really getting really having

530
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,650
problems they would go to the wrong area

531
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,030
because they weren't really thinking

532
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,530
through and doing this whole process

533
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,120
what are we trying to do we're trying to

534
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,879
make something that is an easy way to

535
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,260
get out of the plane solve those

536
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,200
problems and think them through and then

537
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,730
if they had prototyped and iterated they

538
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,260
would have figured it out that it wasn't

539
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,370
natural to try and reach here that if

540
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,629
something was going on you needed

541
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,580
something over here that was out of the

542
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,930
way and a much more secure way that was

543
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,580
one of the first instances of the

544
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:49,530
military getting into human centered

545
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:52,740
design so the last one is the fail fast

546
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:57,180
and fail for it as part of iterate this

547
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:59,220
is often the hardest one there's no in

548
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:03,420
this process everybody basically has to

549
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:05,100
agree to check their egos at the door it

550
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,870
will only kill the process and if you

551
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,360
have people in that room that are

552
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:11,070
killing the process politely ask them to

553
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,260
leave schedule them to other meetings

554
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:15,720
they have to go to like you need to have

555
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,100
this environment and I know that this is

556
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,680
like a trigger for some people but a

557
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,820
safe space because you do everybody's

558
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,020
gotta be able to talk everybody's gotta

559
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,340
build to get their ideas in because

560
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:26,160
that's one of the other things one

561
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:30,030
speaker at a time per team if people are

562
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,830
talking over it just doesn't get done

563
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:34,020
nothing happens so then you have this

564
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:37,340
fail fast fail forward the fill fast

565
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:39,600
fail forward is there are no bad designs

566
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:42,510
you're just learning every time it

567
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,310
happens that's what I tell my kids there

568
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,990
are bad designs are terribly bad designs

569
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,100
and if you get to this point and it is

570
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,450
bad and it doesn't work

571
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,889
look you just go right back up you've

572
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,180
already defined the problem you've

573
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,740
already ideated and you probably have

574
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,810
some prototypes you can go back to and

575
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,640
you just repeat the cycle that's the

576
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:58,560
beauty of this is that this process is

577
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,830
self-sustaining as you develop and build

578
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:04,110
through these things and then the last

579
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,129
one is converge ideas so this is what

580
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,409
we're going the other direction now

581
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:09,330
instead of the big hand of all the ideas

582
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,340
out we want to go what we're all used to

583
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,540
which is the funnel end so we want to

584
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,209
come back here during the iteration

585
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,370
phase we want to look at the frame of

586
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,420
the frame of the question and the

587
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,040
problems we want to look at the

588
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:23,430
ideations the prototypes and we want to

589
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:25,320
converge down and get to this last

590
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:27,660
iteration stage we want to get to

591
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,399
okay now go test it in the market go get

592
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,710
a focus group together go get something

593
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,710
that's going out there but that

594
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:34,909
vergence is scary it's really scary

595
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,500
because all of a sudden people have to

596
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:39,409
let go of ideas and when people get

597
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,909
emotionally attached ideas one or two

598
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:43,399
things happen if they use those ideas

599
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:45,080
everybody loves them oh my god like oh

600
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:46,699
my god it's my idea it's just so great I

601
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,199
absolutely can't believe this is my idea

602
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,929
and then when they don't use your idea

603
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,450
it's terrible and it's so bad and it

604
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:54,919
makes you feel bad but the really cool

605
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,870
part about this process is is that when

606
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:59,059
you converge when you go through these

607
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:00,620
ideation things everybody gets a little

608
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:03,139
piece of all the ideas that end up where

609
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,178
you're going so this is also a tool to

610
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,740
effectively have group work where

611
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:08,059
everybody contributes and everybody

612
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,529
feels like they've got a little piece of

613
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:12,139
the pie and a little bit of buy-in and

614
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:14,750
then close the process and then that

615
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:18,409
process is done document it like I

616
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:20,630
showed you guys the pictures not Nicole

617
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:22,580
there show JZ pictures I take pictures

618
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:24,320
of all these boards and then when you

619
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,760
come back you can get back and say all

620
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,350
right well we saw this or we did this or

621
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,789
whatever you move it around it gets a

622
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:30,230
lot better because that documentation of

623
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:31,309
the process then becomes your project

624
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,539
brief and they don't have to write

625
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,770
anything else you just have pictures of

626
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:35,840
all the boards where your stickies are

627
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:38,990
some people get really complex and like

628
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,928
I'm cool with it like yellow is ideas

629
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:43,220
and blue is analysis and red is to do's

630
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:44,659
and there's all these different like

631
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,190
schemes you can find online they're all

632
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:48,470
great if they work I'm a big fan of

633
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,360
simple I wanted a simple as humanly

634
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:55,490
possible so that we can get to what we

635
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:58,580
need to do all right so before I move on

636
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:59,990
does anybody have any questions I'm

637
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,080
gonna go into the personal stuff if

638
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:08,120
anybody else wants to leave okay all

639
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:10,939
right so you guys ready we're gonna do

640
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:14,090
this salad show me con not even a

641
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:17,559
chuckle really that's one of my best

642
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:19,668
memes okay well I got one all right so

643
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:21,830
some of you may or may not know me my

644
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:23,960
first talk at a conference was four

645
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:25,490
years ago is show me con Dave and Renae

646
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,440
gave me my first shot to speak at a

647
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:30,390
conference why did I want to speak at a

648
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,370
conference I wanted to design it

649
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:34,050
better life I mean to be perfectly

650
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,000
honest like I was miserable I wasn't

651
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:37,860
happy with what I was doing but I also

652
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,400
didn't see a way out and so I created a

653
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,209
plan

654
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,280
literally developed a step-by-step plan

655
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:45,800
that at least I can in hindsight say

656
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,120
followed some of these same principles

657
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,440
but it was it was a whole plan around

658
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,000
how to do this and what to do this and

659
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,560
so this is this part of the talk is how

660
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,570
do i tackle these personal issues

661
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,580
because at the end of the day the stuff

662
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:58,320
that we're doing in work so if we're

663
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,520
doing at home you know my adage is

664
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,620
always how you spend your day is how you

665
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,660
spend your life so if you're trying to

666
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,709
develop better stuff at home and in your

667
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,480
life you're trying to develop better

668
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,770
stuff at work all of this stuff flows in

669
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,270
and out of itself and works really well

670
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,620
and I will tell you the more that I've

671
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,629
gotten on board with like how I'm

672
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:15,389
thinking in these processes the better

673
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:16,380
my work output and product has been and

674
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,360
I've gotten a whole lot better at

675
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:23,790
working smart even if I haven't gotten

676
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:25,530
better at meme selection apparently okay

677
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:27,649
so here was my problem

678
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:31,560
I'll just put myself out there for this

679
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:33,930
struggling with mental illness working

680
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:36,450
with a wife who was also struggling with

681
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:38,850
mental illness had one kid another one

682
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:40,590
on the way September yeah no we already

683
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:43,129
had him six months old he was their

684
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:45,810
high-risk pregnancy

685
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:47,340
unbelievable amounts of stress I mean I

686
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,540
just I I look back at that time of my

687
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,709
life and it's hard to even really

688
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:53,940
comprehend how I didn't just fall apart

689
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,480
but what I did is I said what's my

690
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,670
problem

691
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,020
what's the specific problem I have a lot

692
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:00,480
of problems what's the specific problem

693
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,980
that I want to solve I wanted to be able

694
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,140
to come to conferences like this I

695
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,180
wanted to be able to write I think the

696
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:09,570
buzzword is thought leader which is just

697
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:11,310
oh but what I really wanted to do was

698
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,480
help I want to help people learn I

699
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,800
wanted to come out and teach like has

700
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,200
anybody ever seen one of my other talks

701
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,300
on HIPAA I had wrath of the audits that

702
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,370
was well okay one of my favorites wrath

703
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,980
of the audits I did D&D HIPPA that one

704
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:25,350
was a lot of fun some privacy stuff we

705
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,940
did a panel a couple years ago but my

706
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,679
whole idea was is is that what I wanted

707
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,510
to do was take complex things and make

708
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,270
them simple for people and then have

709
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:36,720
them pay me to do that so I've done the

710
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:40,059
first two steps of that I'm working on

711
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,609
that third one although I did get a

712
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:45,039
give a talk at Capital One Mortgage

713
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:46,478
something something something which was

714
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,529
definitely one of the weirdest I mean it

715
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:49,359
was just I have no idea how they found

716
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:51,249
my name but they paid me 500 dollars to

717
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,080
come talk to about privacy journey

718
00:26:51,249 --> 00:26:55,299
people showed up there's amazing three

719
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,189
oh my god

720
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:59,109
it was incredible like it was such a

721
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:01,179
wake up in all the 5,000 person

722
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:02,468
conference three people in the room like

723
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:06,969
we just sat at the table and talked

724
00:27:02,469 --> 00:27:09,580
about privacy it was really intimate but

725
00:27:06,969 --> 00:27:10,869
my whole idea was how do we actually how

726
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:14,199
do I actually do something that works

727
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:16,029
because oh my god it's so overwhelming I

728
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,919
think I'm not like the problems I'm

729
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:22,210
facing even now I just left my last job

730
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,580
just moved out to California

731
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:27,759
I still have both kids and my wife

732
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:31,269
thankfully my geriatric dog is still

733
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:33,429
hanging on and I know what I'm gonna do

734
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:35,349
tomorrow but it's so overwhelming

735
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:37,029
because that's we're just taught that

736
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:38,710
when it's overwhelming if we just hide

737
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:40,839
from it compartmentalize it and cope it

738
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:45,279
out that's why this was funny

739
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:47,918
this one it's funny you're all gonna

740
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,299
laugh at that by the end I promise but

741
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,499
that's a whole thing we're taught to

742
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:51,249
actually avoid that we don't want

743
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:52,629
to do it it's big you know we're

744
00:27:51,249 --> 00:27:56,619
whelming its problem okay so here I was

745
00:27:52,629 --> 00:28:00,519
I had the education I had friends like

746
00:27:56,619 --> 00:28:03,639
Dave and I had the will so I created a

747
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:06,339
plan I knew where I wanted to go I

748
00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:09,668
wanted to talk in a big honkin

749
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:12,190
conference I wanted people to get value

750
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:14,349
out of what that was so I put a goal 18

751
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,879
months out from that and then I said how

752
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:17,799
do I get there and all I did was I just

753
00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:18,939
looked I just figured out I don't have

754
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:20,289
the credibility because I haven't

755
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,519
written I don't know the credibility

756
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:23,259
because I haven't given talks and

757
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:26,769
they're credibly Simon I've written a

758
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:28,839
book so let's start and so I set a goal

759
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:30,519
I was gonna write two articles every two

760
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:31,749
weeks and then I was just gonna start

761
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:35,589
trying to find people to publish them

762
00:28:31,749 --> 00:28:39,879
and nobody did really fast nobody did it

763
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:41,499
was great so I got my own website and I

764
00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:42,639
started posting my own blogs there and

765
00:28:41,499 --> 00:28:44,530
then I started getting all sorts of

766
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:47,139
Russian BOTS linking to it

767
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:48,700
and then I started to get people that

768
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:51,430
wanted to talk and they wanted to hear

769
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:53,530
from me trip wire I was a contributing

770
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,730
author on trip wire state of security

771
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:56,879
for a long time until they realized that

772
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:59,320
I don't know anything about security and

773
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,730
I still don't get that one but they were

774
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,379
they gave me my first shot it was great

775
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:04,090
and I love them and I give all the love

776
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,980
I can to them but but truly I just

777
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,360
started but I had a plan

778
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,430
it was literally written out you guys

779
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,250
like I'm going to do this and I set

780
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:13,480
goals and I had a visual calendar this

781
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,060
is what I wanted so then I said alright

782
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,130
I need to get extreme' if you ever heard

783
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:20,260
of the freight of the acronym be hag I

784
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:24,070
hate it I hate it sounds but I love what

785
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:26,200
it means big hairy audacious goal okay

786
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:27,820
that's my extremes I wanted to get out

787
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,260
there I wanted to get out there on a big

788
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,389
stage right

789
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:33,010
so I set those goals and then I backed

790
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:34,780
into it and this is how I do all of my

791
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:36,600
problem solving now in my professional

792
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:39,490
careers I say okay what's our problem

793
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,659
define the problem and then I say okay

794
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:42,250
well now that I have the problem I need

795
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,320
to figure out solutions and I start to

796
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:47,080
iterate through the solutions and then I

797
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,189
create a plan and I can't tell you how

798
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,770
much this approach has changed my life

799
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:53,380
because what it's really done is it's

800
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:55,600
given me the confidence to know that I

801
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:57,460
can follow through on the plans because

802
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,649
it doesn't have to be big that's the

803
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:02,590
thing these plans these things that

804
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:04,840
you're gonna do don't do big things do

805
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:08,070
small things do a series of small things

806
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:10,750
do nested development like we've all

807
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:12,280
that's where is that oh there we go

808
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,380
we've all done that do nested

809
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,290
development so I broke it down that I

810
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:20,320
had to write I had to research

811
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:23,770
conferences and I had to learn how to

812
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:27,159
write a CFP Thank You Ben for helping me

813
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:28,870
write my first CF being and then I got a

814
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,430
system in place and I did it and I

815
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,600
dedicated I put it on my calendar I

816
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,190
counted that I was going to spend this

817
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,840
amount of time every single week on

818
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:36,760
writing and it wasn't much and I was so

819
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,500
bad at the beginning and then I got

820
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,730
better

821
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,990
and I got better and I was able to write

822
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:41,940
more is able to do more and I got

823
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:44,550
editing because here's the thing it

824
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,840
takes 21 days to make a habit that's it

825
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:49,710
you can force yourself to do something

826
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:52,500
for 21 days when your brain says hey why

827
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:54,030
aren't you doing that thing it'll go go

828
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,710
do it you feel weird you have to do this

829
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,350
or you're gonna feel weird and you can

830
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:59,430
do that with anything in your life it's

831
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,389
unbelievable

832
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,740
when you walk out of the house without

833
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:05,550
shoes on why does that feel weird

834
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:07,230
because it's a habit all those things

835
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,790
you can program your brain like a

836
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,710
computer and there's research and

837
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:12,060
literature and I can show you guys or

838
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,250
share it whatever you guys want you can

839
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:18,270
literally program your brain like a

840
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:21,810
computer habits habits habits habits 7

841
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:24,000
days to break 21 days to make so I broke

842
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:26,250
the habits of not writing and started

843
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,590
writing every single day for 20 minutes

844
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:31,020
20 minutes I apply spent more time on

845
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:33,240
the toilet than I was writing at that

846
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,700
time but every day for 20 minutes turn

847
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,190
into 30 turned in an hour and now my

848
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,660
writing skills even like conceptually

849
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:42,540
I'm a professional writer I've been

850
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:44,130
published I'm also a lawyer I was a

851
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,170
terrible writer when it came to like

852
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:47,760
things that were compelling because

853
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,930
there wasn't practiced at it it wasn't

854
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,930
something I developed a habit at so I

855
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:54,390
got I got in the habit of it and I made

856
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:56,820
small projects so there I was I was

857
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:59,610
writing I got my first talk at show-me

858
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:02,129
con and then the ball started to roll

859
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:05,820
downhill almost so fast it was scary I

860
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:08,070
did show me calm then I did b-sides and

861
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:11,100
then I did a slew of other conferences

862
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:12,629
and the whole thing that came down here

863
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,310
was every time they liked one of those

864
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,780
things would happen I'd come back to you

865
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:18,600
know whatever wherever I had written it

866
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:21,990
down and I would say okay what worked

867
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,669
what didn't iterate revise revisit every

868
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:26,160
single time but I can't stress enough

869
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:27,750
step 3 you got to write it out again

870
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,270
research and science underpins

871
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:32,430
everything that I'm telling you today

872
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:35,280
there is a power to writing something

873
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:37,590
down when you write something on paper

874
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,840
it becomes something your brain has to

875
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:43,470
scratch it doesn't work the same with

876
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,110
this or this so when you write it down

877
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,070
your odds of completing that goal go up

878
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:50,250
by 80%

879
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:51,210
I think it's higher but the best my

880
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:53,520
brain can remember is 80

881
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:55,440
I think it's actually about 87 but 80%

882
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,990
chance of completing the goal you write

883
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,909
down micro goals structured like a

884
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:02,039
computer program nested stuff

885
00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:04,320
big big big little little little tiny

886
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:05,908
tiny tiny and it adds up because it

887
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,740
keeps coming back and back and back and

888
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:11,220
back and back and then you do it over

889
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:14,159
and over and over again so iterate

890
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:17,250
revise revisit and keep updating it if

891
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,770
you're not doing that part the documents

892
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,880
dead that you should be seeing it you

893
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:24,210
should be looking at it you should be

894
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,870
feeling it so here's how I did those

895
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:29,159
things I talked it out I've talked to

896
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:30,779
actually several of you in this room

897
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:32,850
about what my goals were and what I

898
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:35,700
wanted to do and how I wanted to get

899
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:37,918
there and I was you know a lot of them

900
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:40,250
were not very good because I was

901
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,299
brainstorming and getting extreme

902
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:46,350
streaking across the stage at a large

903
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:47,970
conference was hard pass lots of ideas I

904
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:50,010
thought would have gotten traction but

905
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,899
it didn't but I talked about it because

906
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:53,429
here's the other thing writing it out

907
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:56,959
increases your odds of completing a goal

908
00:33:53,429 --> 00:33:59,909
by by 80% talking about it is an

909
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,880
exponential impact on your ability to do

910
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:05,100
it collective decision making that's

911
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,480
really just solo support is one of the

912
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,159
most powerful things that you can learn

913
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,899
to do because if you talk to people

914
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,300
about it you build consensus around it

915
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:14,190
couple things happen first they're gonna

916
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,950
have really good ideas it takes a

917
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:18,990
village to do all of this crap I have

918
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:21,449
not had any talk or anything that I've

919
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:23,009
developed in a silo all of my biggest

920
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:24,868
projects because the biggest successes

921
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:27,330
were built with other people because

922
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:30,119
you're really really good at one thing

923
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:31,139
and that's being you and everybody else

924
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:33,359
is really really good at being

925
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:35,520
themselves but together their lessons in

926
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,918
your lessons start to converge see I'm

927
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,440
tying it all back I'm hooking it in into

928
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,759
something that's really cool so the

929
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,379
other one is the micro meso and macro

930
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:47,429
this is my new favorite trio of words

931
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:49,139
that I'm trying to figure out ways to

932
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:50,668
work into talks and I think the way that

933
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:53,399
I'm going to work it into this talk is

934
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:56,520
that focus on the small the medium and

935
00:34:53,399 --> 00:35:00,060
the large short term medium range long

936
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,480
range and what I find is is that I set

937
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,220
not just goals

938
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,079
but like metrics I just treat it like

939
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,368
okay I have to hit these metrics in

940
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:08,470
order to accomplish what I want to do

941
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:11,380
and then reward yourself

942
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:12,819
like literally predefined rewards like

943
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,320
my wife and I have a board when we hit

944
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,520
all of our goals for a week I know this

945
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,170
sounds really ridiculous and it doesn't

946
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,400
work all the time but it doesn't work

947
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:19,990
sometimes and like at the end of the

948
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,400
week if we hit all the goals like you

949
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:23,529
get 50 dollars I mean like I'm not

950
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,410
kidding like it works like pay yourself

951
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:28,660
to do yourself seriously because when

952
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:29,828
you do this stuff and you add in things

953
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,060
like how you're gonna save money and

954
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:32,619
whatever stuff this stuff will pay for

955
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,119
itself even when you're paying yourself

956
00:35:32,619 --> 00:35:36,970
like you don't even like it's hard to

957
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:37,930
even Express but it really is there and

958
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:40,118
if you need someone to hold you

959
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,480
accountable I will text the out of

960
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:43,150
you

961
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,970
like I will set up a service I will talk

962
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:47,619
to you we've got you know we've got

963
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,959
forum boards we've got email smoke

964
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:54,250
signals we can send damn Yarger out to

965
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:57,280
your house like he's just does everybody

966
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:59,859
know dan is dancing on the room now damn

967
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,060
damn laughs dance sexy Yarger I forgot

968
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:07,839
to put the picture of him on the pool

969
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:09,578
table I'll find it don't worry hold

970
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,700
yourself accountable that's really the

971
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:15,520
thing the visual plan I don't know why

972
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:17,950
but the visual plan works for me science

973
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,369
shows it works so I've got a huge

974
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:23,560
whiteboard all of my projects I break

975
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:25,900
things out in the micro meso macro so or

976
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:28,000
so I've got you know now which means I'm

977
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,650
already a few days behind I've got next

978
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,150
which is the next week or so and then

979
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:34,630
I've got you know bigger ones which are

980
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:35,650
a month out those visual plans of how

981
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,940
you're doing it don't have to be

982
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:38,440
sophisticated Minds literally just a

983
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:41,440
whiteboard with some magnets and some

984
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,790
words that I put next to it but again by

985
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,140
putting it up there and doing it you

986
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:46,480
start to actually do this stuff there's

987
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,980
a power behind it and the last one the

988
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,250
macro is really keeping track of big

989
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:55,150
progress reward yourself like talk about

990
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:59,109
it this is a lesson that I

991
00:36:55,150 --> 00:37:00,869
the hard way if you don't talk about

992
00:36:59,109 --> 00:37:04,420
yourself nobody else will

993
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:06,519
if you don't promote yourself no one

994
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:08,170
else will I mean your wife or your

995
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:11,499
girlfriend your boyfriend your mom your

996
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:12,700
grandmother they will promote you but

997
00:37:11,499 --> 00:37:14,348
they won't promote you at work

998
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,990
they won't promote you personally

999
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:18,509
professionally I was always really bad

1000
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:20,919
at this I know it's hard to imagine

1001
00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:24,789
because I love talking and clearlove the

1002
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:26,589
sound of my own voice right now but I

1003
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:28,329
was terrible at it I still am terrible

1004
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:29,799
at Twitter I don't just doesn't I don't

1005
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,749
understand but like I get it

1006
00:37:29,799 --> 00:37:35,410
but I'm not good at talking about myself

1007
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:40,029
and so I made a promise to myself I had

1008
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:42,759
a really big I hid my macro goal in

1009
00:37:40,029 --> 00:37:46,299
March I gave two talks at South by

1010
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:50,099
Southwest which was one of the proudest

1011
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:52,569
things I've ever done I put on two talks

1012
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:57,039
both were part of a series called mental

1013
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:58,660
health rebellion and the first talk and

1014
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,249
this is just how weird things are so

1015
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:03,489
they asked me to put on this talk on

1016
00:38:00,249 --> 00:38:06,720
International Women's Day there should

1017
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:09,660
be a lot more chuckling at that unless

1018
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,890
no no we're good

1019
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:14,348
they asked me to put on a talk at

1020
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:16,328
International Women's Day and then

1021
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:18,700
wanted me to moderate it and they wanted

1022
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:20,589
to put me on the invitation and I just

1023
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,970
don't think you guys get this but we

1024
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:24,578
went with it I fade into the background

1025
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:26,950
gave a voice to some amazing people that

1026
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:28,630
were doing this and then the next one

1027
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:29,890
was mental health rebellion 101 and we

1028
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:31,480
brought experts from all over the

1029
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,549
country to come in and talk about these

1030
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,440
humongous system-wide frameworks about

1031
00:38:33,549 --> 00:38:37,869
how to do this and I had never really

1032
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,700
talked much about myself I never I mean

1033
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:42,700
that's not true like promoting myself

1034
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:44,859
social media wise and whatnot the group

1035
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,239
that put that talk on was the United

1036
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:48,910
Nations sustainable development goals

1037
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:51,369
and they asked me to come to General

1038
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:54,098
Assembly in September to put on a series

1039
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:56,430
of talks about mental health and that

1040
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:59,950
then became the thing I'm most proud of

1041
00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:01,629
but it all built enrolled on itself

1042
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:05,970
everything was underpinned from that

1043
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:07,830
very first decision to start writing

1044
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:10,230
small goal

1045
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:11,520
and it built and that's why like when

1046
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,630
Dave said can you come give this talk

1047
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,460
like I'm a little emotional right now

1048
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:16,230
I'll be honest like that's why this was

1049
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:18,570
so important to me because this was my

1050
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:20,220
four year cycle I said an 18-month goal

1051
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,470
to start to talk at big conferences at

1052
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,779
month 18 to 24 I talked it I spoke at

1053
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:26,819
hims I gave a talk in front of thousands

1054
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,890
of people at s ap sapphire two years ago

1055
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:30,630
like one of those things where the stage

1056
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:36,060
was like four stories tall

1057
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:38,280
I was so pukey oh my god I don't even

1058
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:41,279
think my head came up to the bottom of

1059
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:44,160
the screen it was so big and I was so it

1060
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,810
was just terrible but the technology

1061
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:53,089
failed every speaker screen there died

1062
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:56,070
and had to do it all from memory yeah

1063
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:57,720
and I can help it because everything

1064
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:59,640
that I was talking about was all the

1065
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,770
 that I had written everything that

1066
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,629
I built up to was all nesting in on

1067
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:06,150
itself so once I got up there and I got

1068
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:07,530
in the flow I blacked out and then woke

1069
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,820
up and I had done a good job like I just

1070
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,680
didn't even have to think about it it

1071
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,970
just came out of me it's like I think

1072
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,259
this is one of the first talks where I

1073
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,730
feel like I've been present whenever I

1074
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,740
give talks head like this dissociative

1075
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:18,030
event where I'm not really there this

1076
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,680
one's a lot more from the heart so I'm

1077
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:22,890
actually like I'm here with you guys

1078
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:25,919
which is really fun but I did and like

1079
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:30,950
it was unbelievable that dove tailed or

1080
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:33,060
pushed or rolled into a innovation

1081
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:35,220
award-winning project on data

1082
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:39,390
anonymization and mental health crisis

1083
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:42,689
data for an entire region I'm really big

1084
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:46,920
on other people paying for things and

1085
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:48,630
I've got s ap to put hundreds of

1086
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,920
thousands of dollars into proving that

1087
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,690
mental health needed to have an

1088
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,550
anonymous ation model that had the

1089
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,530
ability to do it there was a business

1090
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:57,600
model for it at one point we had like 25

1091
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:59,160
people from Germany talking about data

1092
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,080
science and security and all this stuff

1093
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,520
and it's like holy like this all

1094
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,770
came from that very first decision I

1095
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,300
want to write on it I want to build it I

1096
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:07,880
want to do it and then I wanted to roll

1097
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:12,290
it into something I was passionate for

1098
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:14,640
so this is really kind of like how I

1099
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:16,200
approach things this is this is like the

1100
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,420
human centered design aspect of

1101
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,460
I wanted because I wanted to define my

1102
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:23,190
problem I think a lot of times that's

1103
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:24,900
such a hard question to ask it's such a

1104
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,940
hard thing like what's my problem I have

1105
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:29,190
a lot of problems have a lot of things

1106
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,930
I'd like to tackle don't do that pick

1107
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,520
small things pick one thing

1108
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:34,950
pick two things pick them little and

1109
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,650
then just tackle that one thing because

1110
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:41,189
here's here's the thing if you do this

1111
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:42,089
for 21 days it becomes a habit and then

1112
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,470
you start to get better at

1113
00:41:42,089 --> 00:41:45,359
problem-solving you start to get better

1114
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:47,129
at figuring out and then instead of

1115
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,930
doing these big peaks and valleys and

1116
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,880
shifts all up and down you your your

1117
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:52,770
band gets a little narrower a little

1118
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,890
narrower and you start to regulate and

1119
00:41:52,770 --> 00:42:00,690
modulate and for someone with mental

1120
00:41:55,890 --> 00:42:01,890
illness this really helps me because it

1121
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:03,119
helps me understand the intrusive

1122
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,560
thoughts helps me understand what's not

1123
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,339
real what's just you know depression

1124
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:11,339
talking or anxiety talking I can't tell

1125
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:14,490
you how many times I've sat after a talk

1126
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:16,078
just like this and had to go to my room

1127
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:18,629
and mind raced over oh my god it was so

1128
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,070
terrible Ben left halfway through Dan

1129
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,579
didn't even stay past the first minute

1130
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,890
or two

1131
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:24,630
like that's my brain I have to turn off

1132
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:27,598
all those thoughts all those burns all

1133
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:29,460
those things but once I created the

1134
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,480
plans once I stuck with the plans it

1135
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,329
really got to a place where I could

1136
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,099
start to trust myself and that's the

1137
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:37,200
real key behind this whole thing that's

1138
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:38,849
the whole key behind talking it out with

1139
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,310
people developing these different

1140
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:43,920
metrics having a visual plan is that you

1141
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:46,290
create something that is almost meta of

1142
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,060
you whether you're doing it and work or

1143
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:49,259
you're doing it personally that meta

1144
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:51,029
nests of what you're trying to

1145
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:53,160
accomplish become something that you can

1146
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:56,910
trust in and rely in when gets hard

1147
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:59,549
because what we've been told our whole

1148
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:00,629
lives is that we are whole and

1149
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:02,130
everything in us is real we have to

1150
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:03,560
listen to our feelings or bottle them up

1151
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:06,359
or you know whatever one of those things

1152
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:08,250
that's not true like there are thoughts

1153
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:09,660
in everyone's brains that are intrusive

1154
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:11,369
that are bought that are wrong they're

1155
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,740
not even real they're not even like your

1156
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:16,640
consciousness doing it it's depression

1157
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:18,720
it's anxiety it's whatever

1158
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,950
but they're called intrusive thoughts

1159
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,609
has anybody ever heard of intrusive

1160
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:25,439
thoughts yeah read them read up about

1161
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:26,880
them if you haven't it's amazing it will

1162
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,380
help you feel so much better to

1163
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,610
understand the concept of intrusive

1164
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,620
thoughts

1165
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:32,970
because they're not real so the whole

1166
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:34,410
idea behind this was I wanted to make

1167
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:37,919
this plan I wanted to build this for

1168
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:40,649
myself because I mean like it's not too

1169
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,900
far an exaggeration say to save my life

1170
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:44,250
the projects I'm working on now the

1171
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,220
things I'm doing the people I'm talking

1172
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:49,350
to I can't even understand that that's

1173
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,819
actually me it doesn't feel like it's me

1174
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:52,140
it doesn't even feel like that's who I

1175
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,490
am or what I'm doing because in the

1176
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:56,330
middle of the night I saw the anxiety

1177
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:58,470
gerbils just like spinning on that wheel

1178
00:43:56,330 --> 00:44:00,000
but it gets better because you start to

1179
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:03,200
trust in yourself you start to trust in

1180
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,670
that plan and that development and then

1181
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,160
wake up kick ass and repeat and then you

1182
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:09,780
have bad days you have good days like I

1183
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,040
have one more concept to pass on before

1184
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,310
I stop is anybody ever heard of the

1185
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,090
center in st. dichotomy oh cool we get

1186
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:18,660
some education okay

1187
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:19,530
who's who's been ever been a smoker okay

1188
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,690
good

1189
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:25,800
who's ever tried to quit smoking okay

1190
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:26,490
good who's ever drank alcohol okay well

1191
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,720
as a lot more hands

1192
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:31,709
okay who's ever tried to stop drinking

1193
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:33,509
alcohol I feel CLS who's ever been on a

1194
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:36,150
diet there's one we can all get on okay

1195
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:37,490
and who cheated on their diet everybody

1196
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:41,040
raise their hands there we go

1197
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:43,140
the Center in st. dichotomy is a is this

1198
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,970
concept in psychology that when you

1199
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,310
cheat your brains like it up taking

1200
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:49,770
my clothes off let's do it it's supposed

1201
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:51,810
to be like I am nonlinear human being

1202
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,280
I'm going to mess up and that's okay I

1203
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:54,509
don't have to take my clothes off and

1204
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,720
run through the conference it will be

1205
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:56,720
fine

1206
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:00,840
seriously it's the center in st.

1207
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,549
methodology and like we teach ourselves

1208
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,630
like well I smoked once today it

1209
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:05,850
I'm just going to smoke the rest today

1210
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:08,220
or I did 12 shots tequila I'm gonna go

1211
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:10,920
to the craps table like all these things

1212
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,240
our brain does they're not real they're

1213
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,350
intrusive thoughts they're real because

1214
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,549
they're thoughts but they're not really

1215
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:16,290
like what you're trying to do so keep

1216
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:17,940
that in mind like be gentle with

1217
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:19,770
yourselves these things are gonna go bad

1218
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,630
they're gonna go good I'm always here my

1219
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:23,100
contact is on the next page email meets

1220
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:24,300
my personal email you can reach out and

1221
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,930
I'm more than happy to talk to anybody

1222
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,470
about it

1223
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:30,899
don't let the center insane dichotomy

1224
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:33,000
 you up because it will it's really

1225
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,750
hard because then who was raised

1226
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,160
Christian who's a recovering Catholic

1227
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:40,930
anybody who's an existing Catholic but

1228
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:44,500
contemplating recovering Catholic Lots

1229
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:46,930
Jewish Hindu Muslim the guilt that we

1230
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:49,330
program into our brains for the sinner

1231
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:51,848
in st. economy permeates every aspect of

1232
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:53,410
our lives I didn't do this I start to

1233
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:56,380
feel bad I should have done this and

1234
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:57,848
your performance just goes and that's

1235
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:59,560
the sinner in st. économique the truth

1236
00:45:57,849 --> 00:46:02,050
is is that we're never perfect we're all

1237
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,400
nonlinear human beings it's always up

1238
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,619
and down in side to side in a round

1239
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:08,260
there's no straight path no matter what

1240
00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:09,700
Instagram or Facebook tells you nobody

1241
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:13,599
is having that much fun and doing that

1242
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:15,129
good ever because it's nonlinear we're

1243
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,270
all nonlinear so be gentle with

1244
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:18,010
yourselves

1245
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:19,599
my name is Hudson Harris and I'm more

1246
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:23,589
than happy to stay and talk if anybody

1247
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:25,570
wants to email me or tweet at me I think

1248
00:46:23,589 --> 00:46:29,859
I'm also on Marco Polo I don't really

1249
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:31,570
understand yet either I don't know why I

1250
00:46:29,859 --> 00:46:32,799
would video text messaged somebody it

1251
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,910
doesn't make sense I don't want to see

1252
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,880
them that's why I'm texting them but

1253
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:39,009
nonetheless I'm available anytime to

1254
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,900
talk and go out there and kick some ass

1255
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:42,939
guys

1256
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,939
[Music]

1257
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:57,290
does anybody have any questions no we're

1258
00:46:54,950 --> 00:47:14,600
covered oh yes hi thank you for coming

1259
00:46:57,290 --> 00:47:16,520
again yeah yes

1260
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,690
so consensus here's how I get consensus

1261
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,160
because the question was do you ever

1262
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:21,140
find your projects get paralyzed with

1263
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:23,390
consensus absolutely I hate

1264
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:24,589
group projects I do all the work and

1265
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:27,020
everybody else gets all the credit it's

1266
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:31,250
 however here's what I found

1267
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:35,840
blind ranking is the only way to go on

1268
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:38,060
this slide right here so here's an

1269
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,980
example of how to do this so what I

1270
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:41,120
encourage all of my clients that I work

1271
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:44,030
with to do on this is called blind

1272
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:46,040
ranking everybody gets a note card you

1273
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:48,170
write the number of ideas or whatever it

1274
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:51,410
is and then everybody blind ranks it and

1275
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:53,300
then one person takes them and compiles

1276
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,620
them and whatever your statistical model

1277
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:58,130
or you add them up or however you do it

1278
00:47:54,620 --> 00:48:00,500
is the top three go and that's part of

1279
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:03,050
setting constraints that's part of how

1280
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:04,730
to get that constraint model in because

1281
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:06,650
then you don't get personal investment

1282
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:08,600
or personal loss when someone's ideas in

1283
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:10,880
picked and somebody voted for odds are

1284
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,960
the idea that was picked so that's one

1285
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,790
of the ways I've addressed kind of the

1286
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,620
consensus problem is blind voting they

1287
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:17,390
even have apps now where you can blind

1288
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:21,259
vote on your app and it'll score it for

1289
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:22,420
a mod in the room now any other

1290
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:26,860
questions

1291
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:26,860
No okay thank you everybody
