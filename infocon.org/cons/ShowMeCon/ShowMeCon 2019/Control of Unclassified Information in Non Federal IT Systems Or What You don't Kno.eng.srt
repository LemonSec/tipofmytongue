thank you appreciate it

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,700
can you guys hear me in the back all

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:39,450
right we're good I saw a thumbs up great

11

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:46,050
was you okay you got to give up that

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:49,230
blue shirt just for saying that no sew

14
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,269
up Tim grace there's kind of my

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,370
background I'm a director of technology

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,610
risk advisory services for Mueller Prost

17
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,190
we are a we have a booth out there we

18
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,579
are a CPA and business advisor firm but

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,289
I had up this part of the practice 35

20
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,630
years experience in information

21
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,240
technology I like to say that I spent

22
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,149
four years as an accountant slash

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,298
regulatory accountant slash financial

24
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,490
auditor but in reality what they had me

25
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,229
do was a why they hired me is because I

26
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,908
had 10 years experience that point and

27
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:22,560
they hired me to convert all of their

28
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,140
dumb terminals or green-screen

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,740
terminals some of the terms that some of

30
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:32,340
the younger folks use to desktops um my

31
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,829
company is Mueller Prost been in

32
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,990
business since 1983 I guess there were a

33
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:40,490
CPA firm heavily involved in the tax

34
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:44,130
area of financial services assurance

35
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:46,560
attestation reviews business valuation

36
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:51,869
but that's not what I do I I'm on the

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,210
technology side so you know what I'm

38
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,950
doing what I look at everybody watch

39
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,630
them do instead of pointing this thing

40
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,520
at the computer and clicking I'm

41
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:03,479
pointing it at the screen and that's not

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:08,068
working it's not working either way come

43
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:11,280
on there we go visit our booth we're

44
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:13,739
giving away a dome scope which is a

45
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,710
Wi-Fi device for

46
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:23,460
finding really finding rogue access

47
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:25,290
devices aka the schrodinger scope the

48
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,000
question about is the schrodinger scope

49
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,880
before you look into there is that

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,550
access device on or is it off is it

51
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,350
there are as a not there if you don't

52
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,330
know anything about the Schrodinger box

53
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,160
are the Schrodinger's cat look it up on

54
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,860
the internet but we're given this way

55
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,829
it's a pretty cool device so let's jump

56
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,840
into exactly what we're talking about

57
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:48,450
this is the session objective if you've

58
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,230
read the bio if you've looked at what's

59
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,119
what

60
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,540
show me Kant's put out this is what's on

61
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,990
here but we're going to talk about the

62
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:59,489
controlled unclassified information the

63
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,920
executive order was put into place and

64
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:05,520
what took place after the executive

65
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,220
order so let's jump right into it what

66
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,820
you need to know maybe I'm not close

67
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,710
enough so we're gonna talk about the

68
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,930
history of it who needs to comply

69
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,460
guidance and really what's the risk

70
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:25,610
because that's what it boils down to at

71
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:27,510
the end let me see if I can fix this

72
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:36,630
technology is great except when it

73
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:40,470
doesn't work there we go so the

74
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:43,769
executive order 13563 signed into place

75
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:46,320
November 10 2010 for by President Barack

76
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:48,690
Obama what this basically said was that

77
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,299
if you are an organization that has

78
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:55,350
controlled unclassified information you

79
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:58,050
need to protect it I highlight some

80
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,910
things on here the most interesting

81
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:02,310
thing to me as I read through this order

82
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,560
is excluding information that is

83
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:09,000
classified under executive order 13526

84
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,550
as of December 29th 2009 2009 which kind

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,500
of leaves me a question you're talking

86
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,410
about unclassified information which I

87
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,140
get but now you're telling me that

88
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:21,060
unclassified are classified information

89
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:23,460
did not have to be protected prior to

90
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,840
2009 which I think is a misnomer but I

91
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,430
guess they put that in the executive

92
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,739
order so the

93
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,350
things about if you read this executive

94
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,289
order what it talks about and the

95
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,810
keywords are non-federal systems and

96
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:38,789
organizations everybody understands that

97
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,220
you have to for a federal organization

98
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:42,840
you have to protect your unclassified

99
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,380
are your controlled unclassified

100
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,508
information I will say cuy is the

101
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,240
acronym for it so if you just go through

102
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:53,370
it highlight where it says non-federal

103
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,860
systems non-federal systems and

104
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,840
organizations down federal systems and

105
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,360
organizations as we go through this

106
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:07,979
we're going to explain exactly what they

107
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:09,180
mean what the executive order did was it

108
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:11,460
really did two things

109
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,699
it turned to the National Archives and

110
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:16,799
Records Administration Nara to develop

111
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,389
exactly what cou he is and they went

112
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,280
through and there's a whole list and

113
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:22,979
we'll show you some examples from the

114
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,619
list what exactly who he is and what you

115
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:27,659
need to do and also went to the National

116
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,090
Institute of Standards and Technology to

117
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,669
say hey you got devised a way for

118
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:35,010
everybody to comply with this executive

119
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:38,780
order and comply with the cuy that these

120
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,780
organizations have in their system so

121
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:48,179
these are cuy categories so if you go to

122
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:50,250
the Nara website and you actually do a

123
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,810
list of cooee all you have to really do

124
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,979
is to go to google and type in cui Kui

125
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,900
categories it'll pull up the nara

126
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:59,758
website you can go to this and you can

127
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,580
look and say what is Kui

128
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,949
and so this is just some screen prints

129
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:08,130
from their website you can see up at the

130
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,900
top the website is so this one's on

131
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:12,270
critical infrastructure and as you can

132
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,370
see it goes over to the Q the Kui

133
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,859
categories and it's all of that stuff

134
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,750
under there and there is a lot as you go

135
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,370
through this and so as we go through

136
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,020
this I'm gonna layer on I'm going to

137
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,449
give you some a little more examples so

138
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,490
this is the website if you click on any

139
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:28,280
one of those categories over there it'll

140
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,599
take you into something else

141
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,529
it'll give you this screen which

142
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:36,510
actually describes exactly what it is so

143
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:38,159
we talked about where is it chemical the

144
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,520
second one chemical terrorism

145
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:42,789
vulnerability

146
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,830
makes perfect sense why does that need

147
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:46,240
to be protected and it actually tells

148
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,878
you why it needs to be protected

149
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,789
category descriptions category markings

150
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:54,789
how you have to mark the information the

151
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:56,560
business format working notes and it

152
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,780
also gives you some references down at

153
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,099
the bottom exactly what they're talking

154
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,780
about and where to go for more

155
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:04,030
information because this isn't

156
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,580
necessarily a one-stop shop for all of

157
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:09,159
your cuy information but it's a place

158
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:11,770
that kicks you off into other agencies

159
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:13,990
other documents other sections of the

160
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:18,310
federal government to tell you exactly

161
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:19,900
what ku is so let's talk about the cuy

162
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,780
markings and I think there's a lot of

163
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,599
confusion on this because as you go

164
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,309
through Nara as you go through NIST and

165
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,349
you look at what needs to be marked and

166
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,330
what needs to be marked some of this

167
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:34,120
stuff is optional and it's really left

168
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:36,580
up to one the agency that the the cuy

169
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,400
might belong to are the agencies that is

170
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,840
working with the non-federal system that

171
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,840
is in a non-federal

172
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,419
organization and it's really left up to

173
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,520
the user exactly what needs to be marked

174
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:50,620
now there are some specific stanlon

175
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,330
standards and guidelines on exactly what

176
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,610
needs to be marked and down at the

177
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,590
bottom you'll see how it needs to be

178
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,779
marked so you have to have a control

179
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:01,330
marking to say hey this is cuy

180
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:03,430
information you have to have a category

181
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,818
or subcategory which goes back to the

182
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:09,400
previous slides and then limited

183
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:11,680
dissemination control marking nothing to

184
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,448
me on this says that while this is

185
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,370
something that's very difficult to do or

186
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:16,870
hard to do or something that we in the

187
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,840
security world haven't been doing

188
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:24,009
forever with security categories and

189
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:32,279
whatnot with the internal documentation

190
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:32,279
or internal documents so come on

191
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:44,219
there we go so just a sample of some cuy

192
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:48,709
markings and these are straight from the

193
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:51,480
Nara website and from the NIST stuff but

194
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:54,420
you can see up at the top where they

195
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:58,920
actually have it marked its Kui what how

196
00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:02,459
it's specified and alphabetized Kui

197
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,769
basic levels and so on and so forth so

198
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:06,899
in you know you can go down and see

199
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:13,589
exactly what the memo is about and how

200
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:15,810
it should be marked so as we go further

201
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:18,329
and further into this I wanted to show

202
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:21,930
everybody some examples of what exactly

203
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:24,510
is Kui so let me let me see a show of

204
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:27,890
hands who's worked with Kui information

205
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:32,250
before who understands this okay so

206
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:34,709
maybe about 10-15 percent of you so who

207
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,170
has it even who hasn't heard about this

208
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:39,959
in the past so I'm seeing I'm seeing

209
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:43,229
much more hands so this is something to

210
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:44,729
me as we go through this as I started

211
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,500
going through this and looking at this

212
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:51,000
and I've only been looking at this piece

213
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:54,529
of it probably since 2016-2017 it gets

214
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,180
very scary exactly how Nara display

215
00:09:54,529 --> 00:10:00,720
disseminated and said what exactly is

216
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:03,420
Kui and who has to apply with Kui so few

217
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,940
examples if you do anything if your

218
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:08,279
organization is a financial organization

219
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,770
falls under the Comptroller General and

220
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:12,839
you can see the category description so

221
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:15,240
if it relates duties transactions or

222
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,880
otherwise falling under a purview and

223
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,680
this is the key financial institutions

224
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,240
are United States government of fiscal

225
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,930
functions and I'm really keying in on

226
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,860
the financial institutions they're you

227
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,500
know this thing's supposed to have a

228
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,810
laser pointer - I think my battery might

229
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,860
be dying anyway financial institutions

230
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,439
if you work for a bank

231
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,740
you have Kui information because you are

232
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,730
a financial institution so it's kind of

233
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,730
its kind of scary

234
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:48,279
intelligence this one makes perfect

235
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,500
sense if you're dealing with the

236
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:54,310
intelligence agencies like we have nga

237
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,959
here NSA FBI CIA so on and so forth it

238
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:59,378
makes total sense you have to be able to

239
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:02,699
keep this information controlled and

240
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:02,699
make sure it's being controlled

241
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:17,079
hmm let me try something because my

242
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:23,170
clickers not working I'm gonna switch to

243
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:46,469
the show-me con clicker bear with me

244
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:46,469
sorry guys this one's not working either

245
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:54,008
hey that might help hey give me a round

246
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:56,330
of applause I know how to work

247
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:57,959
technology thank you thank you thank you

248
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:00,129
[Applause]

249
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:04,029
I'll be back to do this tomorrow night

250
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:07,269
see so privacy this is the one that got

251
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:09,629
me when I first saw this so my wife what

252
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:11,769
two years ago we did the DNA testing

253
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:14,740
went through that process and I'm

254
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:17,889
thinking wow some what some company out

255
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:20,879
there has my DNA my spit I send feel

256
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:22,870
spit in the jar and send it to them and

257
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,149
they need to protect that information

258
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:27,879
that's cool information so if you've

259
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:30,790
ever done DNA testing and by the way I'm

260
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:33,399
Irish and I'm also Scandinavian so I

261
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:35,589
guess I'm an Irish Viking so meaning I

262
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:39,910
can talk forever if you want me to and

263
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:42,550
since I'm part Viking right words may

264
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:46,569
not come out of my mouth that people

265
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,589
like so don't you get me drink and

266
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:53,069
that's a whole different story

267
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:55,059
so so again privacy health information

268
00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:57,430
if you do anything with health

269
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:59,680
information that's cuy that has to be

270
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,959
detected now that also ties into HIPAA

271
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,300
which also ties into health to high-tech

272
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,399
so it's very important if you have any

273
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,370
of that you have to you have to know

274
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,130
what you have and you have to be aware

275
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:15,040
of the NIST 800 171 what's that will

276
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:17,589
describe later doesn't necessarily like

277
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,020
I like I indicated doesn't necessarily

278
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:23,230
mean you have to market according to the

279
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:26,399
standard but somebody may say you have

280
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:29,620
to market so it's something to look at

281
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,750
financial information electronic funds

282
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,760
transfer if you do any type of funds

283
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,970
transfer banks to funds transfers wire

284
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:42,010
transfers ACH is that's cuy information

285
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:44,649
that has to be protected let me point

286
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:47,800
one more thing out down here at the

287
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:52,020
bottom tax information so if you're a

288
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:55,569
company that does taxes for individuals

289
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:58,149
for companies for organizations that tax

290
00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:01,390
information is considered cuy you have

291
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:04,150
to comply with this as well later on

292
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:06,130
we'll talk about the risk that on not

293
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:12,069
complying and what it means if you're

294
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:14,230
not complying so determine your

295
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:16,000
compliance you have to determine what in

296
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,950
your organization is covered what in

297
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,540
your organization is cuy which means you

298
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,610
have to go through an exercise to

299
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,560
discover what you have in your

300
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,450
organization that is cuy and what needs

301
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,699
to be protected and how it needs to be

302
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,500
protected and the big thing about this

303
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,320
is you have to have a cyber incident

304
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,420
reporting system a process that's a

305
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,300
requirement so if there is a

306
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,099
dissemination of your cuy information

307
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,729
you have to be able to report that and

308
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:45,010
you have to be able to track that and

309
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:48,010
you have to have a system security plan

310
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,750
and a plan of action if you are not

311
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:53,500
compliant so system security plan will

312
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:55,149
say yes you are compliant no you're not

313
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,670
compliant and there's a hundred and ten

314
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:59,170
controls to be compliant with maybe

315
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,910
you're only compliant with a hundred of

316
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,310
them so those other ten you have to have

317
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,490
a plan to get compliant whether that's

318
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:10,500
to get compliant within six months or

319
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:10,500
sixty years as long as you have a plan

320
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:18,519
there's some other resources the one

321
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,529
thing about the cuy is it's it's now

322
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:24,250
written into the D FAR's which is the

323
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:26,230
defense Federal Acquisition regulation

324
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,540
do I have it spelled out up there I

325
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,730
always miss what the S means as well as

326
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,160
the Federal Acquisition regulation the D

327
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,800
far as far defense contractors and

328
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,050
defense the far as far civilian

329
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,620
contractors the one thing to know and

330
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:44,290
I've learned this I guess the hard way a

331
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:47,230
little bit is if there's a far and you

332
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:49,329
have a federal contract you have to

333
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,990
comply with every single one of the

334
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:54,939
farts even if there's only ten FAR's

335
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:56,380
specified in your contract the other two

336
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,959
hundred some-odd far is that are out

337
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,279
there Rd far is you can't say well you

338
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,660
didn't put it in my contract I don't

339
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:04,720
have to comply with it you have to

340
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,579
comply with that so there's no saying

341
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,230
why you didn't specify a federal

342
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:13,149
government contractor a department yeah

343
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:17,019
it doesn't matter you still have to

344
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:19,540
comply with it and then there's miss

345
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:23,260
guidance NIST has a lot of good guidance

346
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:26,050
on it so some of the some of the whines

347
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:28,449
okay so now we get into the NIST 801 71

348
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,760
so remember the date

349
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:33,819
November 2010 when this executive order

350
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:36,880
was put into place I don't have a date

351
00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:39,760
exactly when the cuy categories weren't

352
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,139
developed I probably need to do dig dig

353
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:46,300
in and do some more research but

354
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:49,569
somewhere between 2010 and 2015 when

355
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:52,990
they released the first NIST special

356
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:54,389
procedure 800 171 which is protecting

357
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:57,670
controlled unclassified information

358
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:59,410
again in non-federal information systems

359
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:01,829
organizations helped that's when it

360
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:05,678
first came out it was last updated in

361
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:08,470
2016 now it was superseded by revision

362
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:13,089
one which was published in December 2016

363
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:17,290
last updated in 2018 now the one key to

364
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:19,708
this is you have the 171 and then you

365
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:24,280
have the 171 a so if you look through

366
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:24,940
anything this stuff and there's a 171 or

367
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,149
a nosy

368
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:29,770
53 or something if there's an a that's

369
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,050
the assessment guide that's how you

370
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,850
assess your organization per this so

371
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:37,270
there is an a which was actually

372
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:43,990
released in 2018 I will explain in a

373
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:48,150
minute why that was important so we're

374
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:50,590
going to talk about revision one again

375
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,750
highlighted words it's protecting the

376
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:55,870
confidentiality of cooee when Kui is

377
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,580
resident in non-federal system is it

378
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,860
organizations again that's the key to

379
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:04,720
this whole thing now in federal systems

380
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:06,760
and organizations when your system is

381
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,450
collecting or maintaining information on

382
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,950
behalf of a federal agency okay that

383
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,750
makes sense if you're collecting

384
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:16,030
information on behalf of a federal

385
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,920
agency yeah absolutely government can

386
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,750
say you need to be you need to ensure

387
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,030
that it's being protected but then you

388
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:24,130
have that are in there are maintaining

389
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:28,500
information on behalf of the are are

390
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:30,760
using and operate that should be in my

391
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,730
Spelling's terrible's are using an

392
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,310
operating or out opera what am I talking

393
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:37,990
about are using or operating a system on

394
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:39,909
behalf of an agency so if you're using

395
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,070
your operating system again that needs

396
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,470
to be protected but you drop down a

397
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,240
little bit further the security

398
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,640
requirements apply only to components of

399
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,500
non-federal systems non-federal this is

400
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,900
a key non-federal systems that process

401
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,860
store or transmit cuy are that provide

402
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:59,380
security protection for such components

403
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:01,030
you don't necessarily mean that you're

404
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,890
dealing directly with a federal agency

405
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,379
you may fall under the purview of a

406
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:07,840
federal agency such as the IRS with tax

407
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:11,500
information FDIC with banking

408
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,090
information I can go on and on you know

409
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,950
I think I may have skipped the one slide

410
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:16,810
there was a slide in here I might have

411
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,130
deleted it because this is like the

412
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:20,050
third time I've done this presentation

413
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:22,390
but there was one point I wanted to make

414
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:25,060
when I talk about cuy categories in

415
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:27,310
agriculture there's a kui category in

416
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:30,340
agriculture so one point I'd like to

417
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:35,050
make is this this the categories are

418
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:38,560
very subjective so if you are a dairy

419
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,830
farmer and you milk cows and you send

420
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,879
your

421
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:47,168
you milk off for processing the milk

422
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:50,440
that information is subject to Kui to me

423
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:51,850
I don't that may be stretching it but

424
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,159
it's subject to Kui and there's

425
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:59,439
arguments on both sides so let's talk

426
00:19:54,159 --> 00:20:01,090
about 871 so in 871 it actually points

427
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,049
out four things that you have to comply

428
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:10,240
with the FIPS 199 which is very standard

429
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:14,500
and straightforward the FIPS 200 the the

430
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,149
NIST 863 and then appoints to the 853

431
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,460
and so I know some of you that have

432
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:20,439
dealt with the 853 know that this

433
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,940
document and the controls you have to

434
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,899
comply with are gigantic

435
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:29,500
there's like 650 controls so before the

436
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:31,959
800 171 a came out everybody was

437
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,360
pointing to the 53 which gets really

438
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,639
confusing and if you don't work with it

439
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:40,719
on a on a day to day basis and you're

440
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:42,039
not deeply into the 0:53 you don't know

441
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,409
exactly what you have to comply with

442
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:45,940
because in order to get to what you have

443
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:48,820
to comply with you have to know the

444
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,950
categorization of your systems whether

445
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,139
it's a high moderate or low and

446
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:55,840
different system categories have

447
00:20:53,139 --> 00:20:59,289
different controls that you have to put

448
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,689
into place so if you're a low maybe it's

449
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:04,629
120 of those controls if it's a moderate

450
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:07,570
then it's those 120 plus the next 80 so

451
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,279
about 200 but if it's a high down to 650

452
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,168
it's probably somewhere around 600

453
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:13,149
because there are controls in there that

454
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:15,039
you don't necessarily nobody has to

455
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:18,750
comply what they're there that can be

456
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,750
selected but they're not always selected

457
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:29,350
so the 171 it's a diverse it's a it's

458
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:30,909
supposed to be you know people are

459
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:33,250
supposed to build to use it you don't

460
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:36,610
necessarily have to use it for Kui and I

461
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:41,590
also I actually recommend folks to look

462
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:44,879
at the 853 or the 53 as well as the 171

463
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:47,860
instead of going with something like ISO

464
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,760
COBIT something else maybe you look at

465
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,070
this because this is a pretty

466
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,780
comprehensive group of controls that you

467
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,720
should comply with in a pretty

468
00:21:52,780 --> 00:22:07,360
comprehensive process that should be put

469
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:10,810
into place that could be used who are my

470
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,149
CIS ESPYs in here so what do they talk

471
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,320
about when they talk about

472
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:17,020
confidentiality integrity and

473
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,600
availability isn't isn't it the other

474
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,940
way around when they talk when you study

475
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,330
for it it's the instead of the CIA

476
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:28,030
it's the AIC right my right yeah is it

477
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,710
CIA in there I thought was AIC okay

478
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:32,760
there's some doctor there's some

479
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:35,740
guidance that actually talks about AIC

480
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:39,340
but it's the same thing so this is how

481
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:42,040
you figure out exactly what systems what

482
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:44,530
data within your systems are cooing what

483
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:47,379
systems are kuya are actually related to

484
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:50,080
it so low moderate or high so you got

485
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:54,700
the confidentiality the impact you could

486
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:56,620
have a low moderate low system and it

487
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:59,470
would be considered moderate you could

488
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:01,659
have a low low high system and it's

489
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:03,700
considered high you could have a high

490
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:06,280
low low and it's still considered high

491
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:08,890
so whichever one is on top is the

492
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:14,200
highest that's the one that categorizes

493
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:18,580
your system 853 there's actually a

494
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:22,750
pretty nice mapping between 171 and 853

495
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:25,419
that's in the back of 171 which is you

496
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:29,410
know kind of doesn't it's good that it's

497
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:32,170
there but with the release of 171 last

498
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:41,470
June you really don't have to go to 853

499
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:43,270
anymore so there's basic security

500
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:47,440
requirements and there's derived

501
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:50,200
security requirements the difference is

502
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,140
the basic ones are kind of how you

503
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,470
establish and track this and then the

504
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:58,950
derived ones are really how you put it

505
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,950
into place

506
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:07,720
I wish I would have done a slide that

507
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:11,678
actually compares the control families

508
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,330
in 53 to control families in 171 but you

509
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:17,950
can see these are the control families

510
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:21,059
in 171 it's pretty high level at this

511
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:24,490
point but if you look at in any type of

512
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:26,649
security guidance literature anything

513
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,520
standards it's pretty basic and it's

514
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,980
pretty simple

515
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:36,790
as you get into this stuff it it gets

516
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:41,350
more more and more complex system

517
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:44,230
security plans so before the 800 171 a

518
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:47,290
came out last year you actually went 2-0

519
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:52,260
53 and you developed your security plans

520
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:56,020
based on that are based on the 0 8800 -

521
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:58,660
37 which is the risk management

522
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:00,790
framework what they did to simplify this

523
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:03,040
was kind of cool and it made it a lot

524
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:05,980
easier as I've done several of these

525
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:08,860
audits instead of developing a system

526
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:10,150
security plan from scratch are using

527
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:12,219
something that you found from our

528
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:13,929
various agency and it seems like every

529
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:20,080
agency's a little bit different they

530
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:22,419
actually gave you guidance so you got to

531
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,439
identify the system you got to talk

532
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:28,630
about what type of environment what the

533
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,390
requirements section is and then it

534
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:34,360
drops down to the actual control so I

535
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:36,160
access control you can actually click if

536
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,899
it's implemented if you plan to be

537
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,380
implemented or some of the stuff might

538
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:43,030
not be applicable at all obviously

539
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,799
access control is not applicable but

540
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,840
there's other things within there that

541
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:54,790
may not be applicable to your certain

542
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:59,110
impure environment poems anybody's heard

543
00:25:54,790 --> 00:26:00,610
the term poem all my federal people that

544
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:02,260
have worked with this in the past so

545
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:04,059
this is really your issues as you're

546
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,700
going through the assessment and you

547
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:10,570
identify gaps what they want you to do

548
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:12,130
is put together a plan of action plan of

549
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,510
action and milestones so it's a plan of

550
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,250
action here's how I'm going to fix this

551
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:19,270
and here's the milestones

552
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:20,710
I have have to harden my system so I'm

553
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,120
gonna harden it here's what I'm gonna do

554
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,700
and here's the milestones I'm going to

555
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:28,270
do these 10 servers by you know July

556
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,679
30th 31st these 10 by August 30th that

557
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:33,100
I'm gonna have the whole process done

558
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:36,190
not just completed implemented or

559
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:39,250
remediated but I'm also going to have

560
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:49,360
testing performed again so you perform

561
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:56,080
testing after you fix the issue so this

562
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:59,289
is from the 800 101 71 egg so you can

563
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:05,139
see the difference so up at the top the

564
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:08,580
3.6 the incident response this is what

565
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:11,770
you had to look at and comply with now

566
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,870
as an auditor as a past auditor some of

567
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:15,730
this you look at it establish an

568
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:18,070
operational incident handling capability

569
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:20,260
for organizational systems okay so so

570
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:22,059
you got to comply with that so how do

571
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,070
you write your audit steps how do you

572
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:27,389
write your assessment steps and I think

573
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:30,100
this is the this is where as a

574
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:32,770
organization you get into a lot of

575
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:35,469
trouble you get into a lot of overwork

576
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:37,210
and you put a lot of time into taking it

577
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,919
from where it's at up there the basic

578
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:41,590
security requirements and say exactly

579
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:45,039
what that means down to when they

580
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:50,020
release the 171 a exactly what they

581
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:52,690
wanted you to do so some people say you

582
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,549
know it's a versus it's doubt of versus

583
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:56,770
but it's how the documents complement

584
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:57,940
each other so the a is the assessment

585
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:00,580
piece and as you can see at the bottom

586
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:02,860
there's the security requirement track

587
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:04,750
documented report incidents and here's

588
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:07,689
the steps which are called determine if

589
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:10,840
make sure that our instance tracked are

590
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:12,940
they documented authorities to whom

591
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,100
instance are reported and identify so

592
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,169
this actually gives you the individual

593
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,250
steps that you want to comply with you

594
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:20,470
you want to make sure that your

595
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:23,909
organization complies with and your

596
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,909
system are complies with

597
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,940
this is the mapping table which is kind

598
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:36,129
of kind of cool it Maps not only does it

599
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:38,230
map to NIST 853 but it also maps to ISO

600
00:28:36,129 --> 00:28:40,908
27001

601
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:43,279
and if you do a google search you want

602
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:45,830
to say okay you know I don't really care

603
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,109
if it maps to ISO does it map to PCI

604
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:50,029
does it map to high-tech does it map to

605
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:52,399
high-trust does it map to some something

606
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:54,230
else CSC something else out there if you

607
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,850
do a Google search there's a ton of

608
00:28:54,230 --> 00:29:00,190
stuff out there somebody's put it

609
00:28:55,850 --> 00:29:00,189
together somewhere so go check that out

610
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:10,700
so steps to comply know what your cuy

611
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:12,230
date is I suggest doing a survey and

612
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:18,259
send it out to your all your department

613
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:22,100
heads individuals asking exactly what

614
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:23,749
cuy they have I wouldn't say gee tell me

615
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:26,840
what your cuy is but I would go through

616
00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:30,379
the categories and list things that that

617
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:32,600
may be cuy within your business send

618
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:34,279
that out see what you got and in that

619
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,799
that way once you understand that then

620
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:40,249
then you target those specific systems

621
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:43,850
those specific processes your network is

622
00:29:40,249 --> 00:29:45,320
probably going to be cooee information

623
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:48,799
you're probably gonna have to include

624
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:52,220
that in there depending on how many

625
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:54,460
systems how many processes you have you

626
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:57,769
may have multiple system security plans

627
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:59,210
so you could have one for your your

628
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:00,980
network you could have one for your

629
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:03,799
platform you could have one for your gr

630
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:06,139
C system you could have one for your ERP

631
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:08,090
system your accounting so on and so

632
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:10,549
forth you could just go down the line to

633
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:13,039
determine how many you have so you could

634
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:15,980
have one for the entire organization or

635
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:19,100
you could have 10 20 30 it really adds

636
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:22,869
up after time performant gap analysis

637
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:25,428
look at and document where your gaps are

638
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:27,139
some people don't like to call these

639
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:28,999
audits but at the end of the day it is

640
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:31,039
an audit it really is an assessment to

641
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:33,049
see where you're at

642
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,700
and then based on that develop plans of

643
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:36,980
action and milestones for the

644
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:40,380
non-compliant controls how are you going

645
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:43,140
to make your system compliance

646
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,090
as I said there's a hundred and ten Kui

647
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,340
controls when you get down to the

648
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:49,939
determine tips it jumps up to five

649
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:54,199
hundred and sixty so there's a lot of

650
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:54,200
determine if that you have to answer

651
00:30:54,830 --> 00:31:00,539
remediate mitigate and compensate so

652
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:03,120
either fix it you find something worth

653
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:07,020
that mitigates that control our

654
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,719
compensates that control got to have an

655
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:12,900
incident reporting process and don't

656
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:16,970
forget if you have to make sure you mark

657
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:20,400
your Kui information so here's the risk

658
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:23,400
all I talked about this and the

659
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:26,549
interesting thing about this is sorry my

660
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:28,230
voice is going that's what happens when

661
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:30,210
you sit at a booth and talk to people

662
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:37,440
all day by the end of the day your voice

663
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:40,110
starts going so if your government

664
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,789
contractor you definitely have to comply

665
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:45,840
with this what would happen if you don't

666
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:49,100
government could say you're no longer

667
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,959
getting a contract at the very least

668
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,610
they could put you on a list of dabei in

669
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,720
your organization for bidding on future

670
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:59,939
contracts they could actually find you

671
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:03,179
now some of this hasn't quite happened

672
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:05,460
yet some of this has happened where they

673
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:06,780
said you guys have to comply tell us how

674
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:10,980
you're gonna comply it tell us when

675
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:12,450
you're gonna comply I know DoD came out

676
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,850
and said they're really gonna start

677
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:16,530
cracking down on their vendors their

678
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:19,500
contractors to ensure that they're

679
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:21,658
complying with this so if you're a DoD

680
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:24,539
contractor if you work for companies

681
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:27,630
like Boeing or Lockheed Martin or

682
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:29,970
General Dynamics you deal with with the

683
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:31,500
federal government all the time more

684
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:38,250
than likely you already have a program

685
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:40,679
in place if you are a smaller agency say

686
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:42,390
you're a contractor that you'll provide

687
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:46,350
anything to them you just provide

688
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:49,140
services you have to comply I work for a

689
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:50,549
government contractor and we had to

690
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,409
comply we had to go through a whole

691
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:53,400
process to ensure that we comply with

692
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:55,650
this

693
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:58,800
so subcontractors if you're a

694
00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:01,260
subcontractor and here's where it gets

695
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,610
complicated so the contractors dealing

696
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,650
directly with the government the

697
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:07,439
government will say yes you have to

698
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,940
comply okay you got a plan to comply

699
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,670
let's get into compliance

700
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:14,220
maybe you're gonna maybe get a small

701
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:16,800
fine but if your subcontractor your main

702
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:19,170
contractor so using Boeing is as an

703
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,919
example if you're developing widgets for

704
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:25,260
Boeing they could say how are you

705
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,700
complying oh you're not complying we're

706
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,220
going to pull your contract till you

707
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:31,140
comply I mean that's that's probably the

708
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,520
worst thing that a contractor you do and

709
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,860
if you're a small company and you have

710
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:38,490
you know maybe a 50 million dollars in

711
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:40,709
revenue and 7 8 9 10 million dollars is

712
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:42,450
tied up as a subcontractor with a

713
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:44,250
company like Boeing and they all of a

714
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,929
sudden say well you're not compliant you

715
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:48,030
can't show me you're compliant we're

716
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:49,530
gonna pull your contract now you're in

717
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,210
trouble now you're trying to struggle

718
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:53,580
and if you got exactly how you're going

719
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:55,410
to do this you're losing revenue means

720
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:57,300
you're losing income which means now you

721
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:59,940
have to have the expense of going forth

722
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:02,520
and complying with this which you know

723
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:07,320
what it's not that expensive but it's

724
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:09,540
not that cheap you know could cost you

725
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,219
anywhere from fifty to two hundred

726
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:13,290
thousand two hundred fifty thousand

727
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:14,908
dollars to get a contractor to comply

728
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:16,739
with it or you could try to comply

729
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:18,240
internally which means you're gonna

730
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:21,658
spend the same money but it's going to

731
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:24,120
be kind of hidden within things there's

732
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:25,820
other downstream organizations you may

733
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,659
be an organization that deals with a

734
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,550
subcontractor the deals with a federal

735
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:31,679
contractor you may not even know that

736
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:33,179
you have to comply with this until

737
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,980
somebody comes knocking on the door and

738
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:37,470
then you could you could be in a lot of

739
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:41,010
trouble the last one other companies

740
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:42,689
doing business in the United States you

741
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:45,510
may not even know you have to comply and

742
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:48,330
I'm going to use the tax companies just

743
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:53,580
just as an example that is it from my

744
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:56,639
own mind so your company you do taxes

745
00:34:53,580 --> 00:35:01,110
and you have a dispute with the IRS and

746
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:03,630
they hire agent says oh you're not doing

747
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:06,700
these people's taxes correctly and so

748
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:10,270
the you have a there's

749
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:12,189
loss of you have litigation you go forth

750
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:13,839
get lawyers involved spend a lot of

751
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:17,410
money and you one win the litigation

752
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:18,578
that our IRS agent that push the

753
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,140
litigation what do you think's gonna

754
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:22,180
what do you think house how do you think

755
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:24,089
he's gonna feel or she's gonna feel what

756
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:26,440
do you think they're gonna be thinking

757
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:28,810
and that could be happy that they pushed

758
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:32,290
this and they lost the case so they're

759
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:35,859
come back to you and say hey how are you

760
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:36,730
guys complying with 171 a I don't know

761
00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:37,930
never heard of it

762
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:39,670
well you never heard of that that's your

763
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:42,990
problem now we're gonna you know go

764
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:45,640
after you come after you with this so

765
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:47,410
it's going to happen somebody somewhere

766
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,879
is going to say how is your company

767
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:50,920
complying with this if they haven't

768
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:58,480
complied already and they're going to

769
00:35:50,920 --> 00:36:00,579
come after you and these just lists of

770
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,589
things that could happen all the way

771
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:09,460
from termination to crop contract down

772
00:36:02,589 --> 00:36:10,720
to criminal liability questions got

773
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:19,540
about 15 minutes left

774
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:29,560
questions way back there I can't hear

775
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:31,359
you sorry I haven't seen I've heard bits

776
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,279
and pieces especially on the sub

777
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,020
contractor to contractor basis where

778
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,490
they've actually said hey you have to

779
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,770
comply

780
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:42,250
tell us how you how you're going to

781
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:44,020
comply with this and if you not going to

782
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:48,430
comply with this we can no longer deal

783
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:50,560
with you working with a company in the

784
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:51,940
health care space right now that they're

785
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,099
a smaller company they're dealing with

786
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:56,079
one of the big large insurance companies

787
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:59,230
that insurance company came to them they

788
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,750
actually came to them beginning of 2018

789
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:04,300
said you have to comply with this so

790
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:06,849
this company instead of going down the

791
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:11,079
path with 171 a which wasn't around

792
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:13,290
beginning of 2018 they went with zero 53

793
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:15,819
so now they're stuck looking at those

794
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:18,040
650 controls to see how they're

795
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:19,420
complying with it and I actually just

796
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,200
got involved with this company earlier

797
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,450
this year

798
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,819
say okay you're going through this whole

799
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:27,520
list which means they've categorized all

800
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,890
their system as high so their systems

801
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,690
are high they didn't need to do that

802
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:33,190
they could have said it was moderate

803
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:36,670
because most of their systems are really

804
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:39,280
moderate according to tips 200 so I've

805
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:42,490
seen limited but it's like a snowball

806
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,230
it's coming five years from now a year

807
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:50,399
from now who knows how quickly it's

808
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:50,400
going to come so any other questions

809
00:37:50,970 --> 00:38:01,240
nope you know as a consultant I'd like

810
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:03,010
to say no you have to come to me but

811
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,540
realistically it can be yourself at the

812
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:18,700
station you can you can go through it to

813
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:26,950
yourself so that's a good question I

814
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:28,810
don't know yeah I haven't yeah I haven't

815
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:32,259
seen where there's any exemptions like

816
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:34,900
that but I mean dog gets into risk if

817
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:37,960
you're if you're one guy and maybe

818
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:39,640
you're providing you know milk to a

819
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,119
couple local stores around your farm

820
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:44,740
because you have ten cows I don't know

821
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:47,740
you know what's the risk you know you

822
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:49,240
run the risk of getting caught but

823
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,069
realistically I don't think they're

824
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,439
going to go after the big guys it's like

825
00:38:51,069 --> 00:38:55,839
like gdpr

826
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,190
so when I talk about GE PR when I give

827
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,410
people advice on gdpr

828
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:01,240
it's you know you're a small company

829
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:05,230
yeah you're dealing you're you're in

830
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:07,180
Europe you're doing this stuff comply

831
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:09,130
the best you can make sure you have a

832
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,540
privacy policy make sure it's posted

833
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:13,900
make sure you let everybody know what's

834
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:16,089
going on but wait and look and see what

835
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:18,339
happens to the big guys you know the

836
00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:21,819
googles the Facebook everything wait

837
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:24,160
wait the litigation hits now even with

838
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:25,900
that you're not protected somebody could

839
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,848
say hey you have to comply

840
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,920
why aren't you complying let's go

841
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:31,990
through this process and then the dairy

842
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,760
farmer sits down with the 171

843
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:35,709
looks at those 560

844
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,990
questions determine house goes through

845
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:39,520
them and say you know what this doesn't

846
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:41,589
apply this does apply that's not select

847
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,530
and not select you oh geez you know what

848
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:46,480
yeah you do have an online system who

849
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:48,610
has access to it well I have access to

850
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,770
it my wife has access to it so we've set

851
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:55,720
up the proper access controls so it's

852
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:58,330
when you first think about it look at it

853
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:01,089
it may seem like a daunting task but

854
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:05,009
it's really not that daunting as you you

855
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:05,010
know take pieces other chunks of it so

856
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:13,240
anybody else speak up cuz I'm I'm kind

857
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:57,040
of going deaf you know when you get old

858
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:59,020
you go deaf so you know I actually have

859
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,860
that question because when they updated

860
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:05,560
the last update to 171 was last June and

861
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:07,060
at the time where those fourth that

862
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:10,960
slide the handles four things you got to

863
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:16,210
comply with the tips 199 the 5200 the

864
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:18,280
853 and then the 860 they didn't take

865
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:21,370
that line out when they came out with

866
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:23,110
the 171 but they're pointing to the 171

867
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:26,440
saying you have to comply with

868
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:30,550
I'm sorry not 171 171 a they're saying

869
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:33,100
you have to comply with 171 a so as far

870
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:35,680
as I'm concerned way I advise folks is

871
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:38,049
you no longer have to look at the 53 you

872
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,419
got to go to the 171 a that's what you

873
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:43,270
should comply with and I can't see

874
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:46,930
anybody who's saying okay you complied

875
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:47,740
with 171 a but you didn't do 53 which 53

876
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:49,868
is spelled out

877
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:52,299
171 why didn't you comply with that well

878
00:41:49,869 --> 00:42:23,580
because there's a there's an a now that

879
00:41:52,300 --> 00:42:23,580
makes sense now nothing that I've seen

880
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:33,790
not necessarily I would go through the

881
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:35,680
exercise I would go through the exercise

882
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:38,230
I would dump all of this into a

883
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,169
spreadsheet and I'd say this is how I

884
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:43,480
comply with this because if you don't

885
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:46,030
you could say I'm compliant with PCI

886
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,250
I've got my rock and here's how I'm

887
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:50,650
compliant somebody could say we don't

888
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:55,390
care about PCI show us the document that

889
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:57,220
says 171 a on there I mean it's it's it

890
00:42:55,390 --> 00:43:00,368
seems like okay I'm doing double the

891
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:05,618
work and you really are but you know

892
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:08,320
you're covering yourself well yeah yeah

893
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:10,359
so it's so if you're compliant and

894
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,100
there's mappings there's everybody's

895
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:14,440
done mapping is tons of mappings out

896
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:16,830
there so if you if you get the mapping

897
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:20,500
and you say okay here's the PCI control

898
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:22,630
from the DSS and here's the misc control

899
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,850
that I need to comply with Bob there's

900
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:26,890
there's almost a perfect match match

901
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,310
there here's how I comply with it you've

902
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:29,950
got it

903
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:32,340
you know so it's not it's not that big

904
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:34,779
of a stretch it may be a paper exercise

905
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:36,580
you know and you know what you may come

906
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:38,260
up with one or two items that it's like

907
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:42,369
well you know what we never considered

908
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:44,910
this it's not necessarily in PCI so yeah

909
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,910
so we're really

910
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:52,790
I'd no no yeah yeah as I looked through

911
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:54,890
this you know it's like 10 years ago

912
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:59,810
when I started going down the path of

913
00:43:54,890 --> 00:44:01,430
getting found at 53 the company that I

914
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:03,470
was dealing with said tell me your

915
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:05,029
experience and I kind of I kind of

916
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:07,339
danced around that question because I

917
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:09,380
had never been a federal contractor you

918
00:44:07,339 --> 00:44:11,420
know as we all do in interviews right

919
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,250
you don't know something you say I don't

920
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:15,740
know I kind of knew it I kind of knew

921
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:17,210
what 53 was and I went to 53 for certain

922
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:20,419
audit programs I had developed in the

923
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:22,970
past but I didn't know exactly

924
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:25,609
everything that was involved in doing

925
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:26,930
and it really goes into the FISMA the

926
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:30,890
federal information security management

927
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:32,149
our Modernization Act I really didn't

928
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:34,359
know everything that went into it but I

929
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:34,359
could

930
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:53,200
today yes access control way they talk

931
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:55,130
about access control family in 1853

932
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,609
there's something similar to what I've

933
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:59,569
done

934
00:44:55,609 --> 00:45:01,308
it Maps tacko but it mapped ISO maps to

935
00:44:59,569 --> 00:45:03,470
the DSS there may be one or two things

936
00:45:01,309 --> 00:45:05,119
that are that are different but for the

937
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:09,740
most part you're gonna be covered it's

938
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:20,300
just going to that paper exercise any

939
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:23,479
other questions I'm sorry I can't hear

940
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:35,440
you they should give you a microphone we

941
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:46,250
got a microphone what business do you do

942
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:53,780
so do you have to comply with ITAR sorry

943
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:56,150
your manufacturer I mean you know you

944
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:59,839
you probably don't necessarily have to

945
00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:02,569
comply with it but to be honest with you

946
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:05,779
if you go through this you go through

947
00:46:02,569 --> 00:46:07,579
the assessment piece it's a good thing

948
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:09,339
to do even if you don't have to comply

949
00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:12,020
with it it's a good it's a good

950
00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:14,180
judgement and I actually like the NIST

951
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:17,589
documents and the way they're laid out

952
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:22,009
better than a lot of the other guidance

953
00:46:17,589 --> 00:46:24,710
that I've done like COBIT or ISO because

954
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:26,510
it gives you that control statement at a

955
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:28,970
higher level this one actually goes in

956
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:32,660
and tells you those determine if zigzag

957
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:34,308
what questions to ask so I mean even if

958
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,839
your company doesn't comply with it

959
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:37,490
doesn't need to comply with it doesn't

960
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:40,009
need to look at it it's always good to

961
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:45,410
look at and ensure that you know make

962
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:48,010
sure you're compliant with it so the

963
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:48,009
other questions
