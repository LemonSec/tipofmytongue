00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,620
again with that said before I begin and

4
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:17,310
I want to read a statement that I've

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,439
prepared so with that said I should be

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,259
in LA today speaking at another InfoSec

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,670
comments instead I took today off flew

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,619
all the way out here to st. Louis and

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,890
I'm speaking at an impost that

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:31,198
conference I did submit this talk on

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,090
behalf of myself independent of my

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,899
employer who happens to be here today as

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,690
a sponsor so I apologize to my employers

14
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,820
in advance let's see so with that said

15
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,089
the statements today are on my own

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,930
behalf

17
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,930
not on my employer

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:54,010
are we getting feedback on that mic all

19
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:55,570
right and we turn this one off so first

20
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,089
lesson of today's talk is about

21
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:02,110
microphone management all right

22
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:04,300
can y'all hear me now no feedback still

23
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,150
a little bit of feedback all right so

24
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,440
with that said you guys see the

25
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,729
disclaimer here there is a little bit of

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,990
bad language

27
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:17,229
it's nothing graphic or anything all

28
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:19,449
right so also it won't hurt my feelings

29
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:21,820
if you walk out this wouldn't be the

30
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,350
first and won't be the last so with that

31
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,300
said let's see

32
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,940
I would like to shake this thang show-me

33
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:30,039

34
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,410

this talk I'm not gonna be discussing

39
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:42,820
anything new or groundbreaking this is

40
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,610
just old stuff this is stuff that you

41
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:48,339
see in your environments to this day so

42
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,950
my goal here for today is really to fill

43
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,509
the your attention for the allotted time

44
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,250
to make you laugh a couple of times and

45
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:56,830
maybe you'll learn a thing or two that's

46
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,780
really the goal here today so with that

47
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,880
said I've got about a 40 45 minute talk

48
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,649
and I've got 63 slides and the slides

49
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,348
about are it's about a one gig

50
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:06,039
PowerPoint presentation so with that

51
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:08,470
we'll get started

52
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:13,180
Oh last thing today happens to be my

53
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:14,859
birthday so yeah so I will be at the bar

54
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,230

55
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:20,200
to buy me a drink alright so let's get

56
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,790
started this is talk is confessions of

57
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,290
really bad systems administrators we're

58
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,590
gonna kind of learn from the mistakes of

59
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:28,209
me and many of my peers so I was

60
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,580
mentioning this earlier I'm basically

61
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:32,860
committing like career hari-kari on

62
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,890
stage so this either is going to be very

63
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,720
successful or I don't know the real

64
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,700
title of today's talk is really

65
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,349
confessions of a shitty sis admins

66
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,369
there's a theme here and hopefully

67
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:45,849
you'll kind of see where we're going

68
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,440
here so a little bit about myself I work

69
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:48,720
for

70
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,609
cyber-ark software I have the coolest

71
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,100
job in the entire company I'm not a

72
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,530
sales guy I'm not a tech guy I simply

73
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,630
help people so I'm helping partners I'm

74
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,590
helping existing customers guys internal

75
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,450

I've run what's called our office of

77
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,619
programs I really have no clue what it

78
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,480
is but my job is generally I just help

79
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,920
people for a living I have a degree from

80
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,560

86
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,090

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,070
on and on and I'm really happy to say

105
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,920
I'm part of this really active and

106
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:09,780
vibrant community I personally am on

107
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,609
known as in the community as the travel

108
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,170
hacker now I'm not like chris Roberts

109
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,930
hacking your plans out of the sky or

110
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:17,640
anything what we've me and my wife do is

111
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,500
though we get really really cheap

112
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,310
airfare and travel all over the world

113
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:26,730
for like a shoestring budget let's see I

114
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:29,850
went to Australia for 11 days I think we

115
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:31,860
spent $3,500 for that total we did a

116
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:35,460
Easter Island for again nothing nine

117
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:38,340
days for cost like 1,100 and just

118
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,140
recently like literally like 48 hours

119
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,359
ago I just got back from Liberia Costa

120
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:45,570
Rica we spent five days there and

121
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,810
including food airfare lodging at this

122
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,150
resort I think we pay

123
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,410
700 bucks for the four of us so if you

124
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,638
want to learn more about travel hacking

125
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,770
I'll be more than happy to talk to you

126
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:57,340
about that later but more than anything

127
00:04:53,770 --> 00:05:00,280
beyond all that I was a former shitty

128
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,500
sysadmin all right so before I even buy

129
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,419
was a shitty sysadmin I was just shitty

130
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,970
helpdesk agent and this really where I

131
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:08,169
learned a lot of the mistakes and the

132
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,540
Phil pause that I've made in my career

133
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:11,859
and hopefully you've seen these in the

134
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,800
past and hopefully won't commit these

135
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,180
again so this talk is unlike a lot of

136
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,490
the ones you've seen previously these

137
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,470
are kind of little visual cues that will

138
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,900
help me spur my memory and then tell you

139
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,960
some more stories okay so let's start

140
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,370
talking about helpdesk and the where we

141
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,680
started making our mistakes and that's

142
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,620
in the password I remember this very

143
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,450
clearly it was November 2004 George Bush

144
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,360
had just defeated John Kerry in the

145
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:38,740
election and the first password that we

146
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,770
were supposed to give out to Orion users

147
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:45,820
when we reset their password was close

148
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:47,430
now remember this is the fall of 2004 so

149
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,950
what would our password potentially be

150
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,600
fall 2004 you see the problem is is that

151
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,099
seasons change roughly around the same

152
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,990
time and it is your 90-day password

153
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,850
policy so I guarantee and that

154
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,470
organization where I was working there

155
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:02,950
still passwords out that are probably

156
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:05,050
like summer 2019 so again if you're an

157
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,729
attacker trying to spray an organization

158
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,590
using these default passwords was the

159
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:10,390
first thing I made as far as mistakes

160
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,849
now you've probably seen something

161
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:14,770
similar this in your social media you

162
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,120
know find out your Star Wars Sith name

163
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,500
or whatever by entering this celery of

164
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,539
information sharing it with your peers

165
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,580
you don't realize you're sharing all

166
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:23,560
this secret password reset information

167
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,219
potentially so just be aware of your

168
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,410
online presence along that same lines if

169
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,090
you know ed SCOTUS he literally wrote

170
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,960
the book on pentesting he has a great

171
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:36,760
story about disclosing sort of password

172
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,859
information he did it was talking about

173
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,930
a pen test where they just owned the

174
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,880
hell out of this superintendent of a

175
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,670
school district the way they positioned

176
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,409
it was they wrote an

177
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,030
interview as a schoolchild interviewing

178
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,740
the superintendent as if they were

179
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,940
writing a report so some of the

180
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,680
questions were what were your parents

181
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,450
names what was your first pet name

182
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,490
things like that and this guy totally

183
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,950
just spilled the beans so be careful of

184
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,930
what you're exposing to the public in

185
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,940
whatever you're doing

186
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,380
this is a kind of on the same lines of

187
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,940
password questions these these aren't

188
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,190
really security issues but I had to

189
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,660
share it with you where I worked at a

190
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,700
long time ago

191
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,620
we allowed our end users to create their

192
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,240
own secret questions and some of them

193
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,130
were just awesome so here's just one of

194
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,420
them this one guy was really cute and he

195
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,159
decided to play that he was hard of

196
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,780
hearing so we had to make the person on

197
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,940
the other end to repeat the question

198
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,229
over and over again starting really

199
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,390
quiet until the point where basically

200
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,850
their addition yelling the question so

201
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:32,460
what was a good question that would just

202
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:35,100
really make a datacenter just die

203
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:38,039
laughing well this was what it was

204
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,510
who's your daddy so the person was like

205
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,220
what I'm sorry I don't hear and so the

206
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:43,440
person the helpdesk person was basically

207
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,650
screaming because your daddy before the

208
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,210
end of the day and the answer was me now

209
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,340
this is another one this guy wasn't just

210
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:53,280
real creep but I swear this is this

211
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,020
really is the his question the question

212
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,710
that he came up was what are you wearing

213
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:00,510
right now and yeah but it gets even

214
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,219
better and I swear I by the way if you

215
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,500
haven't figured this out I'd love stupid

216
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,690
just an animated ug animated gifs and

217
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,750
memes okay so that's basically what this

218
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:11,219
whole presentation is so I found a Jeff

219
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,870
and it was the best one because it

220
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,580
literally was his answer all right so

221
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,730
the answer the question is is weren't

222
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:20,490
you wearing right now that is totally

223
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:23,190
inappropriate so that was actually as an

224
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,140
answer so anyway but the point here is

225
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,280
is that you need to be careful of the

226
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,840
questions that you're disclosing if

227
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,479
they're easily being able to disclose

228
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,770
probably not good security questions all

229
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,900
right so I'm gonna move forward to

230
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:37,228
actual real confessions and things where

231
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:39,569
I see security being prevalent here the

232
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:40,260
first is the concept of TLS three-letter

233
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,270
acronyms

234
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,790
if y'all familiar with that right it's

235
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:47,310
we're in security we it's all about TAS

236
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,469
the first one I want to introduce is the

237
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,890
topic of an SLA does anybody know what

238
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:55,020
an SLA is service level agreement right

239
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,880
this is the metric in which contracts

240
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,280
are defined if you don't meet your

241
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,439
la then you haven't done your job right

242
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,390
well when I was in helpdesk

243
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,760
we were measured by another TLA this

244
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:09,000
one's called an f CR anybody know what f

245
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,810
CR is first call resolution that's

246
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,940
exactly right

247
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,589
as a support desk person just picking up

248
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,750
the phone I was expected to resolve

249
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,000
every call that I came across to a

250
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,370
certain threshold what percentage do you

251
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,210
think average run-of-the-mill support

252
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,630
desk person should maintain 25 good good

253
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,350
number

254
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:31,140
anybody else 40 you know when when I was

255
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,940
doing this RFC our ratio was 90% we had

256
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,640
to close 90 percent of our calls the

257
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,680
first time they call so think about this

258
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,120
from a social engineering perspective if

259
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,219
I don't get the answer I want from the

260
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,810
person on the end of the phone I had the

261
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,600
longer I keep them on the line the less

262
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:47,489
their Ser rate drops so you really the

263
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,050
person supporting you really wants to

264
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,910
get the call done as quickly as possible

265
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,560
so if it doesn't work you just call back

266
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,569
and the chances are getting what you

267
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,510
want as a social engineer it's pretty

268
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,940
good so again knowing that the end user

269
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,980
this the support agent has to maintain

270
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,890
this like high threshold of call

271
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:07,410
frequency presents some security risk in

272
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,480
lieu of operations all right so this is

273
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:12,180
really where I started losing my taste

274
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,220
for Humanity and progressed up the ranks

275
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,890
of a helpdesk I went from helpdesk 1 to

276
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:20,370
2 to team lead and ultimately I became a

277
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:22,260
sysadmin this is really where I think we

278
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,690
learned a lot of our security mistakes I

279
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,640
became that the master to prod really

280
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,560
who controlled the keys to the kingdom

281
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,810
right and this is where I was introduced

282
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,689
to the three envelopes that have saved

283
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:36,060
my career time and time again I'm gonna

284
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,650
teach you this strategy over the course

285
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,500
of today's talk and hopefully this will

286
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:42,810
save your careers as well all right what

287
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,760
you see in a lot of IT organizations is

288
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,979
there's lots of players in them in the

289
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:51,050
in the organization and we all have a

290
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:53,780
common view of systems administrators

291
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:56,719
yeah we're not too highly looked upon

292
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:58,670
except for maybe ourselves right you'll

293
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,960
see that you know that we're not highly

294
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,420
looked upon because we have certain

295
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,730
things that we value above all others

296
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:07,160
and if you're not familiar with xkcd

297
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,720
these guys make amazing comics and

298
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,920
they're so true to life in this one

299
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,540
right here we're talking about a

300
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,510
sysadmin what do they give it what do

301
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,160
they care about its uptime right it's

302
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,740
all about uptime when it comes to

303
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,390
systems administrators now we're all

304
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,270
security professionals here I hope you

305
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:24,530
all are familiar with it the CIA triad

306
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:26,120
come on let's let's all say it together

307
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:29,150
it's confidentiality integrity

308
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,250
availability right when it comes to

309
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:33,860
systems administration not security they

310
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,250
operate on a whole different triad all

311
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,010
right

312
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,810
y'all familiar with the AAA triad nobody

313
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:41,270
all about availability availability

314
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:43,250
availability availability that's what

315
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,530
they're concerned about and so my point

316
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,000
here is is as systems administrators

317
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,500
people think of us as you know we know

318
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,390
all the answers we're the technical

319
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,980
folks but in all honesty we're really

320
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,300
just treading water we're trying to keep

321
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,430
our head above the ground and just keep

322
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:59,209
the systems running however the hell we

323
00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:01,579
do it right so when you saw my intro

324
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:03,800
slide you saw my my hacker handle it's a

325
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,930
Rainmaker and I'm not really that fond

326
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,060
of it but I really believe that the best

327
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:10,790
hacker handles are given not chosen and

328
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,530
that one was actually bestowed upon me

329
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,969
most people think the Rainmaker that's

330
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:17,209
like money money dollar dollar whatever

331
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:20,300
no it's more the traditional term the

332
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:24,020
the Native American rain dance to save

333
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,939
the day and the my VP at the time gave

334
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,660
me the term and a Rainmaker and I never

335
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,940
went away

336
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:31,550
basically we to date I did a datacenter

337
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:34,370
move and our whole network did not come

338
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:36,349
over like it was supposed to production

339
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,480
now it is across the board and somehow I

340
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,460
got it up and working

341
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,260
thus I got the term Rainmaker I have no

342
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,630
idea what the hell I did to get it up

343
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,520
it's running online but hey but that's

344
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,290
why all the names stuck so one of the

345
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,610
lessons learned today is when you're

346
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,260
making changes on a production

347
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,490
environment don't do multiple ones at

348
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,350
the same time because you can't

349
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:56,300
attribute one to actually correcting the

350
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:59,420
issue make changes very scientifically

351
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,579
ok all right so let's get started and

352
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,270
start talking about some of the security

353
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,090
mistakes that we made

354
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:07,199
that I've seen and have done in the past

355
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,790
if you look at my LinkedIn you can

356
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,940
probably see a couple of the companies

357
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:14,219
and we fixed these problems since then

358
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,770
but for example I used to work for a

359
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,840
very large chain of restaurants and we

360
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,980
had to go our grand opening we were

361
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,830
doing the whole ribbon cutting for the

362
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:25,020
Chamber of Commerce and the problem was

363
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:27,000
is there was only one wireless network

364
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,340
that riderless network was reserved for

365
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,970
the point-of-sale for our servers and

366
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:35,040
for our corporate IT network

367
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:37,080
unfortunately this the owner of the

368
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,839
company one-a-day public facing Wi-Fi

369
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,150
for our customers so when you only have

370
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:45,150
budget for one what do you do

371
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:48,360
you shouldn't expose it to the end-users

372
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:51,270
right that's exactly what we did so I

373
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,070
hate to say that but there's situations

374
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:55,530
where we cut corners for the sake of

375
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:58,110
operations we had to give it a open to

376
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:00,060
the users thank god another buddy

377
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,410
breached it before we actually corrected

378
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,150
the problem but again it's cutting

379
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,310
corners and that's really what's the the

380
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:07,079
crux of the problem here which leads me

381
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,880
to kind of some other things we were

382
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,390
gonna talk about circumventing of

383
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,770
controls all right you see that just

384
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,000
because you have a control in place

385
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,430
doesn't mean people are actually using

386
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,450
it and this is really prevalent when we

387
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,189
start talking about systems

388
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:22,290
administrators because we're the ones

389
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:24,570
installing those sorts of things we know

390
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,740
exactly how to circumvent them and so

391
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,840
again these are some of the mistakes

392
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,390
that I've seen done and done some of

393
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:33,720
these myself I mentioned earlier

394
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:36,240
November of 2004 this was also the same

395
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,460
time that World of Warcraft they you

396
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,320
know the the vanilla version went live

397
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,210
that was that was the big one right it

398
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,590
is anybody gonna play the new vanilla

399
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:46,350
version that's coming out or has it

400
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:48,030
already come out August okay

401
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,460
well I'm totally gonna be into that so

402
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:52,319
look me up later but the problem is is

403
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:55,260
back in 2004 I was working the night

404
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,120
shift and well I needed to do my molding

405
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,530
for more than the multicore 40 man raids

406
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,790
so what do you do when you're working

407
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,430
the night shift you bring your laptop

408
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,140
into work yeah that's the sort of the

409
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:06,599
circumventing of controls either that

410
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,519
were talking about what we've seen in

411
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,649
or common terms now we've done you know

412
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,209
Hardware filtering is is rather than

413
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:14,370
bringing hardware and data into

414
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:17,069
organizations we're seeing users take

415
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:19,380
data out quite often our security

416
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:21,300
controls are so harsh that it's

417
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:23,250
preventing our end users to do their job

418
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,899
and so they're taking their data and

419
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,089
they're maybe chained only get out

420
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,560
through Skype or slacks so people can

421
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:30,750
they can access their files and their

422
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,910
personal devices circumvent any sort of

423
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,800
caz B's and things like that so just be

424
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,529
aware that you know maybe these controls

425
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,689
are maybe too powerful and that's

426
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:42,269
introducing even more risk this one here

427
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:44,220
this one was a fun one company decided

428
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:46,139
to get wise and install content

429
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,630
monitoring so you know seeing what our

430
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:52,589
employees are doing they also allowed

431
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:54,180
outbound SSH so a simple sysadmin who

432
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:55,440
doesn't want the company to know what

433
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,079
they're doing can create and outbound

434
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,269
socks proxy to their AWS instance or

435
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,920
raspberry pi at home and completely

436
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:03,480
circumvent the filtering from your

437
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,009
company these are the sort of things

438
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,300
that your sis admissions are doing

439
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:08,190
because we're giving them admin access

440
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,560
to do you know whatever on their own

441
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:13,230
personal on their their assets on their

442
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,849
computer so again probably the people

443
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,779
that are installing these controls are

444
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,630
also the same ones that are

445
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:21,990
circumventing them another one this one

446
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:24,779
was pretty funny I hate my keys I am the

447
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,130
most forgetful person I tell people that

448
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:29,430
I have the short-term memory of a

449
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:31,829
goldfish and it's probably true I forget

450
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:34,380
my keys with my key fob all the time and

451
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:36,899
so what we would end up doing is because

452
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:39,120
of network segmentation we would allow

453
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:41,490
for multi-factor to access our PCI

454
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,259
environment at the time rather than

455
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:46,560
having to use my key fob to give it and

456
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:48,389
I happen to also be the VMware admin so

457
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,459
we just jump on vCenter get console

458
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:52,500
access completely circumventing the MFA

459
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:54,268
those are some of the controls that we

460
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,220
got to talk about and that's what we

461
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:58,380
have to do is watch and monitor our

462
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,569
systems admins because they're gints are

463
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,850
committing the controls we put in

464
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:05,730
another one here is we're lazy

465
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,339
that's how why we got into technology so

466
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:11,099
all machines can do the work for us many

467
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:13,859
a time have I set a job off and walked

468
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,099
away with the computer unlocked that

469
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:16,689
that happens more than

470
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:18,699
then I would like to admit in the past

471
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:21,580
so what we ended up doing was we created

472
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,020
a distribution list called donut and I

473
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:24,369
love this and this is such a simple

474
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,440
thing because it game if I as the

475
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:28,659
process if you happen to find a machine

476
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,670
that's unlocked and you're able to send

477
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,650
an email from that user to this

478
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,140
distribution list they're obligated to

479
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,850
bring Donuts in the next day yes if

480
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,340
you've ever wanted to see a grown man

481
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:41,110
clear three cubes in like rapid

482
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:44,290
succession to get to his unlocked

483
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:46,750
computer that's how to do it so what the

484
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:48,580
also here you can see from our lazy

485
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,920
sysadmin is you know the machines

486
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:54,060
unlocked this is something that again I

487
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:57,040
now that I'm I've learned and you know

488
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,720
recovered from my mistakes I used to let

489
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:02,020
vendors come into my network

490
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,960
unencumbered we might monitor them for a

491
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,160
little bit you know set up a go to my PC

492
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,860
session so they could get into the

493
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,690
systems but was the sysadmin actually

494
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,149
watching him now it's probably having a

495
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:15,250
smoke break or talking to Sally in

496
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:17,200
accounting the point being is is I

497
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,120
wasn't watching our vendors and our

498
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,890
third parties accessing our systems and

499
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,530
just exposing our organization to who

500
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:26,050
knows what same thing is applicable with

501
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:28,540
us well they target their breach came

502
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:31,659
from an external vendor so be exposing

503
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:35,649
our vendors to our network unsecured Lea

504
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:37,420
is not entirely the best also this one

505
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:40,210
you see that the forest and the tree

506
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:42,510
here right this kind of teaches me our

507
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:45,760
Tala tells me about responding to alerts

508
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:48,370
one of my jobs previously was a tripwire

509
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,930
responder and responding to the alerts

510
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,209
that came in and there were just so many

511
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:54,660
so what did we do because we had just so

512
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,980
many alerts we just ignored the hallo

513
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,970
that the problem is you can't see the

514
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,520
forest through the trees we were

515
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,260
tripping over ourselves so pay attention

516
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,730
to the alerts tune them down because

517
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,040
otherwise you're just getting a bunch of

518
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:08,250
crap and there's no value in it so - and

519
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,389
you're tuned your logs and make sure

520
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:12,280
let's move forward I think this video

521
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,690
will play I don't know if the audio will

522
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,120
but you can probably get the gist of

523
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,580
this anybody watch Saturday Night Live

524
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,969
anybody know who this is Nick burns your

525
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,649
company's computer guy so in the process

526
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,690
of being assist admin not only was i

527
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,700
jegg a gigantic asshole to my customers

528
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,860
like Nick

529
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,330
you'll notice that Knicks logging on to

530
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:34,350
the machine on behalf of the user

531
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:36,090
remember mmm yeah what he's doing is and

532
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,310
the circumstance is you know putting in

533
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,959
his own password potentially and so now

534
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,550
that I've learned about this what he

535
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,710
should have done is after you know

536
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,510
messing with Jennifer's computer here

537
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,880
rebooting making sure that you know

538
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:51,060
Nick's MIT credentials aren't stored in

539
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,980
memory so the point here is is be nice

540
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,659
to end-users and if you're going to log

541
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,390
onto a machine make sure that again

542
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,810
you're the ntlm to memory or I'm sorry

543
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:02,190
ntlm V to hash is stored in memory so

544
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:04,230
hypothetically saying Jennifer's machine

545
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,690
got like a keylogger or a ram scraper if

546
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:09,030
I go over her machine login to a machine

547
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,910
well now my creds are in her memory

548
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:14,310
exposing it so be aware of that all

549
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:17,040
right moving forward passwords you see

550
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,360
this is a password recycling here and

551
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,740
then an island of trash in the

552
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,419
background because that's what we're

553
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,760
doing here when we recycle passwords

554
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:27,990
it's trash there's a couple stories

555
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,510
around this one let's start here I have

556
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,910
an organization that I consult with and

557
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:35,610
they use the same password across

558
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:37,470
multiple different platforms what does

559
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:39,300
that mean exactly well it's an ad

560
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,250
account it's a very very highly

561
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,780
privileged account but it's running an

562
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:45,810
application running several service

563
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,970
accounts it's also running hard coded in

564
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:50,159
several different automated scripts it's

565
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:52,440
also running in their Linux environment

566
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,930
as well facilitating some ad bridging in

567
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,480
some processes the point being is is

568
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:59,430
this one a privileged account is bound

569
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,770
to like six different applications and

570
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:03,360
processes so let's say we Institute a

571
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,639
password policy where that password gets

572
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,520
rotated you know what happens nothing

573
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,350
there gets an exemption in your audit

574
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,450
policy and that password has never

575
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,189
changed what really needs to happen is

576
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,690
we need to make our credential

577
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:18,150
single-use making sure that they're

578
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:21,600
located and used for a single purpose

579
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,950
and a single purpose alone another story

580
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,560
I want to tell here - anybody know what

581
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:27,960
this movie says kangaroo jack it's a

582
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,580
terrible movie but this guy he was the

583
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,310
sysadmin that ran our UNIX team and this

584
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,740
was his icon on our I am client so this

585
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:37,190
reminds me of what he did

586
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:39,049
so compliance mandates in certain

587
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:41,690
organizations require you to rotate your

588
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:44,149
passwords and so this guy got smart he

589
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:45,440
got really smart he decided to send a

590
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:48,139
batch job that changed the password

591
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,270
across the enterprise so man main

592
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,159
maintaining the compliance but what he

593
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:54,289
didn't tell they come auditor was he

594
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,330
just ran that exact same batch job again

595
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:59,179
and reset the password right back to the

596
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:01,070
original so the says the password change

597
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:03,230
right on the logs auditors happy right

598
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:06,830
but did the password actually change now

599
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:09,350
did security change oh the point being

600
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:12,289
is quit reusing your passwords it's

601
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:13,820
really really a bad thing which leads me

602
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:16,490
to a really important point about

603
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,770
compliance compliance is a low watermark

604
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:21,279
when it comes to security it is the

605
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:24,230
minimum viable product across the board

606
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,640
however this is also probably the

607
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:27,919
biggest carrot on a stick for

608
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,470
organizations if you haven't followed

609
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,840
hermit hacker this is a personal friend

610
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:35,390
of mine and a really good guy and he

611
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,168
told me that using compliance as that

612
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,390
carrot on a stick

613
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:40,490
as far as motivating businesses to spend

614
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,679
money on technical and computer security

615
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:46,190
controls is how to go about doing it so

616
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:48,590
tying compliance to your your security

617
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:50,179
controls goes a very very long way so

618
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:51,559
I've shared with you a couple of the

619
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:53,510
mistakes that I have made I've

620
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:55,309
definitely made a few I'm gonna share

621
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,950
with you some mistakes that other people

622
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:59,720
have made okay we'll start outside of

623
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:01,130
the worlds of systems administration see

624
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,990
if you can pick up on this one anybody

625
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,360
know this this one all right let's let's

626
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,100
watch Kanye over here you don't need

627
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,510
audio for this one all right so take a

628
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,399
look at what he's doing he's showing

629
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:13,070
President Trump the new explain one I

630
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:16,250
believe oh you already saw it all right

631
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:18,710
hold on so he's showing the president

632
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:20,809
right here he he calls it a gift I'm

633
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:26,720
still stuck on Jeff it's Jeff for me I

634
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:31,428
show of hands is it Jeff gif oh did you

635
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:33,890
suck now but take a look zero zero zero

636
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:36,710
zero is his password and so that really

637
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:39,350
kind of shows me about default passwords

638
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,149
yes alright so this is a real confession

639
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,039
I actually had a system that I

640
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:44,658
maintained and I was the junior admin

641
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,999
and I was told to change the password

642
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:48,259
and my senior admin said no we can't

643
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:50,330
change the password we have to keep it

644
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:51,830
at the default I was like why it's like

645
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:54,980
so the vendor can get in when they need

646
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:56,570
to okay what the hell are you talking

647
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,340
about like much like dr. Phil here it's

648
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:01,460
just like one of those brain farts so

649
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:03,918
when it comes to passwords I need to

650
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,600
make a very good clear point guilfoyle

651
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,279
says it better than me if you're not

652
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,619
familiar with Silicon Valley I highly

653
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,210
highly recommend this show it's more

654
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:12,678
like what does they say it's not like

655
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:14,690
social engineering it's more like

656
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:17,659
natural selection right this is not

657
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:20,749
hacking here don't post your passwords

658
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:22,369
on notepad sticky notes things like that

659
00:24:20,749 --> 00:24:24,350
here's just a couple of the ones that I

660
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:27,350
found over the course of just visiting

661
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:28,789
clients and even more important if

662
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:31,998
you're gonna be on TV

663
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:34,190
holy cow do not put passwords in your

664
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:36,139
workplace all right worse yet just if

665
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:38,210
you're gonna be on TV don't have it done

666
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:40,219
on your work site be away from around

667
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,710
your machines maintain that clean desk

668
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,539
policy but yeah these are all just

669
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,659
people that have had passwords just

670
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:50,179
exposed because they left them on TV

671
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:52,070
crazy stuff right alright so let's talk

672
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:54,740
about Miss configuration if you think

673
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:56,480
about it there's more security incidents

674
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,669
due to Miss configuration than there are

675
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,009
security vulnerabilities there's way

676
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:03,110
more people installing applications than

677
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:04,490
actually developing them and so what

678
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,248
you're seeing here is Gartner says are

679
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:09,080
really good that 99 percent of cloud

680
00:25:07,249 --> 00:25:12,590
security failures will be the customers

681
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,999
fault by 2023 it's not the s3 that's

682
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,279
that's compromised it's the

683
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:17,210
configuration settings so we have to

684
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:19,009
make sure that we're doing our

685
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:21,320
deployments we're doing our work

686
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:23,869
diligently otherwise we're exposing our

687
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:26,658
applications to undue risk all right so

688
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:29,360
again it's their configuration that's

689
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:30,889
really the the scary part alright now

690
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,439
who here is familiar with truffle log

691
00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:36,740
this is a really cool tool that I want

692
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,169
to show a problem that many developers

693
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,700
make on a daily basis and it's a hard

694
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:43,429
coding your credentials into scripts

695
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,830
this is a just freely available tool up

696
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:48,050
on a github and what it does is it

697
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:51,129
recursively searches through the

698
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:53,690
commit histories of github submissions

699
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:55,040
what that does is you know if you put

700
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:57,800
your password in clear-text

701
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,780
by accident you make a change you submit

702
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,030
it if you don't remove it from your

703
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:04,220
revision history it's still just as good

704
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,990
there so I want to show you a couple

705
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,300
things before I begin and show you this

706
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:10,240
it's a true - case here all right so

707
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:13,040
this is github just from this morning

708
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,600
you can actually just search for

709
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,940
keywords and it will show you the most

710
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,889
recently indexed accounts and you can

711
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:23,690
see these are people's secret keys just

712
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:25,670
right out here and get up huh yes oh

713
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:29,929
sorry I'm not showing my screen thank

714
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:36,800
you let me a duplicate my screen here do

715
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:38,360
you do all right let's see here yep so

716
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,340
here's the github right here you can see

717
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,010
that this is just indexed recently and

718
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,899
people's secret keys are just exposed in

719
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:46,460
clear text here and if you want to

720
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:49,850
automate the finding of that this is

721
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:52,100
really where truffle hog is very helpful

722
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:54,320
so I created a script to make this a

723
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:59,000
little easier today let me see your si

724
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:01,189
desktop truffle hog - and I wanted to

725
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,910
show you this idiot that put all this

726
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:07,460
open light his SSH keys passwords all of

727
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:10,010
this stuff is in this morons github repo

728
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:12,890
I mean take a look at this all right

729
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:16,160
I'll scroll up here so you can see a

730
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:17,870
couple SSH keys private keys come on

731
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:21,110
scroll up damn it there we go

732
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:23,419
so yeah there's a secret there this is

733
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:25,219
all in one single github repo don't

734
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,540
worry these this is my github repo so

735
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,790
it's they're not actual real passwords

736
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:31,340
so yeah tough yeah it's not you're not

737
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:33,649
finding real passwords so but my point

738
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,780
is is that you know developers easily

739
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:38,270
put passwords in their scripts their

740
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:40,070
source code and it's very easy for an

741
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:42,020
attacker to find it all right so I'm

742
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:51,710
gonna switch back into presenter mode

743
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:54,429
and here let's see all right

744
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,429
Oh No

745
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:05,490
that's the last time I'm leaving the

746
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:10,080
screen here so we're good there all

747
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:13,020
right so there's all right all right so

748
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,570
let's keep moving forward we got mr. t

749
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:17,580
here talking about April Fool's this

750
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:19,649
this is a real story that happened in

751
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,689
one of my organizations well we had a

752
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:25,050
web developer that was let go and he was

753
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:26,700
not too happy about it so as one of the

754
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,889
last things he did before leaving the

755
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:32,370
organization was a planet a time bomb on

756
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:34,220
the e-commerce site so at some

757
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:36,479
predetermined time when he was long gone

758
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,820
lives like nine months after he loved

759
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,160
the time mom executed it just happened

760
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,960
to coincide with April Fool's so what

761
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:46,140
happened was is it was actually fairly

762
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,240
benign logic bomb it basically was a

763
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,200
JavaScript that inverted the screen so

764
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,860
it looked like you were looking at

765
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:55,140
everything upside down happened like I

766
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,760
said on April Fool's so what happened

767
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,440
was is the company played it off like it

768
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,330
was an April Fool's joke but in reality

769
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,120
InfoSec was running around with their

770
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:05,250
heads cut off freaking out so I thought

771
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,020
that was an interesting one nothing

772
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:09,060
really came about it but again this just

773
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:12,000
shows where you know potential risks

774
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:14,310
exist in your in your processes this one

775
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,400
here this was a good one I had a client

776
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:19,139
of mine that we were doing an assessment

777
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,910
of their privileged accounts what

778
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:23,630
cyber-ark does we work on privileged

779
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:25,830
accounts security so your most important

780
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:27,510
passwords like domain admin accounts

781
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,550
need to be managed really aggressively

782
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,110
and we found this domain admin account

783
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:33,540
it was a systems admin account that was

784
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:35,280
running a service and it wasn't just a

785
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:37,200
regular domain admin account it was the

786
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:40,200
guy in the room that was well I was

787
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,180
given the presentation too and let me

788
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,920
real quote him word for word I said I

789
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,240
think he said I'm not calling you a liar

790
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:49,530
I just don't believe a word you just

791
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:51,960
fucking said yeah that really makes you

792
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,639
scared right so I did what any rational

793
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,540
human being would do and when I showed

794
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,160
him that

795
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,560
fact that he was using his own account

796
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,570
to run this service I handed him the

797
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,490
HDMI controller and said let's log on to

798
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,320
the box and take a look oh it was

799
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:06,270
amazing within like ten seconds this guy

800
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,950
turns bright red redder than the guy

801
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:11,310
shirt in the back and it was awesome

802
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:12,990
he said I'm so sorry but the point is is

803
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,149
this guy was running you know service

804
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,530
accounts with his own admin account in

805
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,940
the event that these service accounts

806
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:20,040
are running that meant that those

807
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,060
credentials are stored in memory so in

808
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,230
the event that that machine was

809
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,639
compromised an attacker would have

810
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:26,820
access to his domain admin account

811
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,970
pretty scary stuff right now this is one

812
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:31,500
that I shouldn't have to tell you but

813
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:33,390
I'm gonna do it anyway you shouldn't be

814
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:36,330
surfing inappropriate content at work

815
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:38,370
right this goes this is a great story

816
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:42,240
because I get I get to shut somebody

817
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:44,159
down hard so on my one time I was

818
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,000
managing our sand storage and we were

819
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,250
about to put a

820
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,250
my Gration so we're cleaning up data and

821
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:52,560
I found a treasure trove of

822
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:55,680
inappropriate content what happened was

823
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:59,129
is one of the people on our team had a

824
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,750
really weird fetish but I digress he

825
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:02,610
happened to be storing all of it in his

826
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:05,280
My Documents folder on his corporate

827
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:07,110
issued laptop what he also didn't know

828
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,850
was that in My Documents folder was

829
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:11,879
being replicated back to our standard

830
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:13,439
for document retention purposes so what

831
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,350
he was into was getting synchronized

832
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,300
back to the files here we happened to

833
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:20,399
terminate that a couple years ago but

834
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,350
the data was still there and it was

835
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,690
still being backed up on a regular basis

836
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:27,230
which is how I discovered it so this was

837
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:30,330
the cool part so he accused me of

838
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:32,310
planting this you know contraband on in

839
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:34,470
his file share so be that he actually

840
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:37,980
started before me I was like okay bro

841
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:39,930
let's do this pick a day any day pick

842
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,450
one before I even started and let's

843
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:44,810
restore that file so he's no longer

844
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:47,280
there and I was so yeah

845
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:49,020
but my point being is is it I'm not

846
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,760
trying to can't shame anybody just keep

847
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,920
that stuff off your per your work

848
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:55,530
machine do that in your own time right

849
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,900
all right so I'm gonna kind of segue

850
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:59,370
into some things that we want to talk

851
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:01,710
about words that you shouldn't be using

852
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:04,139
in a professional context these are

853
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:05,700
things that I've seen people use some of

854
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:08,550
these are not a little mean they're not

855
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:12,420
bad but again I would advise you to try

856
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:14,399
to use different words ping ping in the

857
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:17,070
context of Technology is a beacon

858
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,080
waiting for a response in the terms of

859
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:21,720
business it doesn't necessarily mean

860
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,919
that it's morphing you say if you pink

861
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,000
somebody in accounting it's a lot

862
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,830
different than pinging somebody in

863
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,020
networking right they don't quite get it

864
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:30,780
all right another thing is is the term

865
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:32,550
to be honest I hate this term because

866
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:35,520
this implies at times you may not be

867
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:37,070
honest so just don't use this word you

868
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,750
know just again try not to use that

869
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:41,399
another one the the concept of burning

870
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,530
the ships that you know that's the hell

871
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,660
or high water we there's no going back

872
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:49,200
you guys familiar with where this term

873
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:50,940
originated from the conquistador days of

874
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,220
like seventeen sixteen hundred's

875
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:56,280
Coronado made it to the new world and

876
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:58,770
burned his ships so that the the his

877
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,570
soldiers had no recourse but to discover

878
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,680
the new land

879
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:04,230
you know what that never actually

880
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,810
happened there was no burning of ships

881
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:08,960
rather than burning of the ships

882
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:11,159
Coronado actually scuttled the ships he

883
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,110
programmatically broke down the timber

884
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,970
and the linen and all the resources of

885
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:19,169
the boats that's just stupid

886
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:20,790
so do things smart okay another term

887
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:23,040
that I want to talk about today is the

888
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:25,860
term brand jacking this is some

889
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,149
marketing mumbo jumbo it's the same

890
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:29,250
things that we've heard of time and time

891
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:32,010
again it's fishing right let's call a

892
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:33,840
spade a spade and not use divergent

893
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,480
terms because it all means the same

894
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,760
thing this is fishing another term that

895
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,290
really really gets me this grinds my

896
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,350
gears is the term open the kimono

897
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:45,570
anybody heard this one I don't like this

898
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:47,219
one this one you we see c-suite

899
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:48,990
executives just within the last couple

900
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,940
of years using this term this is a

901
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:53,190
reference to the historical times of

902
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:55,620
Japan where the geishas would you know

903
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:58,350
open their kimonos as a show of exposing

904
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:00,689
their naked bodies that's not the

905
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:02,340
intention of today's c-suites using this

906
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:04,890
term it's more of being transparent

907
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:07,080
honest and open with your transactions

908
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:10,200
without knowing the historical

909
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:12,779
connotations this really changes the

910
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:14,699
context of this phrase not only is this

911
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:17,220
sexist but it's racist and so again in

912
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:19,259
my opinion just best not use these sorts

913
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:21,449
of terms in the context of a business

914
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,400
discussion right another one that I

915
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:25,290
really want to talk on and I think this

916
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,130
is a really good opportunity to talk

917
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:31,770
about this is using the term hacking in

918
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:33,180
relative to criminal actions you know

919
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:35,250
what there's a lot of hackers in this

920
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:37,560
room today and none of you well I hope

921
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:39,900
none of you are legitimate criminals

922
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:43,259
hacking is not a crime you know this is

923
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:45,690
how we're finding these flaws and along

924
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:47,520
with the whole concept of the hacker and

925
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:49,590
the hoodie and the with the face mask

926
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,270
these aren't hackers then you want to

927
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:53,490
talk about what real hackers look like

928
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:55,050
these are real hackers well they may not

929
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:58,020
be this is a this is not a real person

930
00:34:55,050 --> 00:35:00,000
calm these are just computer-generated

931
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,440
people these are the criminals that we

932
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,310
need to be protecting not against these

933
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,750
sorts of folks you know so you've kind

934
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:08,640
of shared with you a bunch of the

935
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:11,310
terrible things that I've seen in my

936
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,509
past as a systems administrator I want

937
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,220
to share with you a couple of things

938
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:17,040
that are actually good things that you

939
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:19,799
can take away one was just using common

940
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,470
sense being able to really protect an

941
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,060
organization from ransomware somebody in

942
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,040
accounting really shouldn't be running

943
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:29,160
you know bash shell scripts or you know

944
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,960
VB ship scripts so disassociating that

945
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,420
type of extension to something like

946
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,280
WordPad and so is just a really easy way

947
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:38,910
to go about doing that and yes that is a

948
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,430
base64 Easter Egg there so another thing

949
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:44,330
that you can do is changing the default

950
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:46,649
installation path just going from C to D

951
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:48,690
what does that do from a security

952
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,040
perspective a lot of the script kiddie

953
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,230
tools are looking for default

954
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,029
installation path default registry

955
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:56,130
values things like that and so by just

956
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:58,050
deviating even something as small as

957
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,880
that you can actually break some of

958
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:01,830
these automated scripts now let's be

959
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,270
honest if we got an apt in the house and

960
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,160
they're actually doing byte by byte you

961
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,720
know file by file scans this

962
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,480
gonna help but if we're talking about

963
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,490
some script kiddie stuff yes this will

964
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,920
help also from a systems administration

965
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:15,569
perspective this will actually by

966
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,920
breaking out your OS volumes and your

967
00:36:15,569 --> 00:36:19,160
data volumes will actually shrink your

968
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,480
data backups too so it's a win-win

969
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:25,020
another thing is is that the personal

970
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,940
relationships in being in a career of a

971
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,740
systems administrator you can see these

972
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,599
are some guys I used to work with at

973
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:32,250
fossil that are now we've gone our

974
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,099
separate ways but you know I still run

975
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:36,180
across these guys as clients I'm not

976
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:38,250
gonna tell you where but this is a

977
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:41,788
government facility I mean that's crazy

978
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:43,349
right there's a these are my two best

979
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:47,400
friends we used to work together between

980
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:49,319
the three of us we have 17 girls yeah I

981
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,720
know there's like no y chromosomes that

982
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:52,799
were produced at all but these are some

983
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,660
of my best friends that I wouldn't have

984
00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:55,920
had if I didn't have a career as a

985
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,058
systems administrator and then we

986
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,970
wouldn't have the awkward hugs from

987
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:00,420
Jason - so by the way if you haven't got

988
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:02,459
a chance

989
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,930
Jason's do want to talk later tomorrow I

990
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,569
believe and it's gonna rock your socks

991
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:08,220
off so I want to give credit to him and

992
00:37:06,569 --> 00:37:10,349
also if you can see we can have fun on

993
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,240
the job - anybody seen American Psycho

994
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:14,789
yes so you get that reference right

995
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,410
there feed me a stray cat yeah so I

996
00:37:14,789 --> 00:37:17,579
changed all the payroll systems to say

997
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:20,970
feed me a straight cat for a day just

998
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:22,740
because I wanted to so I've kind of

999
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:25,770
talked about you know being a shitty

1000
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,868
Systems Administrator I really do

1001
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:30,210
believe that the shittiest of systems

1002
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:32,039
administrator can also become one of the

1003
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,990
best security professionals because

1004
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:35,609
again we've made these mistakes we know

1005
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,470
how the corners have been cut we know

1006
00:37:35,609 --> 00:37:40,049
where the skeletons are buried and so

1007
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:42,149
this kind of allows me to segue into how

1008
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:45,390
to get into info second how to get into

1009
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:47,880
security I get a question a week online

1010
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,710
from people and so one of the questions

1011
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,510
I really get a lot is is you know the

1012
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,940
concept of should you go for experience

1013
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:55,319
or should you go for a certification I

1014
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:57,450
kind of believe in both I mentioned that

1015
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:59,369
you know I'm an adamant fan of is

1016
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:01,379
c-squared a conte ia and all the

1017
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:03,869
different certifications there's a

1018
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:08,069
method to it anybody know who this guy

1019
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:11,039
is here Dave Ramsey I love Dave Dave got

1020
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:12,630
me out of 60 grand in debt it's all

1021
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,040
based on this concept of the debt

1022
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:16,020
snowball and

1023
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,250
taking the small bed debts and rolling

1024
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,600
them into the next one and once you get

1025
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,280
that paid off you go to the next one I

1026
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,890
highly encourage you if you're in any

1027
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,450
sort of fiscal debt take a look at

1028
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:26,670
Dave's course it's worth its weight in

1029
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:28,680
gold but if you apply it to the concepts

1030
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:31,290
of certifications in IT it just makes it

1031
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,029
even more sense so this is how I started

1032
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:35,190
I started with an A+ security we want

1033
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:37,590
the security plus and these build off of

1034
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:39,510
each other so again the harder that gets

1035
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:40,740
the you've already kind of maintained

1036
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:43,110
the baseline from the previous

1037
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:45,600
certification so I went from the SSCP to

1038
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:47,040
the CISSP and then there's all these

1039
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,620
different other ones that you can get

1040
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,360
now this is just a handful of governing

1041
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:54,150
bodies there's so many other different

1042
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,740
ones but you can do these are the ones

1043
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:58,320
that really go into the the crusader

1044
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:00,569
defensive style now if you want to go

1045
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,700
into more of a Red Team offensive

1046
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:04,410
certification track there's also a

1047
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,480
different certification track you can do

1048
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,950
as well these are just a handful but if

1049
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,780
you really want to hone your dark wizard

1050
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:12,299
skills definitely go down the route of a

1051
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:15,660
couple of these certifications OSC P and

1052
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:17,490
OSCE in particular really good ones but

1053
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:19,620
there's a problem with certifications

1054
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:22,049
they're only as good as the the paper

1055
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:24,060
that they're printed on so if you're

1056
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:25,650
going to get any of these certifications

1057
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:29,790
know what the hell you're talking about

1058
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:32,490
and demonstrate that okay so in lieu of

1059
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:35,400
doing a QA today I wanted to kind of

1060
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:37,410
make this an opportunity to kind of have

1061
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,850

1062

00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:48,299

name s does on a Linux system anybody it

1106
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:50,529
simply just checks the machine name

1107
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:53,230
properties of the remote system right

1108
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:55,750

do day to day all the time right anybody

1110
00:43:55,750 --> 00:44:00,579

1111
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:03,520
Solaris system now rename the host yeah

1112
00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:06,580
I can do with some damage

1113
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,890
I mean moving forward how many of you

1114
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,420
all have done this alright so show

1115
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:14,200
everybody's done then these are mistakes

1116
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:16,330
we all make right very quick easy fix to

1117
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,950
this simply and I've started doing this

1118
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:19,840
to my junior admins I put this in their

1119
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:21,730
profile and it has fixed so many

1120
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,010
unnecessary deletions in your

1121
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:25,570
organization so again just making simple

1122
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:26,860
fixes to correct that I saw somebody

1123
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:28,000
raise their hand earlier in the back did

1124
00:44:26,860 --> 00:45:00,610
you all have one more story you wanted

1125
00:44:28,000 --> 00:45:02,700
to say no yes Wow

1126
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:06,369
be careful of the commands you run very

1127
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:08,020
scary scary story there I got a couple

1128
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:10,800
other ones this one was given to one of

1129
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:13,540
my buddies and a DHA they used to run a

1130
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,920
they did remote support for restaurants

1131
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:17,320
and they had their credit card

1132
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,960
processing available via dial-up modem

1133
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,910
and so this ingenious young professional

1134
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,160
decided again this is a long time ago

1135
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:26,049
maintain a password list and decided to

1136
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,819
put it up on Geocities because nobody

1137
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:31,060
would ever go to this unlisted website

1138
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:33,620
right well funny enough there's this

1139
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:36,500
thing called wayback machine

1140
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:39,290
that password list which has never

1141
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,910
changed still works I swear to God so I

1142
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:44,360
mean this is some scary stuff we're

1143
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:46,279
talking about another really really good

1144
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,570
story came to me from my friends at

1145
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,800
fuzzy snuggly duck if you're not

1146
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:52,190
familiar with them look them up they're

1147
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:55,490
awesome incident folks this is a really

1148
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:57,980
good story about how to properly handle

1149
00:45:55,490 --> 00:46:00,709
an incident in this circumstance we have

1150
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:02,510
a database table that was compromised by

1151
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:04,370
an attacker attacker got into the

1152
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:07,460
network who was able to take X fill this

1153
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:08,690
data but not just X fill the data the

1154
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:10,940
attacker decided to be smart and

1155
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:12,830
basically planted their own canary back

1156
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:16,070
in and replaced one of the records in

1157
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:17,960
the database table so eventually the

1158
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:21,080
attackers were found in both sexes finds

1159
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,250
the the event and alerts the end users

1160
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,080
hey urines

1161
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:26,330
your data was compromised and we are

1162
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:28,580
we're on top of it right so the problem

1163
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:30,290
is that also ended up notifying the

1164
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:32,990
attacker because he caught her up did

1165
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:35,420
the data oh it gets better than that so

1166
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:36,850
again so InfoSec has now sent an email

1167
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:40,100
and they're you know company letterhead

1168
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:41,540
proper formatting you know telling them

1169
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:43,490
that hey you been breached so what's an

1170
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:45,410
attacker gonna do use that same

1171
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:47,029
letterhead just spam the hell out of

1172
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:49,940
just the same people that he just pwned

1173
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:52,250
so what the attacker ended up doing was

1174
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:54,410
said hey yeah you're right we have been

1175
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:56,420
compromised in order for payroll to be

1176
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:59,210
successfully done you're going to need

1177
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:01,970
to log into your this phishing site and

1178
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:04,700
give us your admin passwords so not only

1179
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:07,580
did they steal the data they also fished

1180
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:09,350
the attacker afterwards so all right so

1181
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:11,600
I've got a couple of things before I

1182
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:13,819
conclude and so again to make sure that

1183
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,950
you actually respond to me I'm going to

1184
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:18,230
bribe you none of this like small stuff

1185
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:19,549
I got a real full-size candy here so I

1186
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:20,630
told you there was going to be a quiz

1187
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:24,110
later all right

1188
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:26,090
SLA all right I can't hear y'all so I'm

1189
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:27,830
just gonna throw stuff okay by the way

1190
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:29,510
I'm so thankful there's no projectors

1191
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:31,460
like up here because if you've never

1192
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:33,820
seen a guy had a 4k projector with the

1193
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:36,440
like a Hershey bar it's not pretty so

1194
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:39,820
personal experience confession there so

1195
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,820
here we go all right

1196
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:45,860
service-level germane FCR yes good job

1197
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:57,690
CIA all right

1198
00:47:54,330 --> 00:48:06,210
AAA all right let's see if I'm get a

1199
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:09,530
spiral on this one I just wanted to put

1200
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:11,790
this in there so all right so again

1201
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:13,530
wrapping up guys just a couple of things

1202
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:15,630
too before I finish you know prioritize

1203
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:17,490
your security over operations that's

1204
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:20,550
it's an important thing don't cut

1205
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:22,950
corners it's kind of important the fact

1206
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:24,720
is is that the systems administrators

1207
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:26,640
these are the people that we're trusting

1208
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,600
to install these solutions they're

1209
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,890
probably the people that are

1210
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,730
circumventing them so let's watch our

1211
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:31,859
Watchers right

1212
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:33,330
be aware that you know just because the

1213
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:35,400
application may be secure

1214
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:38,009
maybe the installation itself isn't so

1215
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,170
be aware that misconfigurations are you

1216
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:42,960
know in jeopardy as well and the fact of

1217
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:44,670
the matter is is vs. admins we're humans

1218
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,830
too we're lazy we make mistakes

1219
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:48,750
there's errors that happen risk is

1220
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:50,670
everywhere learn from the mistakes that

1221
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:53,520
you've learned from today from myself

1222
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:55,320
the people here as well and the people

1223
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,150
that shared with online the confessions

1224
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:59,910
so again hopefully you won't make the

1225
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:02,370
same mistakes this kind of leads to me

1226
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:04,109
back to the three envelopes story that I

1227
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:06,210
told you at the very beginning when I

1228
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:09,990
first started at my very first sysadmin

1229
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:11,640
job I got three envelopes in my my desk

1230
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:13,229
drawer from the previous systems

1231
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,810
administrator and said hey this is what

1232
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:17,730
you need if something really goes awry

1233
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:19,110
and you just don't know what to do open

1234
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:21,240
one of these envelopes and it will

1235
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:23,250
really help you out so the first one

1236
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:25,830
when the production system went down I

1237
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:27,840
didn't know what to do I was about to

1238
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:29,730
lose my job so I decided to finally get

1239
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:32,670
that envelope I open it up and blame the

1240
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:34,500
previous assignment cycle that's all

1241
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:36,930
Sean's fault you know what it actually

1242
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:39,150
worked it actually kept me back I got my

1243
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:41,040
job at all good so about nine months

1244
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:43,380
later same thing happens again

1245
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,840
production goes down again things are

1246
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:47,800
going crazy I have to go back to the

1247
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:50,230
drawer I pull out the envelope I open it

1248
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:54,190
says blame the vendor so that's what I

1249
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:56,050
did work like a charm about six months

1250
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:58,720
later the same thing happened again so

1251
00:49:56,050 --> 00:50:00,940
again going back to my trusty envelope I

1252
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:06,160
open it up it says prepare three

1253
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:08,680
envelopes yes so that concludes my talk

1254
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,799
thank you so much everyone I appreciate

1255
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,799
it
