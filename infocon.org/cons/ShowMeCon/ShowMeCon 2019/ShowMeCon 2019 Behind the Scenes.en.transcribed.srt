1
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:16,539
carnival Kondos week

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,090
show me con 2019 in st. Louis Missouri

3
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:23,919
technically st. Charles I think I'll be

4
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:27,910
there in about three hours I gotta show

5
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:32,230
me con cookie bein is running around

6
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:35,290
here someplace but we have video fully

7
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:36,730
set up in room one here and not quite

8
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,829
set up in room tube we don't really have

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,080
that subtil break tomorrow

10
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:43,480
it's where we split the room in two and

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,580
then the imagination room is way that

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,599
direction which we will get fully set up

13
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:51,310
later on here we had the third room

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,050
known as imagination we're still working

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,050
on getting everything completely set up

16
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,600
here's some video of the Ameristar from

17
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,220
above it's one of those legal things

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,540
where they can do it above water because

19
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,759
technically it's a boat I don't know the

20
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,860
whole deal with that with casinos and

21
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:10,509
you can see the waters way up not as

22
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,609
high as the first year I was here but

23
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:14,170
still pretty cool look at unfortunately

24
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:16,630
need up our normal parking garage that

25
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,149
we use for offloading a ramp apparently

26
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,520
uh broke there and had some flooding

27
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:22,659
issues so a little complication but

28
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,990
things are set up and ready to go for

29
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:24,990
them all

30
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:37,759
a little bit more of the exterior you

31
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,560
can see we're a little bit flooded right

32
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,200
now but as someone mentioned on my

33
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,690
Twitter feed some states had this law by

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:50,530
having casinos you have to have them on

35
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:50,530
the river and well on the river

36
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,920
[Music]

37
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:09,539
normally back in the day what we would

38
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:12,790
do is poke up here on the third floor on

39
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,929
this side of the parking structure and B

40
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,420
of the wheel things in from Dining

41
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,220
Services unfortunately we couldn't do

42
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,089
that this year because apparently some

43
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:29,620
part of the garage got damaged all set

44
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:31,540
up a registration tomorrow go figure

45
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,280
2nd 7th year I've been here and I've

46
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,500
never actually really looked around the

47
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,210
building so I figured I'd go up on the

48
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,160
roof and tip around no I didn't have a

49
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:45,100
bypass anything get up here

50
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:47,140
but uh my good view in hindsight I kind

51
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:53,320
of wish I'd brought my hoodie it's kind

52
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:54,790
of cold up here I have to come back up

53
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,470
here in the morning sometime because I'm

54
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,489
betting the Sun rise over the Missouri

55
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,490
River it's going to be beautiful

56
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,010
we seem to have a feet in here that's

57
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,060
something like a film you're against

58
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,570
it's a cool-looking piece of

59
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,720
architecture I suppose

60
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,720
[Music]

61
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:29,200
up here at about sunrise we'll pretty

62
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:30,550
view in theory according to Google I

63
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,810
have about three minutes until the

64
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:37,900
actual sunrise but some nice views I'm

65
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:42,069
up here I think I'll hang out in the

66
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:45,209
courtyard later on you can see some of

67
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:45,208
the flooding that's been happening

68
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:14,820
I never knowed this before but appears

69
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,149
to be in inside an outside section of

70
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,149
the pool

71
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,449
roaming around the parking garage it's

72
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:28,759
closed

73
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:32,990
vaping a little bit found this floor

74
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:37,330
thank a bird expeller Pro assume the

75
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,330
uses the keeper birds out of the garage

76
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,580
and then guess I could probably see why

77
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,320
I focuses Rene Chronister she's one of

78
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,070
the people behind us show me Khan main

79
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,170
organizer

80
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,460
how are things going which show me kind

81
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,200
about and how many people we have an

82
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:56,780
attendance well things are going great

83
00:04:51,200 --> 00:05:14,240
we have show a constant information

84
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:15,859
security and so what we do is we have

85
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,330
practical application camera so anybody

86
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,850
that comes here can actually go back to

87
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,550
their office and show their boss the ROI

88
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:29,810
and apply what they've learned here to

89
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:32,260
their Figgy much lunch time zip bars on

90
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,260
the other side

91
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,400
hey David what's going on hey um since

92
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,500
our lockpick village this is basically

93
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,109
where we teach the inherent security

94
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,669
flaws and vulnerabilities of hardware

95
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,590
that is available commonly in the

96
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:48,900
consumer market in the United States the

97
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:51,380
main driving force behind this is to a

98
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,388
lot of people to know just how

99
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:57,210
vulnerable and heat our hardware is that

100
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:58,680
we use to secure our our personal

101
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,810
belongings in our homes

102
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,669
much like Locke did before the

103
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,250
government's back in the 90s in regards

104
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:06,810
to software vulnerabilities that push it

105
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,280
eventually to pets Tuesday impact

106
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,320
management these type of things we're

107
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,750
trying to inform society about the need

108
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,000
for similar types of investment research

109
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,889
redevelopment in products and harder

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,979
than that we used participants appearing

111
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:24,449
so we're hoping to teach educate inspire

112
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:27,060
and provide a better realm of security

113
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:29,250
for the hardware designation to secure

114
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,470
our personal belongings our homes our

115
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,710
families Thank You mr. David you're

116
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,710

120
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,140
information security conference that has

121
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,970
been put on in st. Charles Missouri for

122
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,400
the past seven years

123
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:55,210
it was started by a parameter security

124
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,640
my company it was named by yours truly

125
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,039
Adrian Crenshaw I mean technically maybe

126
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,550
it was a InfoSec bubble who named it I

127
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:06,550
said the last name okay and some whiskey

128
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,590
but either yes it worked out great

129
