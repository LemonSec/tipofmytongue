1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,929
and I was in who's that I would one day

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,490
come out here and do a presentation and

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,910
then I said wait a minute

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,469
we only got like 50 minutes to do this

5
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,900
and we're talking about the art of cyber

6
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:17,340
war let me come down here I don't like

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:20,189
sitting up and there's a lot to cover

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,140
and when I say a lot to cover this is

9
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,630
not gonna make you an expert this is not

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,359
going to make you the catch me I'll in

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:31,710
your organization but what I did was I

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:35,100
took the ten tenets of the order of

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,290
cyber war and I actually formed it into

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,680
a nice little presentation that I could

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,379
share with each and every one of you so

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:47,489
having said that we're gonna cover a lot

17
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,989
of ground in 15 minutes and I apologize

18
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,910
if it goes a little fast they say when

19
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:52,828
you start to breathe sometimes it goes a

20
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,648
little bit faster than you used to and

21
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,289
if I do go a little bit fast or you miss

22
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,300
something I can repeat it I can bring it

23
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,250
back out but I assure you there's a lot

24
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,128
of going on here I am NOT going to be

25
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,990
speaking or reading the slides one for

26
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,450
one one for one one for one the first

27
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,640
few slides I will because I want to do

28
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,049
the perfect setup the perfect putt

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,090
because I want to get us on the right

30
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,530
focus the right frame of mind and that's

31
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,530
what the first few slides are for

32
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:26,020
come on technology whoo wasn't supposed

33
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:31,419
to do that

34
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:34,039
there we go all right yeah

35
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:37,520
these quotes frame what I'm gonna talk

36
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:38,649
about today in some form or fashion some

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,119
more than others

38
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:44,479
essentially no battle plans Evert

39
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:48,709
survives contact with the enemy if you

40
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:50,810
want peace prepare for war the enemy of

41
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:52,520
my enemy is my friend and that would

42
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,970
come very prevalent a few things I'm

43
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,380
going to show you war is our profession

44
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:00,759
peace is our product for those who used

45
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:04,369
to work for sac moment of silence

46
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:06,379
you cannot simultaneously prevent and

47
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:09,799
prepare for war Albert Einstein said

48
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:11,810
that very good point I love this one

49
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:13,849
here it used to be it's currently said

50
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,129
the best defense is a good offense I'm

51
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:19,819
here to tell you with cyber it's the

52
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:23,569
other way around the best offense is a

53
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:24,530
good defense because no attack exist in

54
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:26,358
a vacuum

55
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,880
anything that you actually put towards

56
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:30,560
an enemy that enemy can use against you

57
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,480
there are a lot of variations on that

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,250
probably the most impressive one is

59
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,940
Stuxnet if you're familiar with that one

60
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,519
in the wild now that code exists that

61
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,720
allows people to use the same thing

62
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,900
against every other perpetrator or

63
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:48,349
threat actor who's out there cyberspace

64
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,120
is a war fighting domain general Keith

65
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:52,940
Alexander retired former director of the

66
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,730
NSA and US Cyber Command for its first

67
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:59,150
commander we won't on cyber until we own

68
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,760
cyber that's General John Raymond he is

69
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,919
the commander of Air Force Space Command

70
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:07,099
at one time they had the mission for

71
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:10,280
cyber it's now in transition to ACC and

72
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:12,349
of course investment in resource our

73
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,660
people for success that is the current

74
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:16,069
commander of the Air Force's Network

75
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,280
integration Center at Scott Air Force

76
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:22,339
Base who is now retiring he's moving on

77
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,650
to some greener fields but what he said

78
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,489
there's gonna be very important to what

79
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:31,069
the top main topic is brigadier general

80
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:33,470
Billy Mitchell and a periodical wing

81
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:36,709
defense made this statement of

82
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,330
about air power he said those interested

83
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,640
in the future in the country not only

84
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:42,620
from national defense standpoint but

85
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,269
from a civil commercial NECA Nam when as

86
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,970
well should study this matter carefully

87
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:48,860
because air power has not only come a

88
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,350
stay but is and will be a dominating

89
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,830
factor in the world's development guess

90
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:55,130
what

91
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:57,620
you can replace air power with cyber and

92
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:02,480
you are seriously talking about the

93
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:04,850
exact same thing no misses no missing a

94
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,649
beat no stuttering that's exactly what

95
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,870
we're talking about it is here to say a

96
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,040
much like air power industry best

97
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,470
practice of continue to evolve

98
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,140
cyberspace technology technologies to

99
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,950
enhance war fighting in every way

100
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,169
possible

101
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,269
in capabilities every year since we've

102
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,410
actually began talking about cyber and

103
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,780
we've been talking about cyber for a

104
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:27,890
long time

105
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:29,270
so what cyber logic will argue about it

106
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,610
you know what cyber I don't know what

107
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,250
cyber is cyber is this cyber is dead I'm

108
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:37,370
here to tell you we've been doing cyber

109
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,140
before we called it cyber this is my

110
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,820
definition first and foremost the term

111
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,010
cyber is often used with the suffix

112
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,710
space to denote the realm of its

113
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,000
capability and ciphers utilization of

114
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,039
mechanical electronic systems device

115
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,080
process displaced or encrypt transmit

116
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,020
receive information and/or data from

117
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,150
one-to-many one-to-one many of the many

118
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,940
many to one depending on how it's being

119
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,349
utilized and over short long range

120
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,550
geographical locations so what are we

121
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,840
talking about how about wire every time

122
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,030
on microwave come on if radiofrequency

123
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:10,820
like fiber optics just to name a few all

124
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:14,419
of that is cyber not just computers not

125
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,770
just networks all of that is cyber once

126
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:17,630
we start looking at it and that

127
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:20,060
framework and that focus we begin to

128
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,919
realize that not only have we had it for

129
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,710
a while but these are the same things

130
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,560
that we are combating and using as both

131
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,239
offensive and defensive measures it

132
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,030
since the beginning of war fighting

133
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:36,770
doctrine and of course cyberspace is the

134
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:38,390
domain of all things cyber so what are

135
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,710
we going to be talking about roughly and

136
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:44,930
a very quick fast pace and all of these

137
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,650
things you've heard some you're like oh

138
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,330
great

139
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,090
cyberspace cyrus

140
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:52,430
cyber exploitation cyber to raise a

141
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:55,008
buret capability cyberattacks every

142
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:58,129
defense cyber resilience able to keep

143
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:59,509
going and processing cyber dependencies

144
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:00,020
things that we need to keep everything

145
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:02,360
going

146
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,729
cyberspace superiority if you have any

147
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,719
familiarity with the Air Force or flight

148
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:07,669
or anything like that we talked about

149
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:09,280
air superiority as we talked about

150
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:11,090
earlier with general Billy Mitchell

151
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,900
cyberspace superiority

152
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:16,810
cyber dominates cyber weapons systems

153
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:20,179
cyber operations which is made up of

154
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:22,580
defensive cyber operations and offensive

155
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:25,159
cyber operations of course cyber warfare

156
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:27,409
which is the big piece there sybaritic

157
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:29,719
effects and we're talking about second

158
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:32,210
and third order effects things we do

159
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:34,789
things the adversary does things that

160
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:38,650
cause this this this to happen to reach

161
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:41,539
your goal objective cyber workforce

162
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,388
cybercrime and of course cyber

163
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:46,430
operations command and control

164
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:49,460
everything needs to focus on what we're

165
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,940
actually going to do to get the job done

166
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:55,909
who's in charge who's making it happen

167
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:58,669
so the order cyber war is an extension a

168
00:06:55,909 --> 00:07:01,009
continuation of the art of war by Sun

169
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:02,120
Tzu Lobby will say well Neutron I

170
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:03,500
replaced this note it's not a

171
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,960
replacement it's an extension it's a

172
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,969
continuation sons who already laid the

173
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,258
groundwork for this and when he laid the

174
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,759
groundwork those things are still

175
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:14,690
applicable today war the vital

176
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,190
importance to the state when I say state

177
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:21,169
I mean a nation state but I'm here to

178
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:22,969
tell you it is a mission impossible but

179
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:28,870
like the venerable movie and television

180
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:31,190
series we are still going to do it why

181
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,529
every other nation state in the world is

182
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,770
doing it is it going to be difficult

183
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:38,330
absolutely I'm gonna tell you why today

184
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,770
when we talk about cyber we talked about

185
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,750
networks we talked about all of these

186
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,310
things are directly a part of it people

187
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:46,089
keep talking about oh we don't have

188
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:48,259
enough people we don't have enough money

189
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:50,810
we need to figure out how we can do more

190
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,190
with less a joke we used to tell when I

191
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,080
was in the military was we've done so

192
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,219
much with so little for so long we now

193
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,949
believe we can do everything with

194
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:58,909
nothing and I'm here to tell you that's

195
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:02,090
not a good

196
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:04,360
way to look at these this will require

197
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,650
more money

198
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,120
stop cutting your budget you're gonna

199
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:12,409
need it it's going to require more

200
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:16,240
people and not just more people we need

201
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:19,580
to start building or cyber workforce

202
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,560
resources that's a given and not just

203
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,609
resources from the folks working in

204
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,070
particular jobs I'm talking about

205
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,170
resources of our computer companies our

206
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,310
PC makers our network manager we talked

207
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,890
about Cisco we're talking about

208
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:35,090
everybody that has every piece of every

209
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:36,890
device in the IOT world that we use to

210
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:39,380
include the government to military and

211
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:41,630
everyone else everyone is a part of this

212
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,720
and I'm gonna tell you later why when we

213
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,130
discuss cyber terrain standards best

214
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,740
practices in governance one thing I've

215
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:52,220
always heard was we need to do it like

216
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,540
I'll talk about the DoD saying this we

217
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,100
need to do it like the commercial world

218
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,459
is doing it we need to do it because

219
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:01,070
they don't have all the problems we have

220
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:03,920
well stand there best practices we

221
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:07,220
should be doing it like they're doing it

222
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,469
the problem is we keep trying to do more

223
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:12,470
with less we keep trying to hand over

224
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:17,240
everything we have to the commercial

225
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:19,460
world now I'm not saying don't do that

226
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,570
but I will say this and you hear me say

227
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:24,260
this later on throughout this entire

228
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:29,390
brief there is no one silver bullet to

229
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:31,250
get after this not one there are a lot

230
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:34,130
of silver bullets that make up a whole

231
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,350
but there is not one do we need

232
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,630
commercial services absolutely should we

233
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:41,840
have centralized management yes do we

234
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,560
need decentralized management yes over

235
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,180
and over again

236
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,859
should we put all the stuff in the cloud

237
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,239
yeah we should put some in there should

238
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,610
we not put certain things in the cloud

239
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,610
absolutely there's no one silver bullet

240
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:54,880
but in the defense defense and def

241
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:58,930
strategy that's what we're talking about

242
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:01,010
now I said this is a mission impossible

243
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,189
many will immediately know this and

244
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:06,200
realize what I'm talking about is true

245
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:08,150
one of the big reasons is these folks

246
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,870
need to work together government

247
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,529
corporate individuals insiders allies

248
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,470
everyone that has a pee

249
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:17,870
so whatever we're working on to make the

250
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,899
country secure people don't trust the

251
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,399
government people don't trust the fact

252
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:24,860
that the information they get they're

253
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,930
going to keep private people don't trust

254
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,759
corporate America they think they're

255
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:31,099
pretty much using our data and of course

256
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:32,889
we've been watching the news people

257
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:37,300
believe we have a reason to believe that

258
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:39,439
individuals got to work on this insiders

259
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,059
you worried about the outside threat the

260
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,498
insider threat is even is even bigger

261
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:44,120
because they know your network they know

262
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:45,829
your naming conventions they know how

263
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,360
everything's set up and of course

264
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:49,128
whatever allies you got if you've been

265
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,660
watching the news the whole ally thing

266
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:53,149
kind of kicks around over and over again

267
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,069
because we don't want to give someone

268
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:58,069
technology whose buddies were folks

269
00:10:55,069 --> 00:11:00,290
we're not buddies with but that's common

270
00:10:58,069 --> 00:11:02,559
sense but these are the things that make

271
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,399
this a mission impossible

272
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,829
corporate America doesn't want to share

273
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,269
its data or technology or suite secure

274
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:10,638
things because it thinks that this other

275
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:12,559
company is going to take it and make

276
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,600
more money off of it or they think the

277
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,160
government is going to take it and abuse

278
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,750
it to use it you have a lot of these

279
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,430
things that are kicking around people's

280
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,439
head but each and every one of those

281
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,540
partners have to work together because

282
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:27,050
in countries who are beating us out left

283
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:29,649
and right they don't have a problem that

284
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:33,920
we have they don't care about privacy

285
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:35,540
they don't care how you feel they lock

286
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,099
down their networks they laugh you look

287
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,819
at China ties like yeah we don't care oh

288
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:44,000
no you can't go to that site and for

289
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:47,839
that I'm not saying we're going to lose

290
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,610
some privacy but it's a mission

291
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,589
impossible we have to find some way to

292
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,939
trust but the bottom line is the world

293
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:56,569
is already involved in a cyber war

294
00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:58,219
already in fact it has been for a number

295
00:11:56,569 --> 00:12:02,059
of years and I tell you this truly if

296
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,459
you physically break into a military

297
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:06,170
installation you drive some trucks up

298
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:07,518
you bust down the gate you go up to the

299
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,649
front door of a building you're breaking

300
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,269
your steel drives you pop them out there

301
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:15,110
you run you shootout hop in your truck

302
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:19,329
and you drive away are you at war the

303
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:23,600
answer is yes but if you do it via cyber

304
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:25,339
and we're not really sure that we should

305
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,080
go ahead and neck but I tell you truly

306
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:28,390
not

307
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,670
two weeks ago some folks were you who

308
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:32,860
were hacking into Israel and Israel

309
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:36,069
didn't take a soft approach digital took

310
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:39,130
down the whole building now is it a

311
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:42,490
third order of effect yes it is did they

312
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:44,110
stop the attack oh yes they did but once

313
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,210
again it all depends on what data you

314
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,410
have how you got it and who actually did

315
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,940
it and those are some of the changes

316
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,189
we're going to need to do but there must

317
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,710
be tenants to successfully get through

318
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:56,650
this these are the tenants of cyber war

319
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:58,660
reduce the threat surface cyber command

320
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,790
and control cyber terrain defensive

321
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:03,550
cyber operations offensive cyber

322
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:06,730
operations threat actors cyber partners

323
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:09,579
law of cyber conflict emerging

324
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:13,480
technologies and cyber workforce and

325
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:15,940
every last one of these is important to

326
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:20,410
getting after developing good strong

327
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:21,790
tactics techniques and procedures so

328
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,959
reduce the threat surface a lot of

329
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,280
people are going to look at me and gonna

330
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,990
say you're crazy this is never going to

331
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,160
happen we're not going to do it this is

332
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,480
the way the government this is a way to

333
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,120
limit rate this way the folks look at

334
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,540
it's politics politics politics I agree

335
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,700
it's a mission impossible first one is

336
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,589
like I said earlier the best defense is

337
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,140
a good offense well in cyber the best

338
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,910
defense is a good offense because

339
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,819
nothing exists in a vacuum

340
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:49,089
any attack in cyber you use against an

341
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:54,300
enemy they can use that same thing

342
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:57,370
against you and then need much to do it

343
00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:02,650
reduce eliminate enter access bond lock

344
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:05,200
it not people that go the lock it who's

345
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,760
familiar with phishing everybody this

346
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,680
everybody knows what that is if who

347
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,470
spray Europe wailing everyone should be

348
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:14,800
familiar with it these are some of the

349
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:16,300
key ways they get into our network they

350
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,709
see in it and are getting better at in

351
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,260
the old days there's need some fishing

352
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:23,080
stuff and things like that it's

353
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,420
misspelled words did the whole English

354
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:29,680
language is jar bored and broken today

355
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:31,540
it looks amazing it's like they hired

356
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,250
some folks to go out there and go make

357
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,050
this look right yeah yeah that's not

358
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,940
grammatically correct fix this and looks

359
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,890
good there taking whole pages that their

360
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:44,440
sinning folks that's looking like

361
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:45,850
you got something from DHL or or came in

362
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,400
with a big who's big brown what is that

363
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,960
guy you did here you though it looks

364
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,090
like that I get these things all the

365
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,470
time in my mail and I know it an orderly

366
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,510
thing or they tell you you got something

367
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:58,090
coming in they're good at it and they're

368
00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:00,189
exceptionally good at it and when you

369
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:03,280
look at folks who are x4 trading data

370
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:05,920
from our networks it's because we're

371
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,089
attached to the Internet now here's a

372
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,930
question once again remember there's no

373
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:14,320
silver bullets what that means is this

374
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:16,900
your war fighting machine she had no

375
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,090
access to the Internet things you to do

376
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,860
with contracts or things like that yeah

377
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,810
you're gonna talk to your customers by

378
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,680
the way this is just as good for the

379
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:29,170
military as it is for corporate America

380
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,839
only difference is corporate America has

381
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:34,360
the capability to do this better because

382
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,520
the military's huge it's big it's gonna

383
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,220
take time like everyone down people are

384
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:42,340
going to scream oh we need this that

385
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,560
everyone needs it take it off the

386
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,120
internet it should have no access

387
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,300
all right here's next we've got to get

388
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,740
do these two encryption now I came

389
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,780
across this one some years ago when I

390
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,520
used to work for a government agency

391
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,720
that will not say because their crew

392
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,790
agency and I don't want to like have

393
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,030
anyone rushing to get a job there

394
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,469
three types of encryption in transit

395
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,810
everyone's familiar with that point A to

396
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:07,690
point B at rest and sitting up in a

397
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:09,609
storage device this last one here it's

398
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:12,700
called user encryption this is what it

399
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:15,880
does now some of the stuff may or may

400
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:18,790
not exist may or may not exist but it

401
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:24,000
should exist which is the whole point of

402
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:26,890
this user encryption is the data on your

403
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,860
workstations your laptops wherever they

404
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:34,030
are until you need it it's encrypted it

405
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,460
sits out there in an encrypted

406
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,689
environment we once had a laptop and

407
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,610
they said oh yeah you're gonna punch in

408
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,050
this pan and when you boot it up and

409
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:45,730
then it under Crips and you run it and I

410
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:49,689
said okay if I take my my token out and

411
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:50,100
the screen locks is it encrypted no it's

412
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,350
not

413
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,370
and how is the enemy getting that data

414
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,810
they're coming through the network

415
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,230
lateral movement they're going to the

416
00:16:54,810 --> 00:17:01,319
machines that are pulling the data off

417
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:03,149
if you're not using the data it needs to

418
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,740
be encrypted and I know how many times

419
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:06,449
if you look at that this is reducing the

420
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,799
threat surface now this is the focus I

421
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:09,449
don't know how many times I've hear all

422
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:12,030
these companies targeted and all these

423
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:15,959
other places if they would just encrypt

424
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:18,418
the data it would reduce that threat

425
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:21,000
notice I didn't say eliminate reduce

426
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:24,990
that threat of course deny by default

427
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,040
allowed by exception diskless systems

428
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,549
we've been talking about it for years

429
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,020
you don't need it white listing in black

430
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,370
listing and the reason why both of those

431
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,410
are there even though I'm talking about

432
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:38,280
a system doesn't have access to the

433
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:40,860
Internet you should have only allowance

434
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,168
to go to systems that you need to do

435
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:47,699
your job anyone that has a sip speed

436
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:49,950
this is one on one reduce access to what

437
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,020
you need to do your job black listing

438
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,190
block everything in those systems that

439
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,379
are connected to the internet that you

440
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,900
do customer service with they should be

441
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,549
locked down as well this is a lot of

442
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,340
work to get done which is why I say even

443
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:05,270
cars a lot of people a lot of access to

444
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:09,658
domain only or a lot only sites required

445
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:11,580
block non domains maybe not yours

446
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:13,710
people have asked me questions well what

447
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,750
if we need access to the news and things

448
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,940
like that because a lot of organizations

449
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:20,970
allow that a one-way cache this

450
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,100
technology existed back in the early 90s

451
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,630
what it basically was is you want to go

452
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,770
to a website you want to look up news or

453
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:29,400
something like that they had a new

454
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:31,889
server one server that would go out talk

455
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,080
to the new server bring that page up one

456
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:36,390
server that went through the Gateway and

457
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,850
then it mirrored that page and everyone

458
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:41,010
inside that network that Enclave will go

459
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:46,168
to that link it's sort of bogging down

460
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:48,090
the Gateway pretty simple use herbs out

461
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:49,049
of bear networks a lot of sisters run

462
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,970
through different problems they keep

463
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:52,860
talking about credentials you can't use

464
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,120
your credentials for your a user access

465
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,459
and you should do your network

466
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,239
administration out of man networks make

467
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,580
that happen

468
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,250
lease privilege is what we're talking

469
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,110
about we look at things who has access

470
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,790
to what a lot of this stuff you

471
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,350
heard before a lot of stuff you're

472
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,360
familiar with all stuff you're doing at

473
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,389
your locations but no one is doing all

474
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,919
of these or they're doing it partially

475
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:15,150
monitor track adjudicate all users

476
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,460
that's a given

477
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:20,190
segmentation segmentation segmentation

478
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,570
when I started doing this almost 30

479
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,400
years actually thirty years ago when I

480
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:26,220
started doing their two networks my left

481
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,110
radios and mainframes if you were

482
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,470
finance you were separate if you were HR

483
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:32,219
you were separate if you were supply and

484
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,920
all these other things you had a

485
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,030
separate piece where you sat in and no

486
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,460
one else who did not work in that area

487
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:40,918
could access that but we all know this

488
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,929
if you work in the industry you've seen

489
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:44,309
it you know what's true but in a lot of

490
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:46,410
places we don't do that anymore

491
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:48,290
we just put it all together one big

492
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,280
hodgepodge and people got access

493
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:52,080
reducing the threat surface not only the

494
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,710
first tenth of the auto cyborg it is a

495
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,649
key function of defensive cyber

496
00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:00,570
operations which by the way there's a

497
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,059
whole nother section but here's some of

498
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:05,220
your benefits you eliminate reduce

499
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:06,720
unauthorized access internally and

500
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,059
externally networks and when I ask

501
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,910
something else to that once you start

502
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:14,850
doing these things your biggest threat

503
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:17,190
is going to be your insider so there are

504
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,959
you companies out there you might start

505
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:24,650
talking your folks about building better

506
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:28,020
tools to get after the insider threat

507
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:29,370
it eliminates external malware threats

508
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,350
once again there's you're inside a

509
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,790
thread networking you're tracking

510
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,879
monitor you're tracking everyone on the

511
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:38,340
inside we already do that now but we

512
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,280
don't do it as well as we do tracking

513
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:43,290
people coming in from the outside

514
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:45,240
proactive countermeasures Network

515
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,950
detection is cyber tools and all these

516
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,510
things some friends out there in the

517
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,790
back of work net defense they can tell

518
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:53,520
you all about it and a day you're

519
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:55,980
looking at millions of tax on your

520
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,470
network and you got tools you got to

521
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,910
watch it once again if you reduce the

522
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,580
net surface you increase your bandwidth

523
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:04,620
to do other things

524
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:06,780
Louis urgency to push patches guess what

525
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,370
you're not on the Internet you don't

526
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:12,178
have that big threat trying to get at

527
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:14,820
you so you still got a patch but guess

528
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:16,679
what the urgencies a little bit lower

529
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,050
now you don't have to kill yourself to

530
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,830
make it happen but you're still gonna do

531
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:24,270
it and I recommend in that environment

532
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:26,428
have good processes if you have

533
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:29,250
exceptional processes you can get after

534
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:32,160
and you're good reduce the threat

535
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,780
surface high focus on internal insider

536
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,840
threats as I mentioned we gives you time

537
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:40,200
to go on the offensive right now we do

538
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,790
more defensive stuff than we do

539
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,740
offensive because we have to get after

540
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:45,240
the bad guys we have to patch this we

541
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,190
have to bring it down and we're worried

542
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,100
about someone else exploiting it we saw

543
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:52,919
always joke about Patch Tuesday

544
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:55,139
exploit Wednesday from Microsoft this

545
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:57,809
gives you latitude to get after the

546
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,950
things you need to cyber command and

547
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:01,190
control I'm not going to go into detail

548
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:04,280
with this because I'm already at 20

549
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:06,600
who's getting out there

550
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,950
cyber is a force multiplier securing

551
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,409
enhancing the effectiveness of the

552
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:13,830
domains and their missions it's also war

553
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:15,690
fighting domain command and control it's

554
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:20,090
just like everything else we got we got

555
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:23,429
air we got C we got land it's the same

556
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:25,409
thing you need someone in charge you

557
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:28,710
need someone to say this is what we're

558
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:30,120
doing this is how we're doing it this is

559
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:33,240
how it connects we all know what's

560
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,309
important but everyone's like well we

561
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,559
don't know how cyber fits in it's the

562
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:41,010
same thing the only difference is this

563
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:45,780
in the old days it was kinetic war

564
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:47,760
moving tanks ships aircraft people

565
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:52,230
resources from one side of the world to

566
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:55,169
the next but guess what two or three

567
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:59,370
advanced persistent actors the great

568
00:22:55,169 --> 00:23:01,110
skill sets can do all of that from their

569
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:04,620
basement from we're placed right

570
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:08,449
anywhere in the world so command and

571
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:13,260
control you need to make sure when I say

572
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:13,860
what's the good offense a good a good

573
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:18,840
defense

574
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:22,229
so just what cyber terrain this is our

575
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,720
cyber terrain today defense industrial

576
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:26,550
base government facilities

577
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,850
communications financial medical first

578
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:29,409
responders

579
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:31,809
everything you can think of because

580
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:34,870
guess what if the enemy cannot fight you

581
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:36,639
on his own ground he can use cyber to

582
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:39,549
take down your financial network kicking

583
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,520
you cyber wanna crip hit over a hundred

584
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:46,360
and 71 countries in a very short window

585
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,370
of time 171 countries now let me tell

586
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,080
you something most people look at that

587
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,250
nigga blonde and groups you know to

588
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,960
encrypt the stuff they wanted money

589
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,370
didn't want it this guess what the most

590
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,950
important thing was not that they were

591
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:59,110
asking for money or Bitcoin or whatever

592
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:04,860
it hit a hundred and seventy one

593
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:09,340
countries and a small window a time

594
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:12,639
that's a pretty good impact so when I

595
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:14,980
say we have to get after these things

596
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,809
here reducing the threat surface not

597
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,690
just the military industrial base

598
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:21,940
chemicals dams nucleus the SCADA systems

599
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:24,640
water wastes emergency services

600
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:27,190
beautiful things were talking about the

601
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,710
price necessary pays for a capability a

602
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:32,169
to or a weapon can be slight minuscule

603
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:33,970
but the cost of the impact borne by the

604
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:36,130
victim to the attack can be very high

605
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:38,740
there are people now that are still

606
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:40,080
feeling that impact their people now

607
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,669
still trying to go she ate money

608
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,899
Baltimore it's still experiencing

609
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:45,909
problems we're not they're gonna pay off

610
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:49,150
these hackers who are using these tools

611
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:51,730
so when I tell you the cyber terrain is

612
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:56,070
no longer confined to a geographic

613
00:24:51,730 --> 00:25:00,100
location I'm not just making this up

614
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:04,168
everything is a target in your country

615
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:06,580
in their country they know it we know it

616
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:08,309
if I can't get you on the battlefield I

617
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,510
get you on the ground advanced aircraft

618
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:12,549
you got an aircraft that's great that's

619
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:14,350
amazing like our f-35 that people talk

620
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:16,179
about so much but it's the most advanced

621
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,500
aircraft of its time if I can't beat it

622
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:19,710
in the air I'm gonna attack it on the

623
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,710
ground

624
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,090
defensive cyber operations once again

625
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,850
big piece that is reduce the threat

626
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:32,060
surface we already do this to some

627
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:34,790
degree but we're doing it sloppy

628
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:38,450
accountability our hardware/software

629
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:39,680
typologies applications how many people

630
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,170
in your organization can tell you they

631
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,880
know what all those things are ID

632
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:46,220
connection points once again mission

633
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,540
impossible for companies it's a little

634
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,890
bit easier to do and I'll tell you why

635
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:52,250
because the company only has so many

636
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:55,970
points into their business country-wise

637
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:58,880
we have satellite we have phone we have

638
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:01,460
mobile we have wire we have all of these

639
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,990
things that we now got to contend with

640
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:07,040
how do we reduce that threat surface

641
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:08,690
because the enemy is gonna try to come

642
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,600
in and as we talked about in the old

643
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:15,380
days if vulnerabilities sure by one is a

644
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,320
vulnerability sure by all so mandatory

645
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,370
patching hardware we said that earlier

646
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,080
Australia has some great things to talk

647
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,979
about four things you can do to reduce

648
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:26,720
it incredibly internal whitelisting

649
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,980
operating system patching probably

650
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,480
having a whole bunch of things that they

651
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,380
actually have and you got to know what

652
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,300
it is and you gotta be able to

653
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:35,440
adjudicate it ports protocols and

654
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,790
services deployed monitors and sensors

655
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,200
evolution of network Ops teams in the

656
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,820
old days it was just a cyst that you did

657
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,320
everything and after the cyst we said oh

658
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,030
we need some security guys who did ia

659
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,310
waiting we don't know what happened on

660
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:48,110
this hard driver on this machine and so

661
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,580
that response teams became the thing and

662
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:52,280
then they said don't should we monitor

663
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:55,790
the traffic computer network defense and

664
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,350
today we have CPT's cyber protection

665
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,790
teams I'll call them

666
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,240
uber geeks because they can do some

667
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:03,920
amazing stuff and that mazing skill sets

668
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,680
countermeasures attack and sensing and

669
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,170
know your critical data define it know

670
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,600
what it is you can protect it if you

671
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:14,810
label and define the criticality of the

672
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:18,590
data who owns it and of course DC

673
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:20,570
offices operations cyber is our which is

674
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:22,010
a Intelligence Surveillance

675
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:24,080
reconnaissance countermeasures

676
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:26,570
monitoring health systems all of these

677
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,149
things play a big factor in what we do

678
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:33,169
that's defensive on a flip side is

679
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:36,280
offensive cyber operations these are the

680
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:38,510
folks who are getting after the bad guys

681
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,930
they talk about a lot of things talk

682
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:42,240
about hacking back and all

683
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:43,590
and I'm here to tell you those are not

684
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,330
good things unless you know what you're

685
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:48,590
doing you know exactly who the enemy is

686
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:52,020
what Israel did a couple of weeks ago

687
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:54,510
they're cyber capabilities is through

688
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:58,710
the roof and when I say through the roof

689
00:27:54,510 --> 00:28:01,560
they do a lot of this but then again so

690
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:04,560
this China so this North Korea so the

691
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:08,610
few other places that all depends on how

692
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,870
much you want to do it submission

693
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:11,129
impossible if you're worried about the

694
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:14,070
money if you're worried about the people

695
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:15,360
but how much do you want to do offensive

696
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,560
operations are against the average

697
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,939
serger thread actor if you talk to

698
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,700
anyone who works in the DoD they talk

699
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,740
about the DS vinai degree disrupt

700
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,600
destroy manipulate we're talking about

701
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,850
getting after the enemy chasing them

702
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,129
down making sure that he no longer can

703
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:31,199
do what he can do and they possess the

704
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:34,620
knowledge the skills and abilities of

705
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:38,100
VCO when I say DCO I mean offensive

706
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:43,919
cyber operations has CP T's in d co has

707
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:47,879
CPT's your OC o CP teas are Boober uber

708
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:50,670
geeks because their tools are made to

709
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,250
take down the bad guys anyway possible

710
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:55,290
and they need to be able to know the

711
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,730
terrain and do exactly what defensive

712
00:28:55,290 --> 00:29:00,230
measures are cuz ly these countries are

713
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:02,700
using the same defensive measures

714
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:05,160
Matthew adversary terrain I was just

715
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,740
talking about passive recon of adversary

716
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:11,430
cyber terrain active as a last resort

717
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,990
resume I see as a last resort one of the

718
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,340
threat actors talks about going after

719
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:16,800
folks and whenever they're found out

720
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:18,570
they get loud when I say loud they don't

721
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,770
care who hears them get as much data as

722
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,389
you can get out because they already

723
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:23,490
know where they're on to us and that's

724
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:24,900
pretty much what they do support the

725
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,640
mission command and mission sets

726
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,590
whatever they are countermeasures of

727
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,960
course the tax sensor warning all of

728
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:33,179
these things are repeats of a lot of

729
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,300
things you see there but of course in DC

730
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:39,090
oh you do not see target acquisition

731
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,960
that's a big piece just like in the

732
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:43,770
kinetic world

733
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,600
we got targets we get after threat

734
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:46,920
actors all right you're gonna love this

735
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,959
part here because I love it it's my

736
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:52,380
favorite third actors or who I call

737
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,220
advanced persistent adversaries damn

738
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,950
greedy

739
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:58,440
they got more money than we do they got

740
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:01,919
better bandwidth they got faster CPUs

741
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,880
they had no rules of engagement in other

742
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,970
words they can do whatever the hell they

743
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,549
want and they can have as many

744
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,740
identities as they want so these are

745
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:14,908
your world threat actors cyber mercenary

746
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:17,039
these are folks that hey hundred

747
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:19,500
thousand you take out you got next sir

748
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:22,260
Thanks checks in the mail cyber

749
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,549
vigilante those guys these are some

750
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:27,150
pissed-off people with advanced

751
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:27,510
persistent skillsets they're looking for

752
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:31,580
payback

753
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:33,110
and they're out there cyber terrace

754
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:35,309
nation-states

755
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:37,740
rogue states these are folks who say

756
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:39,149
they represent the nation-state but they

757
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:42,240
work outside of that environment

758
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:43,679
corporate hackers hackers in general

759
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,309
always gonna leave that one in there

760
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,320
hacktivists home users zombies if he's

761
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:51,178
why I say zombies a lot of your

762
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,340
computers are probably on command and

763
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:54,150
control network box being used as

764
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,789
something else

765
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:59,789
organized crime they're using advanced

766
00:30:56,789 --> 00:31:01,950
persistent skill sets criminal elements

767
00:30:59,789 --> 00:31:04,320
and the difference we nose to is these

768
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:05,309
guys are organized crimes these are Joe

769
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,110
Blow who knew a little bit about

770
00:31:05,309 --> 00:31:10,470
computers that are taking advantage of

771
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:12,719
it insider threats now all these folks

772
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:14,570
may work independently part of a

773
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,909
consortium a group of folks like

774
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:20,490
anonymous or they may be conscripted

775
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:22,230
third party hackers by a country who

776
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:24,990
knows that these folks believe in their

777
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:26,669
same cause or do we need members of

778
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:29,640
multiple groups they may be members of

779
00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:32,730
more than one of these the funny thing

780
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,470
is depending how you look at it there's

781
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:37,200
a slight dips between a white hat a gray

782
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:39,299
hat and a black hat it all depends on if

783
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,320
you have the same interests the enemy of

784
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:44,668
my enemy is my friend

785
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,428
cyber partners this what I was talking

786
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:50,039
about all of these entities have to work

787
00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:53,900
together they have to work together to

788
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:57,030
secure the nation-state

789
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,530
they gotta trust each other hacker

790
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:02,190
groups are a big part of that I'm gonna

791
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:05,129
tell you why when I was younger gamers

792
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,980
controlled the market of advancing

793
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:09,830
technology and computer

794
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:12,230
I had four Meg's of RAM these guys hit

795
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:13,879
32 and they were playing games they were

796
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,100
having a time in her life and I was

797
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,049
pissed with him cuz I couldn't afford 32

798
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:22,549
Meg's I had a wife kids I got to take

799
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:24,710
care of but those gamers made sure the

800
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:28,129
market grew they made memory cheaper

801
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:31,340
they made video faster they made you

802
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:33,590
would not have HD video or 4k today

803
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,209
without those guys and gals who are

804
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:37,250
actually involved in that but I

805
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:41,120
understood that they drew they pretty

806
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:42,289
much drove that market today you don't

807
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,260
drive it as much because the most of

808
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:49,039
them live on platforms like ps3 and all

809
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:50,179
those other things ps3 Xbox Nintendo who

810
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,950
drives the market today of this

811
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:56,320
technology cutting-edge or hackers

812
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:59,630
they're at the top of this list

813
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,870
hackers are rogue innovators this is

814
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:05,840
what they do or this is what we do first

815
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:08,418
we live between boundaries we look at

816
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,490
programming and we say all right this

817
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:12,950
program ok I got to do this I gotta

818
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,330
follow this rule oh no you can't do that

819
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,450
you got to use it this way

820
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:20,360
hackers think outside of the box that's

821
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:22,399
why we have so much amazing malware and

822
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,070
things out there they go from point A to

823
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,189
point C and it's like how'd you come up

824
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:29,330
with that because the rogue innovators

825
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,820
they're trying to figure out how they

826
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:33,889
can get the best out of what's what

827
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:36,049
already there and they're really good

828
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:39,260
hackers and I characterize them as 100

829
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:41,510
200 300 and 400 level hackers you're 400

830
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,520
level hacker takes nothing with him when

831
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:45,140
they go out to hack you know why because

832
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,879
they know your system they know your

833
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:49,520
applications they know your products

834
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,140
they know how to use what you have and

835
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,450
know what vulnerabilities exist in these

836
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:55,429
products that are out there to get

837
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:57,590
accurate so each of these folks here

838
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:59,240
gotta work together they gotta come up

839
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,658
with a way that they can trust one

840
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,419
another

841
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:04,100
to secure the network as I said earlier

842
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:06,350
a vulnerability shared by one is a

843
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:09,049
vulnerability share by all if your

844
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:10,190
satellite system is vulnerable your

845
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:12,980
hacker will come in through your

846
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:14,119
satellite system if it's your Pio TV no

847
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,070
telephone systems they'll come in

848
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:19,010
through that your cell phones and we're

849
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:20,250
talking about today the Internet of

850
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,150
Things

851
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:24,610
making everything touch everything

852
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:27,030
everything can access everything and why

853
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:29,530
did I say earlier about no silver bullet

854
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:32,230
everything should not be able to touch

855
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:33,580
everything there is no one silver bullet

856
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:35,050
there are some things you should say oh

857
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,900
no these things are not going on there

858
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:39,720
yes these things are but you got to make

859
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,920
that distinction once you start going

860
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:45,009
exclusively in those directions

861
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:47,730
you're losing positive control and these

862
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:54,700
guys being partners never happens

863
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:56,440
law of armed cyber conflict right now we

864
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:58,240
have problems with laws in every country

865
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,490
some countries have good cyber law some

866
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,770
country have halfway-decent cyber law

867
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:04,899
some have none if you're hacking from a

868
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,040
country that has no laws they can almost

869
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,260
pretty much get away with anything

870
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:11,080
unless they're extradited to a country

871
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:15,130
that wants them we have a guy who hacked

872
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:17,380
us from the UK he's still free because

873
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:21,760
they won't let him go but here's the

874
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:24,280
thing they are working on how to make

875
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,690
this smaller how to make it so we're all

876
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,390
on the same ground but let me tell you

877
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:31,000
truly just like the Geneva Convention

878
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:32,319
who follows what what country follows

879
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:38,770
the Geneva Convention more than anyone

880
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:43,150
else u.s. what about other countries did

881
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:46,060
he follow it nope some do some will

882
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:47,650
argue it's debate but guess what there's

883
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,600
a product out there on the market I've

884
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:51,730
actually read this book several times

885
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:56,230
it's called a talent manual

886
00:35:51,730 --> 00:36:00,250
applicability of cyberwar applicability

887
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:04,030
to cyber war book has 95 governing rules

888
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:07,780
and it governs everything from what's

889
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:10,300
considered attacking someone and causing

890
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:13,080
death using cyber capabilities which is

891
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:15,130
out there by the way any talk about

892
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,600
crossing the boundaries of nation-states

893
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:19,390
which are real basic things make it

894
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:21,040
granular in it and all these countries

895
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:27,700
got together to discuss this by the way

896
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:31,000
this book if you want it on a a digital

897
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:32,049
book it sells for $55 if you want to get

898
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,989
them where they were printed out

899
00:36:32,049 --> 00:36:37,779
95 if you want a full hardback copy sent

900
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:39,130
to your house it's over $500 but I can

901
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:41,589
tell you how to get it for less than it

902
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:43,929
but the point is it's a great book

903
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:47,049
because it talks about in war what do we

904
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:48,729
do now these same folks this group also

905
00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:51,309
came up with cyber operations when they

906
00:36:48,729 --> 00:36:53,649
talk about exactly the same thing what

907
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:55,479
you can do what you can't do what you

908
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:56,589
should do and like any program that

909
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:59,348
tells you these things

910
00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:02,799
guess what becomes the operative word or

911
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:05,739
the operand phrase I know now how to get

912
00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:07,660
around that every that tells you how to

913
00:37:05,739 --> 00:37:10,509
do something or tells you not to do

914
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:12,249
something it can also tell you how to

915
00:37:10,509 --> 00:37:17,309
get around it what they're not looking

916
00:37:12,249 --> 00:37:17,308
at where the loopholes are but ah

917
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,368
emerging technologies what we got their

918
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:23,140
trouble oh yeah we're good we're good

919
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:25,660
emerging technologies it's one of my

920
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:28,058
favorites

921
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:30,279
Matthew graciously went through my brief

922
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:32,829
rather quickly I partially just had just

923
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:36,219
read the first part but one thing that I

924
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:40,779
do at my job I look at current cyber

925
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:43,449
policies current trends current emerging

926
00:37:40,779 --> 00:37:45,579
technologies current threats in industry

927
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:47,049
best practices and I look at these

928
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:48,969
things and I figure out what's the best

929
00:37:47,049 --> 00:37:52,689
one that we can implement and put ahead

930
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:53,369
I couldn't put everything out here but

931
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:59,769
I'll say this

932
00:37:53,369 --> 00:38:01,390
AI first AI doesn't exist a lot of

933
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:02,618
places you go to a lot of companies you

934
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,719
probably belong to they say oh yeah

935
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:08,489
we're doing AI we're doing AI we are not

936
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:14,259
doing AI we're doing predictive analysis

937
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:16,089
we're doing big data analytics we might

938
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:20,529
even be doing expert systems but we are

939
00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:23,439
not doing AI but in the AI bubble

940
00:38:20,529 --> 00:38:24,549
machine learning deep learning big data

941
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:27,609
analytics predictive analysis all of

942
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:31,779
that stuff's there do we need it does

943
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:33,670
everything need AI know some things do

944
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:36,130
some things those not a silver bullet

945
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:38,920
but we need to get accurate because it

946
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:41,859
makes the jobs that we do a lot easier

947
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,569
and it allows us as I said earlier to go

948
00:38:41,859 --> 00:38:45,230
on the offensive because we don't have

949
00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:49,880
to worry about the defensive

950
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:53,600
so much software hardware capability

951
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:57,440
mapping to this does not exist I am

952
00:38:53,600 --> 00:39:01,160
building it however it requires a

953
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:04,280
coordination with PC makers hardware

954
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,960
makers everyone software makers every

955
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,130
product you get mistakes software for

956
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,790
instance because that's what we're

957
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:13,310
talking about person for most before you

958
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:16,430
get that product you should know

959
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:21,020
everything about it how much memory does

960
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:23,419
it take well are its dependencies what

961
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:26,690
does it connect to how much bandwidth

962
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:29,960
does it use that it uses which ports

963
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:32,330
protocols and services what does it mean

964
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,910
a network access is it encryption

965
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:37,700
incapable that and about 20 other things

966
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:40,490
I got a list up and people say well why

967
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:44,149
do you need all of that that defines

968
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:45,919
loops that defines the risk of that

969
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:50,180
product before you even put it on your

970
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:52,400
network that's emerging technology so

971
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:54,290
that makes you locking down your network

972
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,350
a whole lot easier if you're familiar

973
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:58,880
with ia controls and things like that

974
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:02,359
I've watched them grow from a few

975
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,280
hundred to well over a thousand and when

976
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:05,390
you look at that how do you know what

977
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,130
you're looking for and everyone I've

978
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:09,850
spoken to who does that I love you you

979
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:12,230
have done I eat controls before

980
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:15,980
sometimes we look at them ago I don't

981
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:17,390
know it might impact it it might not but

982
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:20,090
if you define it from the beginning and

983
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:23,859
then capability mapping to it it tells

984
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:26,359
you everything about it then you know

985
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:28,369
which means you can tell right off the

986
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:30,340
bat well I can't put that on my network

987
00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:33,320
or I can put it in a certain place

988
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:36,290
blockchain distributing ledger that's

989
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:38,930
pretty simple a lot of times we talk

990
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:40,970
about doing data and things like that

991
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:43,220
and who do we talk to and our customers

992
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:45,109
the best use I could see a distributed

993
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:48,140
ledger outside of the other things I've

994
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:49,490
seen it allows you to talk to people in

995
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:51,830
an unsecure environment people who you

996
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:57,520
don't necessarily trust well but some of

997
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:59,029
them you do DLT is a way to go

998
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,210
geographic we've done it

999
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:07,100
raid storage I see an IBM do this a year

1000
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:11,060
ago it's a raid level system but it's a

1001
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:16,100
big huge storage container and it's

1002
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:20,000
located all over the world when one goes

1003
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:21,470
down guess what you don't skip a beat

1004
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,690
everything is up and running

1005
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:26,509
you're still working a lot of this stuff

1006
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:29,780
we see this was my thought we're gonna

1007
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:31,250
do the cloud now they got that

1008
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,510
particular word for it I'm not going to

1009
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,890
use it because I'm not working for IBM

1010
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:35,660
but that's when I first saw it

1011
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:37,850
hop zero is just pretty much basically

1012
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,799
this hop zero says we can set up your

1013
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:42,230
network to wear it if someone tries to

1014
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:45,100
excellent rate data and you have eight

1015
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:48,200
hops to get to the end of your Enclave

1016
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:49,910
it will die at eight and never ever

1017
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,970
leave your network is it a silver bullet

1018
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:54,440
no it's not but it's a defense and depth

1019
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:57,350
strategy that allows you to secure your

1020
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:00,590
area a little more cyber swarm

1021
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:03,830
technology essentially we're doing that

1022
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:07,190
already or at least C&C is doing it or

1023
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:08,870
the hackers are doing it because we talk

1024
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:12,520
about command and controls and botnets

1025
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:16,150
and zombies that's what they're using

1026
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,150
and guess what

1027
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:24,690
REME allocation is next now meeting

1028
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,580
Kevin Johnson the other Kevin we're

1029
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:30,030
having this discussion if he tries to

1030
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:32,540
tell you that was his word first you can

1031
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:36,060
strangling this what we my location is

1032
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:39,509
where my location is taking malware that

1033
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:42,650
we currently have in using it to get

1034
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:44,850
after operational things we do every day

1035
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:46,590
some so why would you do that I said

1036
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:48,270
it's like viral therapy viral therapy

1037
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:52,800
they take viruses and everything else

1038
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:55,170
and use it to cure diseases with we do

1039
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,720
the same thing with malware we can use

1040
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:59,700
it to get after stuff my web moves

1041
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:02,160
across your networks already and you

1042
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,980
don't know anything about it it

1043
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:08,399
populates fast does it not it gets from

1044
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:10,380
point A to point B it moves quickly now

1045
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,440
I don't know if anyone here works for

1046
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:16,020
tain iam you'll probably want to take me

1047
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,020
to court on this but tell him to me

1048
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:23,310
acts like malware and I'm here to tell

1049
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:25,500
you HB SS with AP of runs HB SS

1050
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:27,570
host-based security system says you got

1051
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:32,160
some hot we're right here to where

1052
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:36,090
tinium has to get an exemption in HB SS

1053
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,069
in order to run but it's able to go

1054
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:39,990
after all these systems all of these

1055
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:42,810
networks there's no agents on these

1056
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:45,149
systems that it needs to go to it goes

1057
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:46,980
oh we go and hit these machines moo moo

1058
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:47,700
moo moo moo moo moo and it's fast it's

1059
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,300
quick

1060
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:53,850
that's reallocation reallocating malware

1061
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:56,250
to do good for us we know it can do bad

1062
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:59,670
we know we can attack the enemy and go

1063
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:01,590
after again a we know all that but what

1064
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:04,590
can it do good for us it's a great

1065
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:07,770
delivery system you gotta love it even

1066
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:10,620
with some malware it can morph itself it

1067
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:12,630
can encrypt itself to protect anyone

1068
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:16,650
from getting at it this technology has

1069
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:19,070
existed for years so now we got to start

1070
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:22,260
opening up old code pulling up old

1071
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:24,330
malware of course in a secured lab

1072
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:26,610
environment let's not introduce it into

1073
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:28,319
the production system if you guys are

1074
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:30,350
thinking about that later but we can

1075
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:33,590
reutilize malware

1076
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:35,450
great things for short mental period of

1077
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:37,670
time companies getting after these kind

1078
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:41,359
of technologies our t-rex cortex Midwest

1079
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:43,550
cyber center Wash U worldwide Tech which

1080
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:46,700
is a Levin point two billion annual they

1081
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:48,260
do a year and future generations helping

1082
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,169
startup get to full operational

1083
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:54,800
capability which leads me to cyber

1084
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:57,850
workforce this is the last area and this

1085
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:01,340
is important right now

1086
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:06,500
there will be over 500,000 unfulfilled

1087
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:08,810
cybersecurity positions by 2021 this is

1088
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,900
a big piece of fighting a cyber war this

1089
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:14,210
is a major piece we need people

1090
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,260
recruiting training retaining the next

1091
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:17,600
generation of cybersecurity

1092
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:19,550
professionals how do we do it

1093
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,290
a lot of companies are getting after

1094
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:23,960
that a lot of companies are doing

1095
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:26,390
exactly that to make sure that next

1096
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:28,130
generation is going after t-rex is it

1097
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:30,009
nonprofit now these places are look I

1098
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:32,630
know here locally but there are others

1099
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:36,530
t-rex a nonprofit technology startup

1100
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:38,210
incubator and enterprise support they're

1101
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:39,650
going after small companies so coming up

1102
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:41,360
with great things and they're helping

1103
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:43,730
them get their product and get their

1104
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,680
service up and running cortex an

1105
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:48,170
innovation community that inspires and

1106
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,240
drives collaboration these are bringing

1107
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:52,550
folks in they're taking folks they tell

1108
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,259
you're first out of college here let's

1109
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,790
get you some training in the cyber world

1110
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:58,460
they're taking folks in there saying hey

1111
00:45:55,790 --> 00:46:00,650
you know what else need a new job your

1112
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:02,690
jobs not working out have you considered

1113
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,110
working in cybersecurity in areas like

1114
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,180
that

1115
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:07,250
why shouldn't university one of my

1116
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:08,960
favorites they are building a cyber

1117
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:12,230
center of excellence they have a

1118
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,870
master's program in cybersecurity in

1119
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:18,620
this year they also have a master's

1120
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:21,380
program in cyber engineering and they

1121
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:22,700
also have a program called round table

1122
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,530
cyber roundtable every month if you've

1123
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,750
never been to it and you consider it

1124
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:29,420
take a look because what they talk about

1125
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:30,920
is everything that we all do in a daily

1126
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:34,190
basis you got in government you got

1127
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:35,810
industry you got different companies you

1128
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:38,720
got individual you got law enforcement

1129
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:40,400
everyone you can imagine is they're all

1130
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,390
talking about the same thing and how

1131
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,109
they get after it

1132
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:47,690
making it better for everybody

1133
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:50,239
worldwide technology like I said eleven

1134
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:52,519
point two billion dollars a year I went

1135
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:54,109
out to sort our facility actually not

1136
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:56,828
too far away from here they do some

1137
00:46:54,109 --> 00:47:00,759
amazing things but what they also do

1138
00:46:56,829 --> 00:47:03,230
they have a stem hackathon for students

1139
00:47:00,759 --> 00:47:06,499
they also have student forums and

1140
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:10,099
workshops these companies are engaging

1141
00:47:06,499 --> 00:47:12,519
the workforce they're engaging who we

1142
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:16,549
need to bring up we're not just making

1143
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:18,140
money we're getting ready for that next

1144
00:47:16,549 --> 00:47:19,880
generation we're trying to fill those

1145
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:22,788
slots as a matter of fact water by

1146
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:32,509
technology speaks of st. Louis as the

1147
00:47:22,789 --> 00:47:33,380
Silicon Valley of the Midwest so that's

1148
00:47:32,509 --> 00:47:34,999
the auto cyberwar

1149
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:36,499
foundation and framework for the

1150
00:47:34,999 --> 00:47:38,259
development tactics techniques and

1151
00:47:36,499 --> 00:47:41,569
procedures

1152
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:41,569
[Applause]

1153
00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:50,910
any questions we have a couple minutes

1154
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,910
nozzle burn yes sir

1155
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:58,359
quantum computing is and in fact it

1156
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:59,710
actually exists I forget what your

1157
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:02,680
company was but I just read it last

1158
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:05,020
weekend and the problem with putting it

1159
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,730
up here unfortunately is kind of goes

1160
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:09,520
off on a tangent it was just a little

1161
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:11,349
bit but yes that's also one of the maze

1162
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,750
but I have something like 200 different

1163
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:17,410
technologies that are going to impact

1164
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:20,050
what we do and how we do it rumor is NSA

1165
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:21,790
out in Utah is exactly what they're

1166
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:23,140
using right now with those millions and

1167
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:29,430
millions of lines of code in a huge

1168
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:29,430
facility yes sir

1169
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:36,470
you're listed rate of Technology out of

1170
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,940
companies that are using these

1171
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:41,689
technologies and building this workforce

1172
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:45,220
you didn't listen you military folks how

1173
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:47,950
reach that gap between the commercial

1174
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:54,700
those jobs knowing that in the military

1175
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:56,799
world they're 170 years behind okay

1176
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,029
that's a tough one and the reason why I

1177
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,300
say it's a tough one member I said this

1178
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:04,570
is a mission impossible it's politics

1179
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:06,400
right now there keep talking about we're

1180
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:08,380
to cut these we need to cut this we're

1181
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,300
spending too much money and then to me

1182
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:12,400
that's the wrong direction to go

1183
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:14,859
you got to hire more people you got to

1184
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,660
spend money you got to engage in the

1185
00:49:14,859 --> 00:49:19,060
emergent technologies where I'm at right

1186
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:21,549
now that's exactly what we're doing the

1187
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:23,380
organization is one by one building into

1188
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:25,540
that so we're hoping it spreads like a

1189
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:27,609
brush fire and that term I use rogue

1190
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:29,440
innovators that's what we're creating

1191
00:49:27,609 --> 00:49:30,970
now in my environment where I work at

1192
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,550
we're building rogue innovators you got

1193
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:35,649
an idea let's see what we have or we can

1194
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:37,450
go with it here's some money here are

1195
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:39,580
some people and then just let it grow

1196
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:43,060
but we're still between the constructs

1197
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:46,410
of leadership and and how people want or

1198
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:46,410
don't want to spend money unfortunately

1199
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:58,690
I'll do it from this perspective we've

1200
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:00,789
got to stop trying to make a bunch of

1201
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:02,769
money and fix the problem

1202
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:04,720
leadership right now and I take the Air

1203
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:06,569
Force for existence everyone that sits

1204
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:10,299
in that leadership position is a pilot

1205
00:50:06,569 --> 00:50:12,099
assume that explain thing in pilotis for

1206
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:14,440
security we should say Security's like

1207
00:50:12,099 --> 00:50:15,339
the wheels on your aircraft do you put

1208
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,130
them on when you're trying to get it

1209
00:50:15,339 --> 00:50:20,019
down the runway or do you boat it on in

1210
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:21,309
the beginning and it's getting those

1211
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:24,519
folks to see it they're starting to

1212
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:26,410
change but literature is a pretty easy

1213
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:27,669
way to stay in forever never never and

1214
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:29,769
get paid all you got to do is keep

1215
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:32,920
kicking the can down the road so we just

1216
00:50:29,769 --> 00:50:36,819
got to get more people in at that middle

1217
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:38,470
tier you're not afraid to say look this

1218
00:50:36,819 --> 00:50:41,589
is what we need to do I can tell you

1219
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:43,419
truly what I just said up there and all

1220
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:45,640
the folks who look at me and say oh hell

1221
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:48,759
no we're not doing that we want to save

1222
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,960
money not spend it you gotta spend the

1223
00:50:48,759 --> 00:50:52,509
money and that's the first thing you

1224
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,430
have to spend the money but you also got

1225
00:50:52,509 --> 00:50:56,650
to have a plan you got to say this is

1226
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:59,109
the requirement this is how we get from

1227
00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:00,670
here to there these are the steps we

1228
00:50:59,109 --> 00:51:02,259
talked about AI and all those different

1229
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:04,089
things there a lot of folks want to jump

1230
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:05,890
into it and do machine learning or they

1231
00:51:04,089 --> 00:51:07,420
want to do deep learning you want to get

1232
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:09,490
some programs and some programmers to

1233
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:12,730
write it which is great but what happens

1234
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:14,680
when it breaks you've now lost positive

1235
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:16,269
control you got to build your processes

1236
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:18,669
this is this this is this this is this

1237
00:51:16,269 --> 00:51:20,140
everything is a gradual process and it

1238
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:22,390
should be reflected in requirements

1239
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:24,069
otherwise you end up like a programs now

1240
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:27,400
called scope creep if you ever heard of

1241
00:51:24,069 --> 00:51:29,230
that everyone's constantly throwing

1242
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,269
stuff at it like you just add this to it

1243
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:33,190
let's snap this and you got to work it

1244
00:51:31,269 --> 00:51:34,868
you just got to do as much as you can

1245
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:38,170
and they got to get more people who

1246
00:51:34,869 --> 00:51:40,359
think the same way it's it's it's a tech

1247
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:45,240
it's a mission impossible but we're

1248
00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:45,240
still gonna do it yes sir

1249
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:54,570
we should I tell you what give me your

1250
00:51:50,950 --> 00:52:04,480
email I'll send it to you sir okay

1251
00:51:54,570 --> 00:52:08,610
or can I give it to you Matthew okay all

1252
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:11,380
right just get it to get to anybody with

1253
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:16,480
Shomi Khan because they'll have a copy

1254
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:21,330
of a copy of it hey you want the house

1255
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,330
ever Kevin Johnson's Chris Evans was
