1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,140
model and so I want to set the stage so

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,820
that when you see that you aren't taken

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,759
aback because it is going to be a slight

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,349
change of pace and a topic but it came

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,139
out of the research that I did for this

6
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,670
main talk so I want to introduce it and

7
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,759
then I want to get feedback from you all

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,199
so talk to me afterwards DM me do

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,470
whatever tell me it's a terrible idea

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,070
come it's the best idea ever I am gonna

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,560
put it forward because I want feedback

12
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:34,290
rate so let's get started you know the

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,480
background I do red teaming the key

14
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,239
thing for me that motivates me to talk

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,578
is I'm anti nihilism anti security

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,649
theater anti wasted time and more

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:47,820
importantly I am Pro risk-based security

18
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:51,030
and what I mean by that is I believe

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,010
that risk can be identified I believe it

20
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,899
can be it can be measured and that I

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,539
believe it can be handled in any number

22
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,190
of ways that we manage risk I am against

23
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,020
the whole sky is always falling

24
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,420
mentality that we often have in this

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,850
industry and so that's why I speak

26
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,590
that's why I teach is because I want

27
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,110
this to be a positive experience and I

28
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,409
think we can make a positive difference

29
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:15,979
as on the side I love Islay whiskies I

30
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:19,049
just put that up there so that if you

31
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:21,450
enjoy the top feel free to buy me a shot

32
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,100
of Eileen whisky if you dislike the talk

33
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,110
and you see me drinking some you can

34
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,210
slap it out of my hand and I'll know

35
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,009
that you did it enjoy it just make sure

36
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,539
it's not a glass cup or something that

37
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,659
could get that could get hairy quickly

38
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:39,150
so let's talk about why you should have

39
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:40,619
a red team first and then we'll walk it

40
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,049
back a little bit and we'll talk about

41
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,610
why it shouldn't be special so you know

42
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,009
the first thing you'll notice there are

43
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,289
a lot of caveats in this talk and this

44
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,869
first slide is no different is the red

45
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,299
team isn't for everybody if you're still

46
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,549
getting wrecked you know in the pen test

47
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,930
in the first 24 hours you don't need a

48
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,720
red team you probably don't even need

49
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,850
pen testing

50
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,640
that point you need you need a base

51
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:06,369
security program but let's say you move

52
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,789
past that and you're not getting rekt in

53
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:12,640
in your standard pen test anymore you

54
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:16,269
have a sock or blue team that needs to

55
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,739
be challenged that needs to involve red

56
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,210
team's are great for doing that because

57
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,760
they can simulate what they're actually

58
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:24,850
going to see and it can help them

59
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:28,600
improve their their time to detection it

60
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:31,060
can fine-tune their processes and they

61
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,560
can simulate what you what attackers are

62
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,250
actually gonna do against you over a

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,020
long over a long term period of time you

64
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,980
especially need a red team if there are

65
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:43,870
full apts in your threat model and you

66
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,420
can use these to justify the security

67
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,130
decisions that you're already making and

68
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,480
asking for but people are saying no to

69
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,850
you you bring in the red team you say

70
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,530
look look what happens when we don't

71
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,030
have this or when we don't do this or

72
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,610
when we don't have these policies in

73
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:01,959
place and people say okay we understand

74
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:05,350
now so you know oftentimes red team's

75
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:08,410
want to be special so I come from a

76
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:11,350
penetration testing background and I

77
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:13,630
know pen testers we think we're special

78
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,670
we think we're the hotness because we're

79
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,769
often treated like we are and so we can

80
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,329
go to our heads we dislike using

81
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:23,080
corporate anything we think we're above

82
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:24,970
it we want to manage our own

83
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:29,110
infrastructure because we do specialized

84
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:30,549
things and we can avoid oversight and

85
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,860
accountability because we are managing

86
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:34,750
our own stuff and sometimes we think

87
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:38,470
we're unhackable and the rules don't

88
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:41,530
apply to us and so you know one thing

89
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:44,709
that one thing that I want to start out

90
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,630
with is is some stories I have to hear

91
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:49,180
that I'm allowed to talk about I always

92
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:53,940
want more so the first one was talking

93
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:56,440
to some folks at AWS and they have seen

94
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,290
groups that do penetration testing

95
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,840
consulting see they're taught their

96
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:05,380
infrastructure compromised and used to

97
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,020
attack their clients and so if that

98
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,650
client sees attack traffic

99
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:13,050
coming from those AWS instances they are

100
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,330
able to differentiate between is and an

101
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:18,030
actual attacker or is it the Consulting

102
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,510
Group another one that I really like is

103
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:23,150
I was talking to someone at a major

104
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:26,340
manage security service provider and

105
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:28,940
they had an incident happen and they

106
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:32,460
went and investigated that incident and

107
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:35,460
it turns out that there was a pen test

108
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:39,270
group who had added a new domain admin

109
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,310
to the to the domain but what they had

110
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:46,169
done is they had used a leet-speak

111
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:48,990
version of the company's name and so

112
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:51,350
what the MSSP was able to do was to go

113
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:54,690
look through all of their other clients

114
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:56,880
domains and identify every single place

115
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,280
this consult this consultancy had been

116
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,280
and it turned out they were using a

117
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,109
similarly speak password and so we know

118
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,520
that pin testers can get lazy and pen

119
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,400
testers often the ones that are going

120
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,109
into red teams eventually and so we need

121
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,159
to protect against ourselves and what we

122
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:19,640
know is some of our our own kind of own

123
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,640
bad behavior that we can fall into so

124
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:27,659
first thing I want to ask is who here

125
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,520
has ever stood up you know to take him

126
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,220
down a rule on a firewall because they

127
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,719
needed to do testing and then forgot to

128
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,350
re-enable that firewall rule when they

129
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,690
were done ok so yeah ok a few people

130
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,950
here and everybody else is lying you

131
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,260
know anybody that's never touched the

132
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,080
firewall and I've never got it right the

133
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:50,340
first time and it's always been right

134
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:53,520
and how many people here can tell me

135
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,229
unequivocally that any system that they

136
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,900
manage that they're responsible for is

137
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,030
currently not compromised has never been

138
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,140
compromised

139
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:04,109
they've never clicked an email they

140
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,490
shouldn't have and they currently are

141
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,260
not putting their organization at risk

142
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,270
in any way anybody want to raise their

143
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,560
hand trust me you will get hired on the

144
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,969
spot if you raise your hand if you are

145
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,470
telling the truth at you raise your hand

146
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,160
you

147
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:20,120
are the best person here to talk to who

148
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:23,030
here has ever asked of their blue team

149
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,800
or if they do consulting why don't they

150
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,469
just do this why don't they just

151
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,660
implement a privileged access manager

152
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,970
why don't they just you know remove

153
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,190
local admin off of all the systems

154
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:37,220
anybody ever say why don't they just do

155
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:39,320
that in their head or out loud I'm just

156
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,720
thinking yeah so I'm going to talk about

157
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,730
why that idea of why don't they just is

158
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,330
one of the the most detrimental things

159
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:49,370
for our industry so these are the

160
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,020
reasons why I think that your red team

161
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:53,480
shouldn't be special is that shadow IT

162
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,609
happens hackers can get hacked and then

163
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,190
there's a lack of empathy that can come

164
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,810
from all of that so you'll remember that

165
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,670
I said at the beginning of my talk that

166
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,320
I'm gonna be talking about something

167
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,730
else called the Red King maturity model

168
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,380
and this is where I'm going to just

169
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,060
quickly introduce it like I said I don't

170
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,890
want it to be jarring the first time I

171
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,200
gave this talk I saw all these confused

172
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:14,120
looks so I'm gonna preface it a lot of

173
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,820
thing I'm gonna talk about this you'll

174
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,280
also notice that it's the darker blue

175
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:21,169
between the other slide so that's your

176
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,780
that's your key to know that I'm talking

177
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:24,770
about the red key maturity model and

178
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,960
this came out of the research I did for

179
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:30,710
this talk and it's really about helping

180
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,810
organizations identify what is right for

181
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,700
them should they be having penetration

182
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,990
testing should they be having red

183
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,120
teaming should they have to be having

184
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:41,300
full-blown adversarial simulations all

185
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,570
the time so there's a spectrum of what

186
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,490
you need as an organization and a great

187
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,520
question that somebody asks when I first

188
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:51,620
postulated this was what should drive

189
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,039
that testing should it be the

190
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:57,260
organizational preparedness such as how

191
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,419
built-out is the sock how developed as

192
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,650
the IR team or should it be the threats

193
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:03,140
in the threat model do they actually

194
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:05,179
have a PPS and so I'll answer those

195
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,580
that's an interesting question that I'll

196
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,100
answer a bit later so now notice the

197
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:13,520
color is changing we're back into the

198
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,550
the main talk so the first reason why I

199
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,169
don't believe

200
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:19,919
that red team should be as special as I

201
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:22,198
think they are is shadow IT so that

202
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,909
happens when red teams or penetration

203
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,610
testing teams manage their own

204
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:28,919
infrastructure they you know they spin

205
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,289
it up for their their c2 management or

206
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:32,819
for their fishing engagements whatever

207
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:34,890
it might be and they're often just given

208
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,959
free rein to do that in AWS digital

209
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,939
ocean or wherever it is and there's not

210
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,708
any oversight there's no auditing or

211
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,680
logging of what's happening of who's

212
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:46,109
doing what I can tell you that I've

213
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,180
worked with or been at multiple

214
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:51,300
penetration testing outfits where we

215
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:53,219
have the same path where we all use the

216
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,589
same password to log into a system that

217
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,140
we test from while we're out there on

218
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:59,790
our closeout calls telling folks you

219
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,100
should be using all this complicated

220
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,930
password rotation software as doing that

221
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,579
for you we're all logging into the same

222
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,410
fishing server using the same username

223
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:11,250
and password with with no

224
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:14,040
non-repudiation over time you have

225
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,079
configuration drift as you have to open

226
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,110
up firewall rules to allow you know

227
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:20,910
maybe specific types of c2 traffic back

228
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,800
because there's there's weird outbound

229
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,779
rules on the on the organization that

230
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,899
you're attacking or internally if you're

231
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:30,360
doing internal testing and so you can

232
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:32,550
get configuration drift over time where

233
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,160
and you forget to go back and modify and

234
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:37,319
put those into a more secure state and

235
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,750
in the end red teams aren't IT

236
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,899
departments I have an offensive guy I

237
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:45,990
will admit to you that they're mostess

238
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:49,170
admins can are better sysadmin than I am

239
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:51,329
I can find they're the few things that

240
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,920
they do wrong and make turn those into a

241
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:54,510
whole incident but that doesn't mean

242
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,790
that I can do their day-to-day job nor

243
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,920
should I try I should work on owning my

244
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,560
offensive skills because red team's

245
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,660
can't they can't test and help with

246
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,939
remediation and continue to hone their

247
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,370
skills and build new infrastructure and

248
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,690
maintain that new infrastructure and do

249
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,100
security monitoring on that

250
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,290
infrastructure once they've set it up

251
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,500
and whatever else you can think of that

252
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,660
a red team needs to do that's a lot and

253
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,990
that's what we're currently asking when

254
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,880
we don't put parameter

255
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,350
around how red teams should operate when

256
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,959
it comes to managing their own

257
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,850
infrastructure or the fact that we're

258
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:33,160
even letting them manage the majority of

259
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:34,810
their own infrastructure so who believes

260
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:39,339
that by being a good hacker that also

261
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:42,489
means you're a good defender cool okay

262
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:45,700
oh we got one back there calculator so I

263
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,930
I do believe that in the you know where

264
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,339
we're headed we do need to have

265
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,250
defenders that are better at doing

266
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:53,110
offensive stuff so we need sock analysts

267
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,029
who when they put out a new new rule or

268
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,649
a new playbook they're able to go test

269
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,149
it themselves they're not depending on

270
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:00,430
the red team to get to it three months

271
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:03,250
down the line so we need blue team

272
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:05,589
members that have offensive offensive

273
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,450
capabilities and we also need offensive

274
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:09,459
folks to understand how the defensive

275
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:14,470
folks are thinking that makes them

276
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:16,569
better at their job and so but as it

277
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,180
stands now being a good hacker does not

278
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:21,310
automatically make you a good defender

279
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,140
it can be difficult if there isn't a

280
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:27,729
division of systems that are being used

281
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:31,089
to tell is somebody testing or are or is

282
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:33,010
their account actually compromised so if

283
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:35,529
you have a tester who uses one single

284
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:36,819
laptop maybe that laptop has a VM on it

285
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,529
with the corporate image that they use

286
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,200
to check your email and all of that if

287
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:45,279
that whole system is compromised can you

288
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,230
confidently as a blue team say that that

289
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,500
you can notice when the activity that

290
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:52,600
they do off of that asset differs from

291
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,220
the activity that they do for their

292
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,839
day-to-day so the testing activity that

293
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,399
they do can you confidently say that you

294
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,740
can identify when that starts to look

295
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:04,470
malicious because they already do kind

296
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:07,209
of both of those things and then there's

297
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,459
there's this mentality that comes from

298
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:11,529
all this so when you're constantly doing

299
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:14,250
mic drop pen tests when you're

300
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:16,720
constantly delivering the bad news you

301
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,190
aren't used to having bad news come to

302
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,680
you you don't want to be told that

303
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,870
you're doing it wrong you can you can

304
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,120
get a little conceited

305
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:27,180
your skills and so this mentality that

306
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,680
comes out of out of having attackers or

307
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,810
offensive minded folks who aren't ever

308
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,229
checked by the organization leads to a

309
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:36,239
lack of empathy and I know it because

310
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,279
I've been there so this is me speaking

311
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,000
from personal experience how many times

312
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:45,630
I've said the term just do this and I

313
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,490
have no context of what that

314
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,490
organization is going through even

315
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:52,170
though I do internal red teaming now

316
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:55,080
it's just now that I understand how

317
00:12:52,170 --> 00:13:00,240
cumbersome a corporate asset is when you

318
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:02,520
have to you know login to privileged

319
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,620
access manager just to get a password to

320
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,360
get into a proxy to try to get outbound

321
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,860
and you still get blocked going to a

322
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,710
site that you have to do for your job

323
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,089
and your system runs you know slow as

324
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:14,160
all get-out because it's running three

325
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:16,529
different types of any virus that aren't

326
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,350
actually achieving their goal once

327
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:22,230
you've experienced that you can start to

328
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:24,450
have an empathy when you say just do

329
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,580
this just turn on this new feature just

330
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,860
buy this new type of software because

331
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:31,020
you yourself are going to have to deal

332
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,459
with the consequences of that so when

333
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,890
you have to deal with the consequence

334
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:38,329
you think twice about what you recommend

335
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:40,500
and you think of more creative ways of

336
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:42,900
implementing solutions to the problems

337
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:47,459
that you identify so we need to balance

338
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:50,430
security with usability also when it

339
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:54,060
comes to things such as building out the

340
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:57,000
infrastructure you you have to interface

341
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,040
with the various groups whether it's

342
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,839
getting a new subnet for yourself

343
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,270
because you want to be isolated from the

344
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,860
rest of the network to do testing but

345
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:09,410
you don't want to go out to AWS and do

346
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:11,850
that you want to keep it internal you

347
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:15,089
excuse me sorry my brain just skipped a

348
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,650
beat there so if you have to do

349
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:19,350
something like that if you have to get a

350
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:21,600
VPN stood up for your your team so that

351
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,610
you can test from the various parts of

352
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,350
the world that you might be in where you

353
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,820
might be on site for an engagement but

354
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,860
you still need to potentially be

355
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,540
monitoring stuff

356
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,730
another location so you can facilitate

357
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,250
that using something like a VPN you have

358
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:37,220
to work with the VPN team if you need

359
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:39,140
the blue team to not monitor the

360
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,930
outbound traffic that you have coming

361
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,910
out of your subnet because you don't

362
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,349
want them to notice your activity before

363
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,510
you actually do it against the rest of

364
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,970
the organization you have to work with

365
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:52,399
them all of that requires you to build

366
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:54,410
relationships and all of those

367
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,050
relationships are critical when it comes

368
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,550
to getting things remediated and so if

369
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,229
you the only time you're ever talking to

370
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,149
folks is when you're telling them that

371
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,040
their baby is ugly they're gonna hate

372
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:08,149
you

373
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:10,089
but if you can if you are having to work

374
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:12,320
with them and build those relationships

375
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:14,089
when you tell them that you're their

376
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,320
baby is ugly they're gonna take it a lot

377
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:17,720
better and you're already gonna have

378
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,250
that that rapport built and so in the

379
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,260
end I think red team's really need to

380
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,120
take their own medication their own

381
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,810
medicine medication sounds a little too

382
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,750
clinical thanked their own medicine cool

383
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:32,989
so let's talk about solutions and what's

384
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:34,640
not the answer is to say well there's

385
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,019
this weird guy and the security

386
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,699
conference I went to once and he was

387
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:39,290
like you're not special stop thinking

388
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:41,750
you're special so here's a corporate

389
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:44,660
asset just like everybody else

390
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,970
go forth and test they're not a admin on

391
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,170
that box that can't even stall VMware

392
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,390
they can't do anything and you're

393
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,319
telling them to go test that is a recipe

394
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,240
for disaster

395
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,709
they aren't thinking anything done and

396
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,800
they're not going to provide you with

397
00:15:54,709 --> 00:16:01,279
any reasonable result the other option

398
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:03,199
is is also the kind of other extreme is

399
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,640
also not a good option like well there

400
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,709
was a strange guy this conference and he

401
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,800
said you shouldn't use a corporate asset

402
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:12,410
so here's a shiny new MacBook and spend

403
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,609
if anything you want at AWS I won't we

404
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:17,329
won't worry about it show us you're

405
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,920
worse also not set up for success based

406
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:20,390
on everything else that I I hope I've

407
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,260
made clear throughout this talk so far

408
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:25,939
and then this last one is should we

409
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,529
should all know that it's bad but you

410
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:32,630
know we still see it pretty often in our

411
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:34,630
industry so what is a good approach so

412
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:36,540
I'm going to talk about good

413
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:40,300
approaches from a general standpoint and

414
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:44,230
then from a technical standpoint so

415
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:46,839
first have red team's lead by example if

416
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:48,280
you are as a red team recommending and

417
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,290
pushing your organization to doing

418
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,000
things like infrastructure as code so

419
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,890
that it can be auditable then the

420
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,590
infrastructure that you stand up should

421
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:58,449
be infrastructure as code you should be

422
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:01,600
already leading the way with using

423
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:03,640
things like terraform or docker or

424
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,480
whatever your whatever you're doing that

425
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,699
you want to see the rest the

426
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,329
organization do you can be that example

427
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:12,850
and you will need you will need

428
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:14,169
exceptions like I said you can't just

429
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:16,030
give somebody a corporate asset and

430
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,189
expect them to do their work their

431
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,660
offensive work so there are gonna be

432
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:22,870
exceptions which they'll talk about

433
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:25,000
I do recommend keeping data on internal

434
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:27,280
infrastructure I put that in quotes

435
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,710
because some people will be like what

436
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,720
about if we're hybrid and use all these

437
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:34,360
cloud words and stuff like I don't care

438
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:39,070
whatever you consider your internal

439
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:42,580
infrastructure keep it on that and then

440
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:44,740
one thing that I love is work to allow

441
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,290
current risk owners to keep owning that

442
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,780
risk so when it comes to for example

443
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:51,909
having a VPN for your Red Team if

444
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,790
there's already a team inside your

445
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:58,480
organization that builds VPNs manages

446
00:17:54,790 --> 00:18:02,470
them and and is owns the risk of having

447
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,780
that that exposure let them keep owning

448
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,370
that the last thing I want is somebody

449
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,780
yelling at me because I did something

450
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,820
wrong I might be like well knows the VPN

451
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:12,399
guys they gave us the VPN they said it

452
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,050
was all good then I can I don't have to

453
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,790
worry about dealing with any fallout if

454
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:17,800
something goes wrong because I have

455
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,389
these different groups that have already

456
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:23,080
thought about it and decided if they

457
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:25,990
they're gonna own that risk so from a

458
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,960
technical standpoint Institute

459
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:30,040
principles of least common mechanism so

460
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,110
this is where we started to get into

461
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,810
exceptions so most folks at our

462
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:35,949
organization they have one laptop if you

463
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,960
have a red team they should probably

464
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,450
have two they should have a

465
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,480
a set that they do all of their email

466
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:45,580
and there I am and all that on and then

467
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,590
they should have a testing laptop where

468
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:50,168
their corporate credentials never touch

469
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:53,168
that thing maybe they have a specific

470
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:55,480
testing domain account if they ever need

471
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:57,580
to start from a point of assumed domain

472
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,830
compromised at whatever level and you

473
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:03,100
give them that user so if you suddenly

474
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:05,260
start to see that testing account going

475
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,850
into places that has never been or in

476
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,700
areas of the network that are not

477
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:11,620
currently in scope for an assessment

478
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,580
then that can raise a red flag but if

479
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,649
you were to have given them the

480
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:17,408
corporate you say use your corporate

481
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:19,270
account to do everything then you aren't

482
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:20,740
going to be able to differentiate as a

483
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,960
blue team between when they're doing

484
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:26,110
offensive testing then if that account

485
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,270
is actually compromised mediated data

486
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:30,010
transfer so because you have these two

487
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,559
separate context you need a way of

488
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:34,539
getting things like screenshots packet

489
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:38,350
captures whatever it might be between

490
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:41,200
the more risky context of the of the

491
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:44,219
testing asset and the corporate asset

492
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:48,190
and the corporate kind of context so

493
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:51,370
using something like secure email or box

494
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,710
or some type of file transfer system

495
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:56,199
where you can log and monitor how data

496
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:59,020
is going from one context to another so

497
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,299
something in the middle not just letting

498
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:04,510
them use the USBs and drag them to drag

499
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:08,379
that stuff back and forth and then apply

500
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:10,200
principles of least privilege so you

501
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:13,270
know on your on their testing laptops

502
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,620
well first off you know any number of

503
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,330
times I've been on an engagement and

504
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,789
I've said well you shouldn't have

505
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:21,549
everybody being a local admin the same

506
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:23,200
should go for testers on your on their

507
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:25,120
testing laptops they should have the

508
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,580
ability to be admin but their default

509
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,080
user should be a low privilege user and

510
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,779
they they know the admin password so

511
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,340
when it's time to install stuff do you

512
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:35,200
know put a network card in for misko's

513
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:38,860
mode they have the ability to do that

514
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,600
but from the get-go they're starting at

515
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,820
a lower

516
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,730
context in case there is compromised in

517
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,710
case they download some exploit and they

518
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,390
don't review it carefully enough and it

519
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,920
ends up popping their box along with the

520
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:56,130
box that they're trying to pop during

521
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:59,550
the assessment so hopefully these good

522
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:02,250
ideas have good outcomes in the general

523
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:04,260
good stuff that will come from it is as

524
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,800
a red team you'll better understand

525
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:12,030
infrastructure policies and procedures

526
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:13,620
when you understand the the massive

527
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,850
mountains that folks have to climb to

528
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,280
get soar an infrastructure in place

529
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:19,740
you'll start to understand where folks

530
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,510
are likely to try to circumvent those

531
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,920
and this could be can be some of the

532
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:27,390
first areas that you look when you're

533
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:28,920
performing an assessment you will start

534
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:31,410
to build relationships with the blue

535
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,970
team and with the other more defensive

536
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,310
and management aspects of the

537
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,630
organization so when it comes time to

538
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:38,460
ask them to remediate something you're

539
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,960
already you're already friends you

540
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,980
already see yourself as being on the

541
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,740
same team again what I love offloading

542
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:49,770
risk to other folks that aren't me that

543
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,350
isn't my team really like that and then

544
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:53,670
you might notice a theme just for good

545
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:56,730
measure I throw it in again you build

546
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:58,280
relationships because I think security

547
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,380
is really about building relationships

548
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:03,090
so that you you can you see yourself as

549
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,250
the same team and not as an antagonistic

550
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:10,679
relationship where you're always trying

551
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:12,930
to one-up each other technically this is

552
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,600
part of a defense-in-depth strategy

553
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:18,300
we're always recommending that to the

554
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,699
folks that we're consulting with or to

555
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,940
our blue team's if we're internal so we

556
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,740
should be performing defense in depth

557
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:28,470
when you start differentiating between

558
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:32,040
these these contexts of testing versus

559
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:34,320
regular activity it lets you utilize the

560
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:37,080
corporate apparatus to log monitor and

561
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,889
differentiate between malicious and and

562
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:42,270
good and good activity and in the end it

563
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,760
lets red teams do what they do best

564
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,080
focus on doing offensive stuff that

565
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,540
wants to manage their infrastructure

566
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,649
they don't have to worry about risk they

567
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:53,200
just get to hack stuff and as a

568
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:55,750
Kaymer that is my utopia of having less

569
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,640
meetings less dealing with my

570
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,230
infrastructure and I just get to just

571
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:04,870
get the poem babe that would be the

572
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:07,630
ideal future so you'll notice it's dark

573
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:10,860
blue so I'm gonna talk real quick about

574
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:14,380
an idea that came out of this research

575
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:17,169
the red team maturity model so this is

576
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,020
how I see a progression of the types of

577
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,950
testing that an organization can have

578
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,389
you know you start with third party

579
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,610
penetration testing maybe it becomes

580
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:28,240
more it becomes more continuous more

581
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:31,419
repetitive and then you get a internal

582
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,070
penetration testing team and then maybe

583
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,470
that turns into an internal red team and

584
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,179
then that red team can then turn into

585
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:43,510
something that's doing ongoing atmos

586
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:46,390
aerial threat simulations so I use these

587
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:49,030
as the indicators to help you identify

588
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:53,350
where you are in that progression so

589
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:54,550
what is your saw capability what are the

590
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:57,040
skill sets of the people that you have

591
00:23:54,550 --> 00:24:00,340
in the offensive capabilities at your

592
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,540
organization what is what do you do you

593
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,570
have the ability to have threat Intel

594
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:08,889
you know I see folks who want to do red

595
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:11,020
teaming but they have no threat Intel so

596
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:12,490
folks are just scouring the news and be

597
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,900
like oh this is a cool hat let's see if

598
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:16,270
my organization is vulnerable to this

599
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,550
that's not an efficient way that doesn't

600
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:20,770
help your blue team build defenses

601
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:23,919
against known threats so you need to

602
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:26,710
have threat Intel that you can feed to

603
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:30,850
the red team so they can do accurate and

604
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:33,940
realistic testing so here's an example

605
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:37,659
of looking at based on your sock

606
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:41,890
capabilities what where you might fall

607
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:42,850
within the maturity model so you know if

608
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,950
you're just doing third party

609
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:47,919
penetration testing you might not have a

610
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,570
sock at this point and that's okay but

611
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:52,420
as you start to do continuous third

612
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:54,399
party penetration testing it should

613
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,360
become a function of IP it might still

614
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,760
be unform alized

615
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,350
and people at least know who to call

616
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,220
when they see certain things go wrong

617
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:04,250
and then let's jump all

618
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,630
down to a red team your socks absolutely

619
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,669
needs to have good coverage throughout

620
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,320
the organization there's no point in

621
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:11,570
having a red team delete hats

622
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,918
if the sock can't go back and be like

623
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,960
well we didn't catch it

624
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:16,580
but we could have if we knew what to

625
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,080
look for and here are some of the things

626
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,059
that we can look forward because we have

627
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,240
the logs we we have the auditing and all

628
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:25,549
of that in place it also makes the red

629
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,220
team it lets them do more complex

630
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:30,470
engagements so they can actually test

631
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:33,169
play books and how the sock responds

632
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:36,320
they can even use how response is done

633
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:38,659
to further their attacks there there

634
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,418
have been engagements that I am familiar

635
00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:44,960
with where folks actually caused an

636
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:46,730
incident to get an IR team involved and

637
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,890
they somehow get themselves to be that

638
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,500
IR team and then they further their

639
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:54,470
attack that way they use the playbook to

640
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,419
elevate privilege and so unless you have

641
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:58,220
a playbook in place for the various

642
00:25:56,419 --> 00:26:02,330
types of instance that you might have

643
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:05,990
then it doesn't the red team can't go as

644
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:09,110
far and can't continue to test those and

645
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:11,350
so this is an example of how you can

646
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:13,250
mature based on where your sock is and

647
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:16,250
it one more example

648
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:18,440
to give you an idea of that is the types

649
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:21,500
of testing that you might see at these

650
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:25,159
different stages so you know when you

651
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:28,190
have those first few stages you have a

652
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:30,380
lot of is scanning based it's overt it's

653
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:32,000
loud and fast and these are just your

654
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,730
general pen tests and your general

655
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,179
assessment when I was doing consulting

656
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:40,280
before I went internal I would have I

657
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:43,580
would have folks who were getting a pen

658
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,470
test done once a year for we had a scope

659
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,449
of one week maybe two if we were lucky

660
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:49,390
saying hey we want you to stimulate an

661
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:53,120
apt we want you to go low and slow I

662
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:55,190
know you understand you have it because

663
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,620
one week and I have to first get

664
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:59,780
familiar with your entire network as to

665
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:02,178
identify where the goods are because you

666
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:04,129
refused to tell me even though we only

667
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:05,270
have one week and you want me to be as

668
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,510
stealthy as possible

669
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:09,960
so understanding where you sit here is

670
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:13,080
important for the type of testing

671
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:15,480
that you asked asked for and so if

672
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:19,949
you're still just doing one pin test you

673
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,630
know a year then you probably don't want

674
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:23,370
somebody trying to go low and slow you

675
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:26,070
want them to have breadth of their

676
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:29,340
findings as you start to get to an

677
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:31,139
internal red team those exercises should

678
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,340
be informed by threat Intel you

679
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,100
shouldn't just be doing the latest

680
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:38,309
greatest hack you should be saying okay

681
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:40,289
we have these known adversaries and we

682
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:41,580
can map them to this you know maybe

683
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:44,460
you're using a tack or something like

684
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:46,439
that we can map them these TTP's over to

685
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,580
attack and we will take those and we'll

686
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,700
try to use them ourselves

687
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:53,520
as a red team to attack our organization

688
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:55,200
and so yeah so this is this is an

689
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,360
example again all these slides will be

690
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,980
available on my github or they are

691
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,678
they've been there for a little bit now

692
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,710
if you want to go look at it in more

693
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,020
detail so I told you that I had a really

694
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:08,549
good question asked of me when I when I

695
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,490
first came out with this idea of the Red

696
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:14,309
Team maturity model and they asked why

697
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:16,649
tie the maturity model to preparedness

698
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:18,570
so how prepared is the stock have

699
00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:21,479
repaired his threat Intel instead of

700
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:23,520
actual threats because if they have a

701
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:27,570
pts in their environment shouldn't they

702
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:30,149
be actually simulating a PT's yeah they

703
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:31,350
should but they aren't ready we we have

704
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:33,570
so many organizations that are behind

705
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:35,340
where they need to be and so what that

706
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:37,320
means is they need to level up quickly

707
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,908
they need to make those investments so

708
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,439
that they can get to internal red

709
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:44,399
teaming they can get to internal

710
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,659
adversary simulations so I kind of went

711
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,830
back and forth when I was first coming

712
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:49,770
up with this and saying how do you

713
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:51,629
measure where you need to be and I do

714
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:53,399
believe right now at least it needs to

715
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,080
be based on the preparedness so you

716
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:57,120
aren't just as a red team you are just

717
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,500
wrecking the blue team pointing fingers

718
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,969
laughing and then doing that over and

719
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,470
over again because you aren't starting

720
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,419
out with kind of the basic things that

721
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:06,500
they need to be overly catch and the

722
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:09,390
basic responses that they need to have

723
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:13,440
so you'll notice it's back to regular

724
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:15,480
blue I'm gonna wrap it up so this idea

725
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,480
that red team shouldn't be special is

726
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:21,149
probably not popular among operators you

727
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,450
know I'm an operator myself I know I

728
00:29:21,149 --> 00:29:24,969
like to feel special

729
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:27,369
I like to do you know headshot pin tests

730
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,480
those type of things and I don't want to

731
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:31,299
do anything that's going to kind of tie

732
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,749
my hands a little bit but we need to

733
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:36,399
take our own medicine and we need to

734
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:38,169
start to build relationships with the

735
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,918
folks that we have to work with to make

736
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:44,080
our organizations better and so some

737
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,269
things I hope to do in the future is map

738
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,649
this the Red Team maturity model to

739
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:49,509
attacks because attack is the hotness

740
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:52,229
right now and I think that could help

741
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:55,359
kind of push it if you have ideas for

742
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:56,559
the Red Team maturity model other ways

743
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:00,070
that I haven't even thought of that I

744
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,450
could I can better recommend to help

745
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,950
folks understand where they are along

746
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,539
that spectrum of the type of testing

747
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:07,539
they need to have please come talk to me

748
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:09,460
I'm by no means that we're the be-all

749
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:11,499
end-all of this type of thought and so I

750
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,940
depend on a community of folks who know

751
00:30:11,499 --> 00:30:15,330
more about certain things that I haven't

752
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:22,080
learned yet so please come talk to me

753
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:24,249
this is my information VM stay open and

754
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,289
this is where you'll find this

755
00:30:24,249 --> 00:30:48,340
presentation along with some other ones

756
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:51,129
I've given any questions yes right yeah

757
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:54,158
so so the question is is there a level

758
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:56,859
zero to this for example if you still

759
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,929
have XP with already P exposed to the

760
00:30:56,859 --> 00:31:02,799
Internet you know do you even need

761
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:05,950
scanning and so answer to that is yes

762
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:08,230
there is but I want to focus on the

763
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:10,090
maturity model on offensively like

764
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:13,330
whatever offensive stuff do you need and

765
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:14,709
I would argue that before that you need

766
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,749
somebody to come in and help start to

767
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,600
build a security program do things like

768
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:20,570
vulnerable

769
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,730
management if your pen test is your

770
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:24,560
vulnerability management program then

771
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:26,140
your vulnerability management program is

772
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,580
way more expensive than it needs to be

773
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:31,220
the the license for any number of

774
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,870
scanners even if it's you can only put

775
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,850
it on one box you can't get like some

776
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:37,129
cloud scanner or whatever with agents

777
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:38,899
deployed across your network if even it

778
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:40,610
was just on one laptop that you have to

779
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,890
maintain that's less expensive than

780
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:45,560
buying a pen test that's going to just

781
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:48,170
run a scanner against you and then wreck

782
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:50,240
you and point fingers and laugh so I do

783
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:52,640
I do think there absolutely is a level

784
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,460
zero so so that's it that's a great

785
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,580
question and another thing that you kind

786
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,930
of said it makes me think is is when we

787
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,730
I don't know if actually want to call it

788
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:04,100
a maturity model I'm thinking about

789
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:07,610
making it more like mist in the sense of

790
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:09,409
of you can kind of choose where you land

791
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:11,929
throughout all these different parts of

792
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,980
it because I think instead of it

793
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,910
because I don't want folks to have a

794
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:18,200
goal of getting to adversary simulations

795
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:20,330
because some organizations never need to

796
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,090
do that if you if you run a small you

797
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:25,330
know local business you might you might

798
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:27,320
only need to go up to you know

799
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:29,000
continuous third party penetration

800
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,159
testing and I want folks to feel like

801
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,020
that's okay based on based on the

802
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,490
threats in the throught model so I have

803
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:37,100
to find a way of doing that better and

804
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:40,240
if anybody has feedback always I really

805
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:43,240
welcome that yeah any other questions

806
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,240
yes

807
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,289
[Music]

808
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:07,080
yeah thank you for that and so yeah so

809
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:08,460
the comment was that it can be difficult

810
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,290
if you will feel like they have to go

811
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:13,800
zero to 100 and they can throw their

812
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:15,840
hands up and then feel disheartened and

813
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,930
I really don't want that I want folks to

814
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,610
to always have hope as you know I try to

815
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:22,860
be a positive person when it comes to

816
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:25,399
this work and so doing anything that can

817
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:27,240
help folks see a see a positive future

818
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,250
it's something that I want to contribute

819
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,610
to so thank you for that any other

820
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,610
questions
