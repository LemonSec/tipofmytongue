1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,370
we like to save the best for the last if

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:11,670
you've come to show me con at any time

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:14,969
you have seen this guy I met Jason 10

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,359
years ago my mentor Ralph fetch from

5
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,560
India introduced me to him years ago

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,560
I've had the honor of speaking in

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,390
Iceland and Romania all over the world

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,229

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,330
is Jason's there and when we start doing

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,540

43
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:10,549
how are we doing it's like I still don't

44
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,140
know what time zone I'm in but I've been

45
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,170
assured its central so we'll just go

46
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:18,290
with that this is the talk I own the I

47
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:21,019
Pony not basically it's the things that

48
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:24,140
I love to do I love for my victims

49
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:26,960
targets clients to to do when I'm

50
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,489
robbing them and three things that I

51
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,900
hate for them to do when I'm robbing

52
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:36,130
them because it makes it harder for me

53
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:38,960
to rob them it's like ah there we go

54
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:43,820
it's like perfect example for a nice

55
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:49,070
offer it's like see you in Vegas

56
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:50,359
DC 8:01 party awesome so you notice how

57
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,780
that doesn't even faze me it's just

58
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,360
life's weird right so a little bit about

59
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,720
me is just all you need to know is that

60
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,920
I do social social engineering security

61
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,560
awareness engagements physical

62
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,480
compromise you can see some of that done

63
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,070
on National Geographic it's like you see

64
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,390
me in the news but more importantly you

65
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,769
see me in your server room on your

66
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,149
surveillance footage in the lower

67
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:14,930
left-hand corner it's like those are

68
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:16,520
actual footage videos or pictures for me

69
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,950
robbing things that's actually a

70
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,560
computer that I took from a teller and

71
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,450
Beirut just walked in didn't even say

72
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,340
hello unplug the computer while they

73
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,310
were doing business beside me and then

74
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,620
walked out

75
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:33,310
that was a finding by the way it's like

76
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,450
that wasn't reported as a finding so so

77
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,190
that's what I do

78
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,859
it's like but I also like to educate

79
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:42,730
it's like that's the key thing I like to

80
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:44,110
do it's like red teaming or penetration

81
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,340
testing whatever you want to call it

82
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,459
whatever you think makes it sound cooler

83
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:51,130
what you do is like it's one basic

84
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:53,500
function your job is to educate the blue

85
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,970
team the defenders the client to make

86
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,920
them better secure at the end of the day

87
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,359
it's like if you go in and you break

88
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,730
into something and it's like and you

89
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,519
like I went in I pushed him in the face

90
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:06,488
and no plan finding you know you've

91
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,220
wasted their time your job there is to

92
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:11,050
defend your job is there is to help

93
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,330
protect the defenders and make the

94
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:17,260
defenders better that's all red team's

95
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:19,299
do is to make the client better and you

96
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,728
see so many different variations of that

97
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:22,900
you know it's like I hear I've go to so

98
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,280
many conferences and I see all these

99
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,638
people talk about like all these obscure

100
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:32,380
and high-tech very very sophisticated

101
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:33,820
attacks and I'm like those are cool but

102
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,169
can I just walk in off the street and

103
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,729
just like you know grab their server

104
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:39,219
it's like I don't know how to do a

105
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:41,770
sequel injection that'll give me the

106
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,770
drop to database it's like that sounds

107
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,060
difficult and complicated I just walk in

108
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,799
the server and I take the hard drive

109
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,960
where the database is and I walk out

110
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,030
with it it's a little bit easier for me

111
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,049
it's like you know for each their own so

112
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,450
it's like we hear about all these

113
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,010
high-level attacks but we're not talking

114
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:00,070
about some of the basic low-level stuff

115
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,900
that gets everybody it's like and when

116
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,669
red teams come in they do a disservice

117
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,109
to their clients because they go in and

118
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:06,549
saying oh we went through the ceiling

119
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,410
panel and stuff you know and we use some

120
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,060
freon gas to open up the motion sensor

121
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,130
and it's like two roped in it's like

122
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,210
that we took a picture of a from a jelly

123
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,070
belly and stuff you know I was able to

124
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,400
fool the biometric thing and get into

125
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:21,130
like that and then the clients like

126
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,419
thank goodness we're safe because that's

127
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,710
like a high level I mean you were like

128
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:25,570
ninjas aside we don't have to work

129
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,940
that's not our threat model we don't

130
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,190
have to worry about that it's like so

131
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,840
we're cool it's like y'all guys were

132
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,660
like awesome you are ninjas it's like

133
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,099
weird

134
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,900
threat models not ninjas or

135
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,800
nation-states it's like it's a whole

136
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,210
East nation-states

137
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,840
but still it's like we don't to worry

138
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:45,109
about that it's like so what I try to do

139
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,020
is I try to remove all of that it's like

140
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,310
I go in and say I never been in this

141
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,229
building before I didn't know who the

142
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,940
manager of the people were I walked in

143
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,890
on the first minute within 2 minutes and

144
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,000
22 seconds I'm now behind your teller

145
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,120
line and I have full access to

146
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,850
everything in your bank that's a problem

147
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,610
it's like they don't have any answer for

148
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:07,070
that because you can't just walk that

149
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,570
away it's like you can't just want this

150
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,900
so that's why I like to do it the easy

151
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,330
way

152
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,650
it's like it's not that I can't do it

153
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,940
see I've had to do some jobs where it's

154
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:17,510
a little bit more sophisticated than

155
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,460
that not by much okay but it's a little

156
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,230
bit more but it's like I like to do the

157
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,450
most basic so it's like there's no

158
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,270
defense for it and then we have another

159
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:29,300
problem in information security and

160
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,680
that's what we need it's like what we're

161
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,330
trying to build you know your executive

162
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,800
management it's like the picture on the

163
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:41,359
last light that's what we need build

164
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,100
that protect us it's like anyway sure we

165
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,120
can do that it's like what's our budget

166
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:49,940
well we can afford what's on the right

167
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,280
okay we need what's on the left but we

168
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,440
can afford what's on the right do your

169
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,239
best

170
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,219
lose your job if you don't it's like but

171
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,650
do your best right it's like that's what

172
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:03,830
we have to deal with it's like so I want

173
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,989
to give some basic advice it's like I

174
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,219
mean every accuses me of being basic

175
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,890
anyway but it's like I want to give some

176
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,720
basic advice on what we can do to better

177
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:15,469
protect ourselves that you can take back

178
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:18,110
today to help with and so one of the

179
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:20,990
things that I love more than anything

180
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:24,530
else that I cherish beyond all measure

181
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:27,530
is employees not empowered or educated

182
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:30,530
to question the unusual that gets me

183
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,090
every single time into a building into a

184
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,460
site into a server room into the

185
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:37,789
computer into a network and into the

186
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,469
jackpot it's like I was on and again and

187
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:44,129
I tell you it's like and what I mean by

188
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:48,259
that is there's nothing worse there's

189
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:50,550
than a false sense of security right I

190
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,779
think so it's like everybody thinks it's

191
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,689
like everything's to protect and I'm

192
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:57,058
like no no it's like there is something

193
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:58,949
worse than that it's like it's like not

194
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,209
no security but that false sense of

195
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:02,219
security it's like that's what the

196
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:03,899
problem is people going in and thinking

197
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:05,669
that oh you got to go through there's

198
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:09,419
physical guards at our doors

199
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:12,628
we've got RFID badges it's like we got

200
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:14,549
can secure two areas it's like so if

201
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:17,729
someone's inside there they must be

202
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:20,249
trusted and so therefore when I come in

203
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:22,199
with a clipboard or it can work shirt

204
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:26,759
saying I needed something I'm trusted I

205
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:28,649
must be okay no I'm never okay it's like

206
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,889
but people act that way I was on a job

207
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:35,159
in January it was a very secure facility

208
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:37,289
it's like I had a I dressed in the

209
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,789
jacket so it's like and I dressed a

210
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:41,039
little bit like the rest of the

211
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:43,318
everybody and so I came in and I told

212
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,740
him like hey I'm with IT we're checking

213
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:48,420
the USB rights on your computers because

214
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,089
you shouldn't be charging your phones or

215
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,610
devices from the computer you should be

216
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:54,959
charging the devices from the outlet so

217
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,779
we're doing this USB rights to make sure

218
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,750
that that can happen and I have a cable

219
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:03,420
an iPhone lightning charger cable there

220
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:06,240
is no phone attached to this cable it is

221
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,610
just the cable and I plug it into their

222
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,889
computer and then I pull this detonator

223
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,240
out of my jacket and I swear to goodness

224
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:14,009
it looks just like a debtor little

225
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,290
square box a little light and then aunt

226
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:17,970
Anna and I didn't have to pull it out

227
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,529
but I did it for a fact because I wanted

228
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:23,130
to get caught I wanted them to question

229
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:26,899
it I pulled out the detonator I didn't

230
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:31,019
say boo okay I was tempted but I did not

231
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:33,569
okay so and it's like and all of a

232
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:37,319
sudden notepad pops up on their screen

233
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:38,759
it automagically Tikes out test

234

for your cooperation it's like I'll do

239
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:54,280
that eight people in the same area no

240
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:58,329
one questioned me how my table

241
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:00,250
activated their notepad I go back

242
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,780
because I do like I said I do security

243
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,900
awareness engagements it's like I don't

244
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,490
just it's not useful if they're not

245
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,350
educated they're not understanding right

246
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,480
then and there on that day when the

247
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,910
impact is still fresh that something

248
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,770
went wrong so I go back to them after

249
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:18,640
the engagement is over and I go back to

250
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:19,860
each person and I question them say did

251
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,470
you find anyone

252
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:26,500
just a teeny just keeping it and it's

253
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,540
like yeah yeah now that you mention it

254
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,700
it's like I thought it was a little

255
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,260
weird it's like but I didn't want I

256
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,520
didn't want to feel like I didn't want

257
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,650
to interrupt it's like I didn't want to

258
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,750
like cause any problems like no call

259
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,910
submitting trouble it's like that's okay

260
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,860
it's like caused a ruckus some guy just

261
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,290
came and plug the cable in and somehow

262
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:47,070
your notepad activated that's sketchy AF

263
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:49,569
you should be talking to somebody okay

264
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,610
so it's like so that's what we need to

265
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,680
do we need to empower our users that

266
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,530
it's okay for them to question when

267
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:00,640
something unusual happens you are not

268
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:03,040
having every day of your job weird

269
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,660
things like that happening it's like and

270
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,390
if you are check yourself you may be on

271
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,370
lady sitcom but if you're not it's like

272
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,660
it's like then you need to question and

273
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,730
you need to contact security

274
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:16,270
you need to let them know hey this was

275
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:18,730
really weird what's happening one of the

276
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,890
things I hate it's like I'm not talking

277
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,720
about this guy technically but it's like

278
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,400
is open lobbies faces I mean let's face

279
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,260
time I don't know this is what the CIA

280
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,550
lobby looks like because trust me if I

281
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,930
ever visit its gonna be going through

282
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,540
the back door with the bag over my head

283
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:33,339
it's like I'm pretty sure it's like I'm

284
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,069
on a lot of lists for some reason all

285
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:37,870
right so I know exactly why but but so

286
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:41,080
public faces are well monitored highly

287
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,910
visible I hate those kind of spaces it

288
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,940
is so hard to loiter in those spaces

289
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:48,939
it's so hard to case to place in those

290
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:52,150
spaces it's so hard to not be getting

291
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:55,390
attention in those kind of spaces so I

292
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:57,610
was a this is no past November I was in

293
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,170
Moscow it's like I'm reading the faces

294
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,860
so I know where the feds are okay good

295
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,890
Gotham and

296
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,990
I was a asked to visit because firsties

297
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,120
headquarters because I think his Percy's

298
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:11,180
a friend of mine and yes I'm now on

299
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,830
another list I'm sure but but so I was

300
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,630
invited I was in Moscow so I decided to

301
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:17,060
go and visit the headquarters and I am

302
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,350
telling you as soon as I walked in the

303
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,180
door it's like it was like it was an

304
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,650
open environment but there's this nice

305
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,359
couch there and I'm one of those guys

306
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:25,699
it's like when they even when I'm not on

307
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,260
the clock that I can't go off the clock

308
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,180
you know I still gotta think like what

309
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,010
could I do here to cause destruction you

310
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,349
know it's like it's just a habit okay

311
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:35,210
I don't actively cause the described

312
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,700
destruction I don't actively go and do

313
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:40,400
the bad things but I can't help thinking

314
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,900
about it right so I decided instead of

315
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,579
just going straight to the reception

316
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,840
Stefan's checking it's like I'm just

317
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,460
gonna sit down and check it out and see

318
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,160
what see what the layout is you know sex

319
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:51,530
I think that'd be cool it's like man as

320
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,980
soon as my butt touched leather on that

321
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:56,120
on that couch this big security guy I'm

322
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,820
pretty sure his name was Ivan you know

323
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,950
just walks over he's like excuse me

324
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:04,070
comrade couldn't he didn't say comrade

325
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:05,840
but you know it's like uh how can I help

326
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,640
you today it's like do you need to

327
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,150
register with someone or you do you have

328
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,930
an appointment

329
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:13,459
very polite okay but when your muscles

330
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,599
have muscles you're allowed to be polite

331
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,670
and no matter which way you want to do

332
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,900
it okay right it's like I mean he was

333
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,520
literally wearing these these black

334
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,410
trousers and this shirt that was like

335
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,939
either two times too small or if muscles

336
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,069
four times too big for it I don't know

337
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:27,530
which but it's like but he was very

338
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,840
polite and he guided me he was so

339
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:32,270
helpful and guided me straight to the

340
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,520
receptionist desk so I could check in

341
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,920
and validate that I was supposed to be

342
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,980
there in the first place and that my

343
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,589
friends is exactly how you do it it's

344
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:45,140
like there was no confrontation there

345
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:46,490
was no obvious like you know I've been

346
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,800
being distressed or there was something

347
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:51,380
that I can complain about it was like he

348
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,880
was doing it as a service like I'm

349
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,710
helping you it's like I'm trying to be

350
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,920
nice but at the same time letting me

351
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,570
know

352
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,849
mother you ain't getting away with this

353
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,770
it's like you need to kill register it's

354
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:03,020
like and that's how your buildings are

355
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:04,460
supposed to be it's like that's how your

356
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,199
lobbies are supposed to be it's like

357
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,540
they're supposed to be where people are

358
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,250
registering and then waiting for the but

359
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,889
they're not just loitering they should

360
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,689
be registered and accounted

361
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:15,639
for as soon as they get into your

362
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:18,879
facility so you can account for where

363
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:21,189
they are at all times so that was well

364
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,959
done on the I on their part and it's

365
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:26,108
like it was a really cool tour was like

366
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,429
really nice facility so I'm gonna get

367
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:30,910
out of that because I'm probably in more

368
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:34,269
trouble one of the things I love is no

369
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:37,269
ingress filtering or internal monitoring

370
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:39,069
and we got to talk about fails it's like

371
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:41,829
I can't help but add the TSA because

372
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:42,759
they provide so much examples of bad for

373
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:44,769
me

374
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:46,720
and then this one it gives it a TSA a

375
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:49,410
just missed mock weapons more than

376
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,220
seventy percent of the time

377
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:57,699
seventy percent of time you had one job

378
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:59,829
right tonight and I bet you their main

379
00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:01,660
excuse is gonna be it's like yeah but no

380
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:06,729
four ounces a toothpaste made it past

381
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:08,679
did it so there it's on okay the

382
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,799
battle-axe and the bachelors may be okay

383
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:15,249
but no four ounces the toothpaste that's

384
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:17,739
a line we're not gonna cross so that's

385
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:20,169
one of our biggest problems is that

386
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:21,459
we're having our people it's like we're

387
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,470
building the security we're thinking

388
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:25,529
like let's make sure our firewalls

389
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:28,360
blocking all activity coming out or

390
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:31,989
going in make sure that we've got that

391
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:34,059
hardened perimeter but then when it

392
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:37,119
comes about you know outbound traffic

393
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:40,169
any any no monitoring because you know

394
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:43,299
it's trusted it's coming from inside

395
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:45,249
coming from inside the house okay

396
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:48,730
how do you not watched me horror movies

397
00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:51,160
ever right and more so now than ever

398
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:55,839
your attacks your actual point of

399
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:58,179
ingress is that compromised machine in

400
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,279
the counting it's like that's been

401
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:03,039
compromised and now using the controls

402
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:05,529
that you put in place to then connect to

403
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,809
the command and control and compromise

404
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:10,509
your internal network and then I mean

405
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:11,949
look at Sony it's like seriously I mean

406
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:13,180
not most of the movies lately but still

407
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:17,649
the come

408
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:22,520
they lost over one terabyte of data

409
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:25,430
during their breach how do you miss one

410
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,670
terabyte of data leaving your network to

411
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:30,739
Paraguay it's like it wherever it went

412
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:32,390
that's a little odd right just a little

413
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,220
bit I mean even from a network

414
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,810
standpoint I mean what did they do the

415
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,459
network guys go see all that traffic

416
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,719
leaving the line oh we need to increase

417
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:42,709
the bandwidth on this it's like there

418
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,020
seems to be a lot of traffic why why

419
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:48,170
wasn't security looking that going maybe

420
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,939
we should check that out Bob you know is

421
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,589
like has never really released you know

422
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:54,850
one terabyte of data going to South

423
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:57,350
America maybe we should check into that

424
00:16:54,850 --> 00:17:00,470
you should be monitoring and fielding

425
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:03,290
your no one should be able to connect

426
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:05,270
outside that network unless it's from a

427
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:08,510
policy procedure that backs it up on the

428
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,949
firewall rule it's like I one of the pay

429
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,420
lives that I use on my Bosch bunny

430
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:13,550
because I don't do I don't do

431
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,650
compromises I don't do exploits I do

432
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:18,230
security awareness things one of my

433
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,660
security awareness things is basically I

434
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:23,079
hope I plug in the Bosch money it opens

435
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:27,620
up command prompt it types in telnet to

436
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:29,659
Towell blinky lights Titan l and all of

437
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:32,050
a sudden in the command prompt you see

438
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,340
Star Wars and ASCII it's like playing

439
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:37,730
animated it's like through your telnet

440
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:39,500
which is really sort of cool except for

441
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,050
the fact you should not have telnet

442
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:45,170
going to the Netherlands it's like on

443
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:47,720
your accountants computer correct

444
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:49,990
am I crazy well yes I am crazy but still

445
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,970
is that that's crazy

446
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:56,360
why is your accountant that allowed to

447
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:59,510
go telnet to the Netherlands and why

448
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,729
isn't there someone at my desk when I'm

449
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:04,879
there within five minutes asking that

450
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:07,250
question because there's no proper

451
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,140
egress filtering we're not monitoring

452
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,210
what's leaving our network we're so

453
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,590
concerned about what's coming in it's

454
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,880
like you're so busy trying to build the

455
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,720
walls it's like we got to build a wall

456
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,269
make it bigger

457
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,669
China apt is gonna pay for

458
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:20,289
it's like well guess why it's like

459
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:22,139
they're going over that and then they're

460
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:24,219
just walking out the front door and

461
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:25,928
we're letting them because we're not

462
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:27,669
monitoring what's leaving our doors

463
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:31,690
we're just so busy trying to barricade

464
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:35,109
them so one of the things I really hate

465
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:36,309
it's like not not not sneakers I'm not

466
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:37,809
hating on sneakers sneakers it's a good

467
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:40,418
movie though don't start getting flame

468
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:45,190
wars on me but dual factor

469
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:47,799
authentication that's a problem it's

470
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:50,709
like to get to deal with right it's like

471
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:52,479
because I love doors that are just like

472
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:54,609
it'll just open up or the pin pads those

473
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:57,399
are nice it's like but when you put an

474
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:58,928
RFID or a hid badge which I could easily

475
00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:01,809
clone with the proc smart or a boss

476
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:04,659
cloner it's like that's awesome but then

477
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:07,809
you put that pesky peek keypad there and

478
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:10,329
I'm like mother it's like that's not

479
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:12,009
cool that's not playing fair I'm trying

480
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:14,049
to rob you all nice and stuff and you're

481
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:16,179
being difficult it's like you know

482
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:18,369
where's the fun in that well for me

483
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:20,709
anyway right it's like and so I have to

484
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:24,279
give you one of the same story that I

485
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:26,499
did about the cable back in January they

486
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:28,839
did something very cool and mean to me

487
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:30,459
it's like I took all the time all the

488
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:32,229
time in trouble to sneak into their

489
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:36,070
facility going through the freight

490
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:38,799
elevator and they had a security pad and

491
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:40,208
card in the freight elevator entrance

492
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,429
lobby so it's like they created their

493
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:44,919
own little Lobby inside that couldn't I

494
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:46,059
couldn't get in I mean it took me 13

495
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:48,429
minutes and act like I was on the phone

496
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:50,229
till an employee let me in but I got in

497
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:53,289
and I'm like ah so I'm in the section

498
00:19:50,229 --> 00:19:56,349
I'm like I'm getting ice cream right and

499
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:58,329
so until I decided to leave that one

500
00:19:56,349 --> 00:20:02,019
section they owned the whole floor they

501
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:05,859
own two floors in this building so I get

502
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:09,309
to the glass door and I'm like it's like

503
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:13,269
oh that's a I can't go anywhere else but

504
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:16,629
this section you have to badge into each

505
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:19,570
part of the buildings floor even though

506
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:21,939
you're it's the same company they still

507
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:25,658
leave segmented the actual floor what

508
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:27,369
the actual you know that's not cool I

509
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:28,360
mean it was cool because I was able to

510
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:30,159
steal someone's badge

511
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,370
they left there on their desk it's like

512
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:36,549
and then get in but at first I panicked

513
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:38,409
that wasn't nice it's like so but then

514
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:40,210
they segment but they segmented it and

515
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,400
it took multi-factor authentication I

516
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,830
love people that I've done so many

517
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,250
different banks and gone into their main

518
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:51,040
headquarters and it's like anju me to do

519
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,270
million dollar wire transfers it's not a

520
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,780
simple process

521
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:57,429
that's some serious business right it's

522
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,260
like they need to protect that stuff you

523
00:20:57,429 --> 00:21:01,750
need a protector ID you need to own that

524
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,809
identity that you did that so that you

525
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:08,559
have you a USB keys you have a key that

526
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:10,840
you have to plug into the computer has

527
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,540
there ever been a time I have not found

528
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,668
a USB key already connected to the

529
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,399
computer when I came in to steal it it's

530
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:21,460
like the answer is no it's like every

531
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:25,110
single effing time it's like if it's not

532
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:28,890
on the computer that's okay don't panic

533
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:31,629
open up the middle drawer right there

534
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:33,900
it's like so you've got to make sure

535
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,830
that you have two-factor authentication

536
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,929
but you got to make sure that it's an

537
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,220
actual two-factor it's like you gotta

538
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,919
make sure that's actually going to

539
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,299
actually be used in a secure way it's

540
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,040
like so but those are the things that

541
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:48,070
that really pisses me off it's like I do

542
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:52,030
have a problem with that now the next

543
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:54,760
thing it's like I love people that don't

544
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:56,410
follow established procedures everybody

545
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,850
says we have a procedure against that or

546
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:00,240
that's against company policy it's like

547
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:03,309
oh I know it is it's like but here I am

548
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,929
right it's like and this is a great

549
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:06,610
story about sorry for everybody that's

550
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:07,450
in the Air Force you know sorry hashtag

551
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,479
sorry not sorry

552
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:13,450
but uh this was actually on Ellis Air

553
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,130
Force Base in Nevada it's like two

554
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,260
civilians somehow breached an Air Force

555
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,910
Base and were found only when one of

556
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:25,179
them told the airmen she'd been

557
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:27,280
kidnapped her attacker grabbed her put

558
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:29,770
her in the car and just started driving

559
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,840
it's like we're leaving it's like here's

560
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:33,870
a good road well I'm gonna like you know

561
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,800
hide this I've got to find a place to

562
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:38,080
ditch her and like you

563
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,370
and hide the body it's like well here's

564
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,840
this an abandoned area so it seems

565
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:43,659
pretty the band and let me just drive in

566
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,429
didn't stop at the gate the guard didn't

567
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,830
go that's odd

568
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:51,190
that car it was a civilian car didn't

569
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:53,199
check in seems legit it's like let's not

570
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,730
bother reporting that it's like and then

571
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,620
the guy got on the base then he realized

572
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:58,720
oh wait I made a horrible decision

573
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:01,000
you've made several by that point buddy

574
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,190
it's like and so it starts trying to

575
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,440
drive around and was able to stop she

576
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,090
was able to get out and escape at that

577
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,250
moment and was able to talk to the

578
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:11,199
guards it's like and notify them the

579
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:14,350
fact that it's like I think someone

580
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,030
broke a procedure here or two I don't

581
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:18,310
think she said that it's like but that's

582
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:20,620
what happened and it's like you got

583
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:22,960
established procedures it's like for a

584
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,850
reason security has procedures for a

585
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,470
reason another good story that I have to

586
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,510
say because it's really funny once again

587
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,650
at the expense at the Air Force it's

588
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,480
like I have nothing it's the Air Force

589
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:34,420
it's like I I make fun of everybody

590
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:38,530
equally but it's like there was this one

591
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:42,370
where back during the Cold War a Russian

592
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:47,889
agent drove up onto a u.s. airbase in

593
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:50,830
Germany he then proceeded to walk up to

594
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:55,210
a plane that had a missile attached to

595
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:57,429
it he detached the missile it's like put

596
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,720
it in a wheelbarrow I don't know if he

597
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:01,540
stole the wheelbarrow too but I really

598
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,780
hope he did ok it's like put it in a

599
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:06,490
wheelbarrow willed it to his Mercedes

600
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:09,450
it's like we're in Germany after all

601
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:13,150
right he put it in the backseat I

602
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:14,410
attached a red flag to the tip because

603
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,110
it was sticking out of the window and

604
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:20,610
German laws are German laws okay it's

605
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:23,740
like and drove home to his apartment

606
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:25,629
disassembled the missile it's like and

607
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,900
mailed every piece back to Mother Russia

608
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:30,370
and I mean the the German metal system

609
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,770
is impeccable it's like every piece got

610
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:35,469
back there ok it was like it was just

611
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:37,600
insane I think there were some policies

612
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,730
that weren't enforced there either it's

613
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,770
like your policies aren't good unless

614
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:44,020
people know that you're going to enforce

615
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:47,440
them your policies are not good unless

616
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:49,210
your executives own up to them

617
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,250
are part of them and are responsible for

618
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:53,440
them as well it's like if your

619
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:55,840
executives don't have to follow your

620
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,110
policies congratulations you have no

621
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,149
policies it's like if your executives

622
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:03,399
are exempt from your security procedures

623
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:07,000
guess what you have no security

624
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:09,850
procedures you have a wish list that's

625
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,620
like that the the chumps use okay and

626
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:13,178
then other people go well I report to

627
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,100
that guy so I don't have to follow those

628
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,600
either and then those people go why

629
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,279
report to that guy who reports to that

630
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,110
guy who reports to that guy so I don't

631
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:21,610
have to follow them either and the only

632
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:23,019
one that fallen on this like you know ed

633
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:24,789
and stuff you know in the mailroom go on

634
00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:26,500
oh well at least I got my steak we're on

635
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:28,620
halal these policies you know it's like

636
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,570
that's not gonna work out well for you

637
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:34,330
okay you have to make sure your policies

638
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:36,340
and procedures are there they're

639
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:38,230
enforced and people are aware of them

640
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,389
you have to make sure that happens

641
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,980
because if they don't understand that

642
00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:43,959
and they don't believe that they have to

643
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:48,970
follow those policies then you've got

644
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:51,009
really not much of anything now this was

645
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:52,269
sort of my education part a ramp part of

646
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:54,039
there and it's like you're asking

647
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:56,049
yourselves like what exactly is the

648
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:58,059
point of this it's like what one of the

649
00:25:56,049 --> 00:25:59,230
part is to educate it's like to tell you

650
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:02,309
about some of the things that I like

651
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:05,080
about that but now I want you to know

652
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:08,289
some of the questions you should be

653
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,870
asking your work area your space your

654
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:12,370
employers your enterprise your wherever

655
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:14,110
you're working or whoever pays you a

656
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,908
paycheck it's like here are some

657
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:18,939
questions you need to take back to your

658
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:25,600
users and to your security team it's

659
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:26,830
like here's some questions it's fruit

660
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,669
for you

661
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:34,659
like for one really inside of threats

662
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:36,610
which one fits the bill do you really

663
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:39,610
understand what an insider threat is is

664
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:41,560
it really just a it's a really just the

665
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:43,479
the malicious actor like Robert hands

666
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,190
wouldn't say and and I like the feds

667
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,320
going right now why is he always picking

668
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:50,680
us it's like this put me off the list

669
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:53,110
then maybe okay it's like so it's like

670
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:56,230
so maybe it's a malicious insider threat

671
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:58,629
or let's be honest sometimes it's just

672
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:00,850
stupidity like on the right it's like

673
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:06,070
and I love this fact it's like on the

674
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:10,510
right the TSA devolves willingly for an

675
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:13,899
article all the print for their keys so

676
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:16,300
you can make duplicates of them now

677
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,970
that's sort of bad because that opens up

678
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:21,669
all your luggage all your secured

679
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:23,890
devices can now be opened up by anybody

680
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:26,080
a luggage handler anywhere around the

681
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:29,650
world because they can 3d print those

682
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,179
things when asked about it and accused

683
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:33,610
about like how dare you what what are

684
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,380
you doing the government the same

685
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,510
government who wants the keys to all

686
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,490
your mobile devices for your encryption

687
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:40,960
keys when well that's not really a

688
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:42,580
security practice we don't really care

689
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,500
it's like too bad that the keys are out

690
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,870
there but you know that's not our

691
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,090
problem sure I want you to have my

692
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:51,580
encryption keys now yes that instills me

693
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:54,250
with so much confidence it's like so

694
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:57,520
that is a threat vector

695
00:27:54,250 --> 00:28:00,730
those are both insider threats one was

696
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,830
malicious one was actively trying to

697
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:05,830
destroy your network trying to do damage

698
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:09,310
to your company the other one just did

699
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:10,780
it by accident if your company goes out

700
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,179
of business because of one or the other

701
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,950
does it really matter which one it was

702
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:18,190
you should be preparing and protecting

703
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:21,330
for both and also if you're going to do

704
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:24,760
that it's like you need to understand

705
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:27,010
it's like when that threat happens how

706
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,990
you respond to this I call this the fail

707
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:31,150
burrito I added this slide this morning

708
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,310
at 6:30 something it's like I don't know

709
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:36,020
if you're aware of

710
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:38,879
Border Patrol have a employee a

711
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:43,139
contractor who against company policy

712
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:46,110
and procedures copied over 500 gigs of

713
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,000
data off the Homeland Security's

714
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:51,209
computer network which was against their

715
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,190
policy and what do they do they put it

716
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:57,150
on their network which was then breached

717
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:58,950
and then downloaded and the Homeland

718
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:01,220
Security you know being the wonderful

719
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:03,750
responsive government entities they are

720
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,220
set out a thing going I send out a press

721
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,650
release going like we're not going to

722
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,900
divulge who it is but we're talking to

723
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,760
omens like we scanned the dark web and

724
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,840
I'm sure that when when marketing heard

725
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,490
this like they skin their she's always

726
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,679
kind of it sounds cool just leave it

727
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:18,800
that way okay it's like we scanned the

728
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,510
dark web it's like we found no traces

729
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,399
everybody's safe don't worry nothing to

730
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,960
see here and the documents they release

731
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,890
it on the metadata showed exactly what

732
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,780
company was so good job on that one and

733
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,550
then Justin Cox here was like able to go

734
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,200
really he's getting the dark web that

735
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:36,600
sounds like a great idea let me try oh

736
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,070
look here's the 500 gigs of data you

737
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,990
said that you scan the dark web for I

738
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,970
found it within five minutes maybe you

739
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,070
should look into that I mean I call this

740
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:45,870
the fail burrito because you put a

741
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,820
little bit of fail here and then you add

742
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,199
some more fail you wrap it up and fail

743
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,280
and it's like whatever you do just look

744
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,530
at it don't eat it because you're gonna

745
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,570
get sick okay but it's like that's what

746
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:56,910
they did and it's like so thank you

747
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:58,500
border control and homeland security for

748
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:02,370
once again providing us what we're not

749
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:05,340
supposed to do on anything so that's an

750
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:07,290
issue right there it's like that's an

751
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:10,110
issue because that's once again your

752
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:11,750
data and what's gonna happen well those

753
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:14,429
contractors are going to learn a lesson

754
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:16,890
those contractors are going to frickin

755
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:18,750
pay the penalties they're gonna have to

756
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:20,250
deal with the repercussions that I'm

757
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,660
joking that they're fine it's like

758
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,280
they're still doing business with them

759
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:25,080
there's like they're like don't do that

760
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:29,670
again and they're good it's like that's

761
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:31,169
what's going on right now so yay one of

762
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:33,330
the other things you do how do you ask

763
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:37,170
for an identification who do you ask and

764
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:40,949
how do you ask which one of these people

765
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:43,560
would you ask for identification the

766
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:45,030
answer is all of them it's like I do it

767
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:47,280
a little trick question because the

768
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:49,889
security guard actually has a badge but

769
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,940
you still ask for everybody it's like

770
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,820
that's who you ask

771
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:56,040
it's like you make sure from the CEO to

772
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,960
the guy in the mailroom they should all

773
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,600
have identification and they should all

774
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,520
be asked for it it's like I remember I

775
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,350
did a security awareness training class

776
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:08,250
for all new hires at this one online

777
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:11,370
Bank and a week after one of the classes

778
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,970
the owner not just well I think he was a

779
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,770
CEO too

780
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:16,530
he may not bother he was the only on

781
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:17,850
that in place right he was trying to get

782
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,800
into the second floor where our

783
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:23,760
datacenter was and he didn't have his

784
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:26,790
badge an employee literally only there

785
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:29,129
for about a week and a half saw him

786
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:30,540
coming and he was like sir you can't

787
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:32,220
come in here it's like you don't have

788
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,830
your badge I need to escort you to the

789
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:38,220
to the front office it's like do you

790
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:40,290
know what that owner did is that people

791
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,060
take fire it's like that owner went like

792
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:43,440
that's a very good response it's like

793
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,970
let's go up there and let's make sure

794
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,070
that we take care of this it's like goes

795
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:49,170
up to the front desk got a visitor's

796
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:51,090
badge it's like until he could get his

797
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:53,580
other badge and then left and got that

798
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:56,879
guy's name to us so we could properly

799
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:59,159
thank him for a job well done how many

800
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,520
other people tried to get an exception

801
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:05,340
to that rule how many other people in

802
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:08,910
that company thought it was okay not to

803
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:10,949
have their badge zero because the owner

804
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:14,070
lived up to the policy and the

805
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:15,480
procedures and took them seriously so

806
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:18,000
the guy who owns a company is going to

807
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:23,240
live by those rules by Godley everybody

808
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,740
else's right that's the way it works so

809
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:29,460
what do your employees think a password

810
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:33,300
manager is please tell me because I'm

811
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:35,610
literally legit curious what point in

812
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:38,430
history it's like it had to be like in

813
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:42,330
the 60s or 70s that someone looked at

814
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:44,790
their keyboard and when hmm that's a

815
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:46,500
good place to put a password I don't

816
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:48,300
think no one's ever going to look under

817
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,800
there I'll just put my little toast

818
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,710
another of the keyboard will be fine

819
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,300
it's like I mean how many people have

820
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:56,160
done that how many people have looked

821
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,260
under a keyboard and found a password

822
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,850
and then course

823
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,460
this is how many people voted under a

824
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:06,889
keyboard and found a password yes

825
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:09,590
that's why we drink right it's like

826
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:12,840
that's one of the educators I'm sure

827
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:16,590
it's like it's like so what we need to

828
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:18,209
do is like so I've got a great this Cup

829
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:20,820
there's no blinky lights involved in

830
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:24,559
this it's great for security awareness

831
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:28,439
and your team can do it right now

832
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:31,940
set up a schedule for for it so you

833
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:34,860
cover every single company branch

834
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:37,290
outpost whatever off this and floor

835
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:38,729
throughout the year it's like no matter

836
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:42,000
how long it takes it's like how many's

837
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:43,950
but just pick one floor a day or a week

838
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,919
or a quarter whichever is easier for you

839
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:49,500
to do it's like and have your security

840
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:52,860
team go through that floor and look

841
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:55,799
under every single keyboard you're going

842
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,469
to be depressed at first a lot okay

843
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:59,879
you're gonna be depressed a lot at first

844
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:04,040
it's like but do you know what you've

845
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:06,720
done you showed them that you're real

846
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,790
you showed them that someone is looking

847
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,679
someone is it trying to make sure that

848
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,779
the policies are in forth and you work

849
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:14,250
even if you don't find anything you're

850
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,500
gonna find something okay

851
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,609
you're still making a valid effort to

852
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,929
show people like hey I'm with

853
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:20,340
information security and you look under

854
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:21,929
your keyboard we're doing a password

855
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,580
sweep for security okay thank you very

856
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:26,970
much sorry to interrupt it's like and

857
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:29,460
you go through that the whole way that

858
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:31,408
right there is an invaluable security

859
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:33,629
awareness engagement for your users and

860
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:35,760
that didn't cost you a dime except for a

861
00:34:33,629 --> 00:34:38,009
little bit of time it's like I'm a poet

862
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,659
I know it don't worry it's like so

863
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:43,190
that's what you need to do start

864
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:45,270
creating that kind of rigorous

865
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,580
inspection and let people know that

866
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:50,280
those passwords are serious go and do a

867
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:52,230
tutorials how many of your users know

868
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:57,810
that the spacebar is a valid network

869
00:34:52,230 --> 00:35:01,410
login character the spacebar that is the

870
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:04,770
best key on the keyboard because I don't

871
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:10,618
write passwords anymore passwords are so

872
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:11,759
2010 right I do pass phrases I figured

873
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:13,200
write the effing Ilia

874
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,970
now you know it's like I got the space

875
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,649
character I guess they are it's like it

876
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:19,200
was the best of times it was the worst a

877
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:21,030
time exclamation point time I've got a 1

878
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,009
instead of an eye and a 3 instead of an

879
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:25,410
e it's like lit that's elite hacker

880
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:30,390
speak right there poetry it's like you

881
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:32,190
know it's also uncrackable win win show

882
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:35,100
them that they can use the space bar

883
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:37,530
show them what a good passphrase looks

884
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,960
like show them how they can use their

885
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:42,660
song lyrics or their favorite movie

886
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,910
quotes as a passphrase on their

887
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:49,430
different systems and servers and then

888
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:52,560
on a post-it note they just write Gmail

889
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:54,149
Terminator 3 as long as it's not I'll be

890
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,529
back don't use Arnold Schwarzenegger

891
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:57,180
quotes cuz they're always like to the

892
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:59,490
chopper I'll be back they're very short

893
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:01,230
okay it's like it's like so so get them

894
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,759
to like some some better quotes from

895
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,620
different movies it's like you know a

896
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:08,070
little bit longer quotes a little better

897
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:10,680
senior song lyrics okay let's face it if

898
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:12,000
it's like you know Gmail Rick Astley we

899
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,710
know it's never gonna give you up it's

900
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,030
like so it's like tell them to make a

901
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:18,180
little bit more obscure yes I just

902
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:19,710
record show me con so that's one of the

903
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,960
key things that you have to do it's like

904
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:24,870
educate your users on how to be better

905
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,820
at it and and and give them that and

906
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:28,290
empower them with that education so

907
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,450
they're like okay I'll start using pass

908
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:32,580
phrases because what happens when you

909
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:35,069
make them use a special character and a

910
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:36,810
lowercase character and and a number and

911
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:38,970
it's like an you know what they write

912
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:41,670
really complex really you know eight

913
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:44,189
character twelve character passwords

914
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:45,300
that they have no way of remembering so

915
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,520
they put it down the post-it note and

916
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:51,930
put it into your keyboard it's a vicious

917
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:54,210
cycle people we need to break it so show

918
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:57,200
them how to do passphrases show them how

919
00:36:54,210 --> 00:37:00,030
that helps and makes it more effective

920
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,950
now another thing is what does your

921
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:05,130
social media profile really say about

922
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:08,299
you it's like there's been a big debate

923
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:11,280
on the the the Twitterverse lately about

924
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:14,370
people using employee social media

925
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,540
profiles against them it's like my whole

926
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:18,779
take on that

927
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:20,279
huh it's like I'm not supposed to use

928
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,780
one of the biggest gold mines in the

929
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,440
history because people might think I'm a

930
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:27,030
bad person I'm trying to rob you we've

931
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,860
established the fact that I'm a bad

932
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:34,590
person way long ago okay

933
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:37,470
bad people are looking at social media

934
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:39,600
profile I'm not going to go in and

935
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:41,250
create an account and make a

936
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,170
relationship with the person and tell

937
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,790
them that I want to marry them and go on

938
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:46,980
for six months until we start playing

939
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:48,630
the wedding and they go surprise it was

940
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,700
a fish I just wanted your accounting

941
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,720
information sorry you just booked that

942
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,910
thing to Aruba

943
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:57,209
we're not going okay that's a little

944
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:59,420
extreme okay but I am going to use my

945
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:03,000
fake accounts to go in and peruse

946
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:04,350
Facebook in LinkedIn and Twitter and I

947
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,600
am going to use that information to

948
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:09,150
gather as much information as your

949
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:13,410
employees are willfully putting out

950
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:14,970
there to the public to the public not to

951
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:17,069
like friends I'm not accepting your

952
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:19,259
friend requests it's like I did get a

953
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:21,390
guy on LinkedIn to endorse me I was a 23

954
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,940
year old female redhead who just had

955
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:25,440
finished going getting my CPA and I was

956
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,210
an accountant and so it was really

957
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,320
wonderful it's like an he endorsed me

958
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:32,910
for my tax information and my accounting

959
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,530
experience they gave me a lot of good

960
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,660
endorsements it's like and I got a lot

961
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:39,840
of good compromise so it's a win-win

962
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:41,790
situation for everybody but I don't

963
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:44,100
usually go and do the involvement I'm

964
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:47,130
using those to gather information there

965
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:48,060
was one particular teller or I don't

966
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,680
know if they were even a teller it's

967
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:53,700
like there was someone in a bank branch

968
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,359
and they literally had on a public

969
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,819
profile

970
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,620
I was not friends with him and trust me

971
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:02,100
after that talk I will never be friends

972
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:03,660
with him it's like I said I could show I

973
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,410
had a screenshot of showing the ad

974
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:07,740
friend button

975
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:11,549
I was not their friend so publicly to

976
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:15,660
the world they had their phone number

977
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:19,100
and their home address available on

978
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:22,200
their about page on Facebook profile

979
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:25,130
this is a time in America where people

980
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,299
are still being kidnapped held overnight

981
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:30,180
to open up the bank that

982
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,940
morning to be robbed and the next slide

983
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:35,609
that I showed was a picture of their

984
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,420
house I'm not creepy okay I didn't

985
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,920
actually go to their house take a

986
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:41,030
picture okay it was Google Streetview

987
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:46,860
it's like but I showed that picture and

988
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:49,050
people were upset mad disappointed in me

989
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:50,820
I mean I get that a lot so it was okay

990
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:53,700
but it's like but still it was very

991
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:56,520
upsetting and I'm like you don't think

992
00:39:53,700 --> 00:40:00,029
bad guys are doing this this is what bad

993
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:01,980
guys do they do bad guy things it's like

994
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:04,800
the only difference between me doing

995
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:08,400
this and all the other people that are

996
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,200
doing this right now is with me you get

997
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,890
a report

998
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:15,649
you're being pen tested at this moment

999
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:18,660
you're just not getting the report

1000
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:20,310
that's what you pay for when you're

1001
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,750
getting a pen test you're not paying for

1002
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:24,120
the actual attack and all the other

1003
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:25,980
stuff you're you're getting paid for

1004
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:28,500
that report at the end of the time that

1005
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,880
tells you how to fix the issues because

1006
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,590
there's like five other people in

1007
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,210
Paraguay testing the same exact thing

1008
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,920
and it's like no offense to any

1009
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:37,200
Paraguayans but it's like I just like

1010
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:40,590
saying Paraguay so it's like so that's

1011
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,359
one of the issues that you have is that

1012
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:44,700
you've got to watch out and you got to

1013
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:47,900
make sure your employees know by being

1014
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:50,939
an employee they couldn't be in a target

1015
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,860
they have to be suspicious of who's

1016
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:55,320
trying to friend them it's like who's

1017
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:57,060
trying to look at their profile who's

1018
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,190
trying to connect to them on LinkedIn if

1019
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:02,820
they ask them questions or they send

1020
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:05,400
them unusual quizzes I literally saw

1021
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:09,570
this one quiz the top 25 things about

1022
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:11,400
you and I'm like that's interesting it's

1023
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:15,540
like oh let me look at these questions

1024
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:18,000
oh these are the top 25 password reset

1025
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:20,210
questions for email servers and banks

1026
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,920
it's like what a co-inky-dink

1027
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:24,900
right it's like all those things like

1028
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,310
you know what Game of Thrones character

1029
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,260
you are it's like who cares about that

1030
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:29,310
now right but it's like it's like what

1031
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,250
Marvel here

1032
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:35,850
it's like what's this what it all those

1033
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:37,320
things are mining your information it's

1034
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:38,520
like you don't know where it's going

1035
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,320
okay

1036
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,080
everybody wants to be Tyrion Lannister

1037
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:45,660
everybody's iron man it's like it's just

1038
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:49,049
it's what it is so it's like so stop

1039
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:51,779
trying to answer those now another thing

1040
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:53,880
is one that sorry I hate picking on

1041
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,260
these people a little this thing is one

1042
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,910
of the leading causes of compromise but

1043
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:00,270
did your employees really take it

1044
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:02,609
seriously that's another thing that was

1045
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:04,470
just recently on Twitter it's like I'm

1046
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:05,850
on Twitter way too much obviously it's

1047
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:08,580
like and but that's one of the problems

1048
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:10,049
is that one company was trying to sue

1049
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,299
their employee for doing a phishing

1050
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:15,750
attack and I'm like for the first time

1051
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:17,940
no that's not cool it's like but I'm one

1052
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:20,730
of those guys if your employee keeps

1053
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:23,550
clicking on malicious links after you've

1054
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:25,770
reacted them after you told them what

1055
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:28,020
the threats were and they still doing

1056
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:31,170
that then why aren't you firing that

1057
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:33,750
employee for doing it if you have a

1058
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:37,770
delivery driver that keeps wrecking your

1059
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:40,860
van do you keep that delivery driver on

1060
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:43,890
the payroll and that's just like the

1061
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:46,700
50,000 dollar vehicle you've got

1062
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:49,140
employees cost you 300 million dollars

1063
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:52,410
maybe you want to look into some you

1064
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:54,990
know corrective measures so in this

1065
00:42:52,410 --> 00:43:00,180
attack target over 300 million dollars

1066
00:42:54,990 --> 00:43:02,970
how did that start phishing email I mean

1067
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:04,589
I mean trust me the CEO of the HVAC

1068
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:10,319
company was quick to say we were a

1069
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:14,040
victim of apt apt goddess what is apt

1070
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:15,180
stand for no that's what they tell the

1071
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:18,300
board and that's what they tell their

1072
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:21,480
shareholders apt stands for adequate

1073
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:25,050
fishing technique that's what apt stands

1074
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:27,300
for they tell the other stuff to their

1075
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:28,530
board members okay because they want to

1076
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:32,520
get out of it and make it not their

1077
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:34,680
fault but nine times out of ten that's

1078
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:37,530
what Starr did was a phishing and if

1079
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,390
that's what started if you know that

1080
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:42,780
there is a problem in your production

1081
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:46,049
line that one of your robot

1082
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:48,930
that is assembly your car is every once

1083
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:51,420
in a while not bolting down properly one

1084
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:53,850
of the parts in the engine so every

1085
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:57,570
third car that you put out there blows

1086
00:43:53,850 --> 00:44:00,000
up and kills your drivers would you fix

1087
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:02,540
that I mean either your general motors

1088
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,140
in the 70s but would you fix that now

1089
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:09,270
okay stop too soon it's like it's like

1090
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,740
my bad they literally waited for 13

1091
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:13,890
people to die but okay whatever it's

1092
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:17,220
like I'm the bad guy it's like so you

1093
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:20,009
would try to fix that we know that

1094
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:22,290
fishing is an attack vector that is

1095
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:24,270
being used regularly we know that your

1096
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:26,100
employees are being targeted if your

1097
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:29,220
employees don't consider it part of

1098
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:32,009
their job to be cautious with opening

1099
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:35,370
emails then you're failing your client

1100
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:37,350
your users and your executives you're

1101
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:39,810
failing them not them failing the

1102
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:42,960
company we keep trying to get technology

1103
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:44,940
to protect the users against themselves

1104
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:48,960
instead of getting our users properly

1105
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:51,120
trained to protect the technology that's

1106
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,520
what happens they're your best asset

1107
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,109
stop treating them like a liability and

1108
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,370
start treating them like you're part of

1109
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:58,080
the team and let them be aware that

1110
00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:00,270
they're part of the team because that's

1111
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:03,840
what they've never not been part of your

1112
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:05,850
team so we need to get that going we

1113
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,830
need to get that I mean and it's a

1114
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:09,420
broken record and it's like a horse I'm

1115
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:12,270
gonna keep on kicking and a windmill I'm

1116
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,890
gonna keep tilting at sue me not really

1117
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:17,610
I don't have any lawyers I'm very bad at

1118
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:19,350
business okay so what metrics do you

1119
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:21,600
have that helps to justify your budget

1120
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:24,690
and your actions I've had three

1121
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:27,230
conversations on two continents just in

1122
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:29,730
the last two weeks about this subject

1123
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:31,470
it's like about budget how do I get

1124
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:35,160
upper management to buy into this

1125
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:37,410
process and I'm like how are you showing

1126
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,670
what you do it's like that well that

1127
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:40,230
gets there it's a constant well of

1128
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:43,500
course they consider your call center

1129
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:44,760
the better you do the less Stacy it's

1130
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,900
like I love going at the end of the year

1131
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,480
stuff you know you go to your boss like

1132
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,920
hey have you noticed nothing really bad

1133
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,730
happened to our network we didn't get

1134
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,560
briefed nothing will if you

1135
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:55,900
two million dollars it's like I'll make

1136
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:58,630
sure nothing happens next year it's like

1137
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:01,090
it's like a mafia you know mafiosos

1138
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:03,880
Italy it's got really lights businesses

1139
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:04,930
hate to have something happen to it you

1140
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,820
know give me a couple of hundred

1141
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:08,319
thousand more you can make sure that it

1142
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,850
doesn't happen I'm just saying you know

1143
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,650
it's like that would be bad

1144
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:15,609
it's like and I'm very bad at Italian

1145
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:19,270
mafiosos but still that's a bad thing so

1146
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:22,660
give them numbers how many fire do you

1147
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:25,090
log the hits on your firewall they're

1148
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:26,618
coming in the answer is yes it's like an

1149
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:28,060
what do you do with them you discard

1150
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:29,380
them every 30 months like every every

1151
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,820
other company does in the world right

1152
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:34,330
because he wants to read through them

1153
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:36,400
but the record how many hits come in put

1154
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:36,910
that moat in an excel sheet and you got

1155
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,420
a number

1156
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:41,830
you got a metric it's like but Jason

1157
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,570
that doesn't make sense who character

1158
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:46,450
not really going to look at they want to

1159
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:48,640
see numbers give them numbers how many

1160
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:49,960
ideas that works you get coming through

1161
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,940
the day well we haven't probably turned

1162
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:54,190
your ID yes I know you haven't properly

1163
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:57,490
to the dry Diaz everybody here knows you

1164
00:46:54,190 --> 00:47:01,300
haven't properly tuned your IDs that's

1165
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:04,419
not a secret but it's numbers that you

1166
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:06,160
can use how many spam emails get through

1167
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,750
your email gateway will Jason that's our

1168
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:12,609
business we don't care

1169
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:14,710
those are numbers use them get those

1170
00:47:12,609 --> 00:47:15,279
metrics how many machines do you have in

1171
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:16,960
your network

1172
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,750
we don't really know you better ethic

1173
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,280
find out soon okay because that's just

1174
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:22,480
bad that's besides the point that's not

1175
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,040
even part of this talk I'm going on a

1176
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,750
rant you need to find out how many

1177
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,609
machines are in your network okay

1178
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:29,650
because if the guy in Paraguay knows how

1179
00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:31,210
many machines you have and you don't you

1180
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:33,970
have one extra machine you really need

1181
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:37,000
to be worried about okay that's all I'm

1182
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:39,189
saying no how many machines are on your

1183
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,380
network because sometimes they have the

1184
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,240
habit of increasing by one and you're

1185
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:45,530
going to have a very bad

1186
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,879
day so track how many machines you have

1187
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:50,910
track how many of them are patched

1188
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:53,130
properly and put that in a report and

1189
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:57,960
that report when you first get it is

1190
00:47:53,130 --> 00:48:00,210
going to suck really bad because now

1191
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:03,320
there's gonna be you know attached you

1192
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:06,030
know actual responsibility we hate that

1193
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:07,980
okay but then things start getting

1194
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:09,960
better and you get to start showing

1195
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:12,450
improvement and then at the end of the

1196
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,460
year you go to the executive and you say

1197
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:15,509
hey you see how our metrics improved and

1198
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,680
we're trying to get better on this and

1199
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:17,760
we're on task when we're trying to

1200
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,740
increase that we're going to need a

1201
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,760
patch management solution and we're

1202
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,169
going to need an asset management

1203
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,430
tracker and we're gonna need these other

1204
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:24,690
things to help make sure that we're

1205
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:26,310
running smoothly we're actually gonna be

1206
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:27,720
able to do this increase it's like can

1207
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:28,920
we get a budget for that and they're

1208
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,819
gonna look at the numbers and their act

1209
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,440
like they're gonna read them it's a new

1210
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:34,110
pie chart so that you're good it's like

1211
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,550
okay yeah we can do that it's like we

1212
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:38,100
need to get that done that sounds like a

1213
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:41,580
good idea it's like yeah so that's how

1214
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:43,610
you do that so and one of the last

1215
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:46,710
things it's like I'm gonna say is

1216
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:47,609
educate and power users can you ever

1217
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:52,170
have enough for that

1218
00:48:47,609 --> 00:48:54,950
the answer is no always make sure your

1219
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:58,800
employees feel empowered to say

1220
00:48:54,950 --> 00:49:02,009
something's wrong I don't know who that

1221
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,230
person is I need to report them it's

1222
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:06,450
like I don't know where this email came

1223
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:11,570
from it looks suspicious I need to

1224
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:16,140
report it December 7th 1941 Pearl Harbor

1225
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:19,020
that morning a person manning the radar

1226
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:22,890
station one of the first radar stations

1227
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:26,340
in the world and this was at a time when

1228
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:28,379
the world was at war and this was a Navy

1229
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:31,619
base or an Arras it was an Air Force

1230
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:32,760
Base or Navy base Navy okay so I'm

1231
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:33,000
picking on the Navy this time so there

1232
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,000
we go

1233
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,000
so it's like so on a Navy base Pearl

1234
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,390
Harbor it's like the person manning the

1235
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,400
radar station sees planes coming from an

1236
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:48,839
abnormal vector from an unusual

1237
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:50,730
direction and they do their job they

1238
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,090
report it to their next thing next in

1239
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:52,140
command

1240
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:53,640
they've got sir it's like we've got

1241
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:56,460
planes coming in from the unusual

1242
00:49:53,640 --> 00:50:00,569
what do we do do you know what that

1243
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:02,190
person said person looked at it knowing

1244
00:50:00,569 --> 00:50:03,359
that we the world was at war knowing

1245
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:05,609
that they were a military installation

1246
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:08,339
seeing a whole bunch of planes coming in

1247
00:50:05,609 --> 00:50:10,049
and their immediate reaction was that's

1248
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:14,369
probably our training planes you just

1249
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:16,349
disregard spoiler alert it was not the

1250
00:50:14,369 --> 00:50:17,910
training planes and it's like

1251
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:19,079
everybody's like Jason thanks for

1252
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:20,910
bringing down the whole room now but

1253
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:24,390
it's like a debbie downer it's a we're

1254
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:25,890
doing so well the wolf is like war so no

1255
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:29,848
but that's one of the things it's like

1256
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:32,788
because they did not human actions are

1257
00:50:29,849 --> 00:50:34,890
always going to be this seems bad I

1258
00:50:32,789 --> 00:50:38,309
don't want it to be that give me another

1259
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:40,259
alternative to it and I'll buy it you

1260
00:50:38,309 --> 00:50:41,369
had to get your employees off that you

1261
00:50:40,259 --> 00:50:44,309
have to get your employees to be

1262
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:45,390
suspicious not to be paranoid not to

1263
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:49,289
every time they get an email like this

1264
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:51,480
is trap what's going home you know it's

1265
00:50:49,289 --> 00:50:53,089
like no I don't want them tackling the

1266
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,989
FedEx guy okay

1267
00:50:53,089 --> 00:50:56,788
it's like because sometimes that might

1268
00:50:54,989 --> 00:50:59,940
be me okay and I'm fragile i bruise

1269
00:50:56,789 --> 00:51:03,089
easily okay but they at least need to

1270
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:05,759
report they at least need to report

1271
00:51:03,089 --> 00:51:08,130
those suspicious activities they need to

1272
00:51:05,759 --> 00:51:10,920
have a chain of command if you're if you

1273
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:13,019
don't have an extension or an email

1274
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:16,769
address that every single one of your

1275
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:19,979
employees know to report you don't have

1276
00:51:16,769 --> 00:51:22,379
a security program how are they going to

1277
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:24,509
report that I'd literally remember one

1278
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:26,190
time I'm in Amman Jordan and I'm robbing

1279
00:51:24,509 --> 00:51:27,480
this Bank and the managers frantically

1280
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:30,119
telling me I told this story many times

1281
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,529
I know but it's still pertinent I was

1282
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:32,819
plugging in a USB Drive and she's

1283
00:51:31,529 --> 00:51:34,440
telling me it's like sorry you can't

1284
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:36,569
plug that in and I'm like you're right I

1285
