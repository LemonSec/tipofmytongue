so talking about the real Kevin Johnson

32
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:39,080
who spoke yesterday I'm sitting at my

33
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,899
booth and a gentleman walks up to me and

34
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,990
he said he was being helpful right he's

35
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:51,920
like don't you speak in five minutes and

36
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:55,310
I had a moment of panic like oh do

37
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,020
i luckily

38
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,640
Larry who is sitting at the booth with

39
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,490
me he's one of my guys he's like no

40
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,050
Kevin you don't that's the other Kevin

41
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,619
Johnson is like but I'm the other Kevin

42
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:07,130
Johnson

43
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:09,380
so I'm Kevin I've been Kevin for 46

44
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:12,680
years I've been Kevin Johnson for 18

45
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,720
less than that you do the math I'm lazy

46
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,630
so we're going to talk today about

47
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,150
something that is near and dear to my

48
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:23,900
heart this is something that matters a

49
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:28,160
lot to me and I hope that you enjoy the

50
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:32,030
ride but if you don't then you just are

51
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:36,709
wrong so we're gonna talk about how we

52
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:38,270
can fix the and I'm gonna use a phrase

53
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:39,380
now that you're all gonna laugh at

54
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,080
because it sounds like a marketing

55
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,480
phrase but the skills gap that we keep

56
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,690
hearing about right and while I don't

57
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,390
believe that most of the information we

58
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,340
have about the skills gap is true I

59
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,890
believe most of it is marketing crap

60
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:58,970
from companies that want to sell more

61
00:02:54,890 --> 00:03:02,059
training I do believe that we have some

62
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,800
problems with filling positions we have

63
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,500
some problems with filling positions

64
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:11,450
with people who are not only qualified

65
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:13,040
but are actually good people I and one

66
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:17,000
of the reasons for this in my opinion is

67
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:23,390
that it's so important is the job that

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,010
we do is critical for the future and I

69
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,980
don't mean that to blow smoke up your

70
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:30,890
rear I mean that because it's it's true

71
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,570
I have two daughters and you'll hear

72
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,609
about my kids if you haven't already I

73
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,480
love my daughters and currently they

74
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,130
still like me

75
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,910
my understanding is as they get older

76
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,400
that will

77
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:43,040
and then I hope that it then changes

78
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,720
back is my understanding but I love my

79
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,820
two daughters are awesome my wife is

80
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,050
amazing and having kids I just got lucky

81
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:55,850
they're beautiful kids so they can't be

82
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:57,850
mine Brenna when she was nine and I've

83
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:00,109
talked about this on this stage before

84
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:03,019
Brenna when she was nine had her

85
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,850
identity stolen she was treated at the

86
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,580
local Wolfson's Children's Hospital

87
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:11,420
which was wonderful they dealt with us

88
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,680
the family and her amazingly and then

89
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,829
about three months after she was in the

90
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,440
hospital they were breached and they

91
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:22,250
lost the medical data and information

92
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,980
about all of their patients and I part

93
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,360
of me is furious I will acknowledge the

94
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,040
fact that if I ever find the person who

95
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,230
breached Wolfson's and stole my

96
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:35,240
daughter's data I will probably forget

97
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:38,030
the ethical part of my title and so but

98
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,260
I got to have a conversation with my

99
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,640
nine-year-old daughter about the fact

100
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,539
that for the rest of her life she was

101
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,729
gonna have to deal with identity theft

102
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,910
that you can google search her social

103
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:50,870
security number today right and that's a

104
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:54,050
problem and I and I feel like one of the

105
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:58,250
main reasons we have that problem is is

106
00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:01,180
that too many organizations either don't

107
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:05,510
understand why security is important and

108
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:09,590
or they can't find people who are

109
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:11,120
willing to fix the problems we see too

110
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,310
many talks I was having a conversation

111
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,840
with a gentleman earlier we see too many

112
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:18,340
talks about people who stand up here and

113
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:21,020
talk about I hacked this and I'm awesome

114
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,599
but they don't really talk about this is

115
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,039
how we fix it right and this is what we

116
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,130
do to make it better

117
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:32,810
okay we also see way too much

118
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:35,390
information about cool hacks yet as

119
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,850
somebody else said to me this morning

120
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:40,669
MSO eight oh six seven is still in the

121
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:43,040
wild and for the people who don't know

122
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:47,000
vo eight is the year the patch was

123
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:50,900
released right that patch is almost

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,510
older than my kids that's a problem

125
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,070
and we still see it and we can all sit

126
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:58,280
here and clap ourselves on the back for

127
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:00,860
being cool hack sores or we can actually

128
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,650
go fix stuff and that's what I want us

129
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,750
to do I want us to fix it and I talked

130
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,429
about this and I used the title the

131
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,010
great explainer because of Richard

132
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:13,250
Fineman and I never met Richard Fineman

133
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:15,770
I wish I had he was a physicist way

134
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,020
smarter than I am I'm not that smart I'm

135
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:24,740
an idiot I barely made it out of high

136
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:27,830
school I fake it right I I do what I

137
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:31,270
need to do to make it work but Richard

138
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:34,159
Fineman if you ever listened to his

139
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:36,560
presentations his classes if you ever

140
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,430
listen to interviews with him one of the

141
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:45,050
main things he talks about is how

142
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:49,790
critical it is for us to share the

143
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:53,410
knowledge we have that we have to make

144
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:58,700
other people better because they know us

145
00:06:53,410 --> 00:07:01,130
we have to raise the water line for

146
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:05,150
everybody so that we float the boats

147
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:09,409
higher right that's our job that's our

148
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:12,830
main being when I die which I hope is a

149
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:15,670
long long time away from now but I will

150
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:19,760
say every birthday gets closer right

151
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:21,920
when I die I hope that what people say

152
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:25,130
about me other than the fact I'm fat and

153
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:28,520
lazy and funny-looking is that people

154
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:32,240
learned from me even if all they learned

155
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,549
is what not to do right that's my goal

156
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,380
I am also a greedy capitalist my goals

157
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:40,250
be protested by the Occupy movement but

158
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:42,830
that's a different goal pup tents in my

159
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,000
cul-de-sac or something before we really

160
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,090
get started let me tell you a little bit

161
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,100
about myself I'm given like I said I'm a

162
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,929
nerd I am such a nerd I've said this

163
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,880
before but I'm such a nerd that the

164
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:56,060
bully who used to take my lunch money

165
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,740
still does but he makes a damn good

166
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:05,099
Subway sandwich

167
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:07,500
I am the CEO or head nerd of secure

168
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:09,930
ideas we are a consulting firm right

169
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,849
we're pen testers what does that mean

170
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,819
and why does it impact you guys

171
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:16,710
it means we're hackers the majority of

172
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:18,030
what we do for a living and this is

173
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,400
important because of the way I look at

174
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:24,270
things is break into companies who gave

175
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,840
us permission steal oh sorry steal

176
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:31,258
stuff by the way pg-13 okay we go with

177
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,029
that we steal stuff and then we show

178
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:34,289
them how we did it so they can fix the

179
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:36,630
problems and the reason I mention this

180
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,338
is because it affects my perspective

181
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,630
it's way I talk about things right some

182
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,659

220
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,710
I've ever done I pointed out to her

221
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,219
lychee maybe when I was 26

222
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:23,010
she doesn't know but I am a member of

223
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,650

224
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:27,569
costuming group twelve thousand members

225
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,510
or sixteen thousand members strong

226
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:32,850
worldwide we build screen accurate Star

227
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:35,580
Wars costumes and then we wear them to

228
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,990
raise money for charity right I want to

229
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,490
say last year we raised something like

230
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:43,770
14 million dollars worldwide right so I

231
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,060
thank you but that wasn't me I just want

232
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,920
to be very clear that wasn't me I'm just

233
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:50,010
one of the nerds in a Darth Vader

234
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,930
costume right that's and I get to do

235
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,240
cool things like go to hospitals and

236
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,099
cheer up kids and and stuff like that so

237
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,380
like for example the picture the Veda

238
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,090
there is me that was an event where they

239
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,480
brought in two or three hundred blind

240
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:05,130
kids and we let them feel the costumes

241
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,910
so they knew what the characters look

242
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:10,590
like I'm crying in that helmet right

243
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,959
that's what I get to do I'm building a

244
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:15,360
Jew baka right now I've been building

245
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:19,140
Chewbacca for five years and I'm about a

246
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,250
month from being done I am so excited I

247
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:26,160
will admit that there is wookie hair

248
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:27,870
everywhere in my house I when I got here

249
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,510
two nights ago not last night night

250
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:33,150
before I pulled my clothes out of the

251
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:35,370
suitcase and wookie hair came out with

252
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:38,670
it so and for the people who don't know

253
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:42,300
Whoopie hair is just weave hair I own 26

254
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:44,520
pounds of weave at my house which I

255
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,910
believe is more weave hair than anybody

256
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,960
should own so the best part is once I

257
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,810
finished costume I have to go to a

258
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:56,040
hairstylist and wear it and have them

259
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:59,779
me I just want to walk in to Supercuts

260
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:03,300
that way really I'm here for a haircut

261
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:05,480
good okay so one last thing about me I

262
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,689
have a sense of humor

263
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:11,999
please note you might have misheard me I

264
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:14,248
did not say I have a good sense of humor

265
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:15,839
I said I have a sense of humor I my

266
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:18,149
favorite joke which was my favorite joke

267
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,480
last year it's still my favorite joke do

268
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:25,680
you know why Walmart wasn't hacked

269
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:28,170
they're not a target exactly I got to

270
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,180
introduce like the C ISO of Walmart at

271
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:34,469
an event and he wouldn't shake my hand

272
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:36,209
after I told that joke I said you

273
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,499
weren't hat I thought you had a good

274
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:42,569
side of the joke

275
00:12:37,499 --> 00:12:45,050
so the last thing I want to point out

276
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:48,719
and this is my sales pitch for the day

277
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:50,399
okay time to and after I give you my

278
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,550
sales pitch you'll recognize I'm a sucky

279
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,949
salesperson one if you are a veteran

280
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:58,620
active duty military or first responder

281
00:12:55,949 --> 00:13:02,250
almost all of our training is free for

282
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:05,129
you all you have to do is ask we'll give

283
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:08,509
you a coupon code no no no that's not

284
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:11,970
don't applaud me I'm not the veteran I

285
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:13,920
have bad lungs I do say veteran though

286
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,079
because this veterinarian wrote me I

287
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,878
used to say vets if you're a vet and

288
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,290
this guy wrote me and I'll be honest

289
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:21,149
have you been polite about it I would

290
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,319
have given him the coupon code but he

291
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:23,309
wrote rude he's like well you probably

292
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:28,229
won't give it to me because I'm a

293
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:31,949
veterinarian Mike you're right no that's

294
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:35,429
the first one second sales pitch if you

295
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:38,639
are a non-profit charity our services

296
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:40,259
are free please note I did not say our

297
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,300
services are free for six months I did

298
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:44,850
not say some of our services are free

299
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,529
our services are free for as long as we

300
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:49,079
offer the service you have to be an

301
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:51,559
approved nonprofit charity to be clear

302
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:55,900
what I mean by approved is I approve you

303
00:13:51,559 --> 00:14:02,050
it's a pretty simple rule don't be a

304
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:04,600
dick charity Westboro Baptist Church the

305
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:06,819
people who protest military funerals

306
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:15,180
they are a federally recognized

307
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:15,180
nonprofit charity right

308
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:19,960
that's my sales pitch for the day we're

309
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,280
talking about the problems we're going

310
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,050
to talk about the shoulders of giants

311
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,980
and then how do we move forward

312
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:29,370
the first problem we have as an industry

313
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:32,850
we have a skills gap I know I know

314
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:37,450
marketing but it's true

315
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:40,480
we have trouble finding people who know

316
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:44,470
about security we have trouble finding

317
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:47,230
people who know how to fix the problem I

318
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:49,540
want to point out that I have quoted two

319
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:54,640
different articles here from the same

320
00:14:49,540 --> 00:15:01,030
source that are five years apart I think

321
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:02,920
my only before I suck at math we've had

322
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:05,650
the skills gap for as long as I remember

323
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:09,010
Allen Power has been ranting about it at

324
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:11,949
Congress and now if I was a good guy I

325
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:16,390
like him but he's been beating the same

326
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:19,450
drum forever we suck at finding people

327
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:21,640
who know stuff and the other part of

328
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:24,880
this slide in my opinion tells you why

329
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:27,970
we suck at finding people who know this

330
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:31,450
stuff because what I did is I went out

331
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:33,670
to a number of training sources last

332
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:35,530
night because I wanted to get the most

333
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:41,410
up-to-date information I also wrote my

334
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:44,319
presentation last night but I wanted to

335
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:49,319
get the most updated information to take

336
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:52,750
a six day class and certification is

337
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:57,370
seven thousand three hundred and seventy

338
00:15:52,750 --> 00:16:01,630
nine dollars who the hell can afford

339
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:05,800
that I can't and I run a successful

340
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:08,350
security consulting firm there's no way

341
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,709
and that's not just one source I want to

342
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:14,510
be very clear

343
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:16,900
right all of the major training sources

344
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:20,810
for information security training is

345
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:25,850
multiples of thousands of dollars to get

346
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:28,790
in the door we're talking three five and

347
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:32,450
six day courses posting four five six

348
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:41,120
seven thousand dollars oh and you got a

349
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:44,240
travel there right I can't do that I get

350
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,910
calls daily emails daily from people I

351
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,870
want to learn what you do no you don't

352
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:53,380
okay you do it's awesome I love what I

353
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:56,510
do I really do love what I do

354
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:58,130
right how many other people get to say

355
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:01,990
so I was sitting at work today and I

356
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:07,910
stole million dollars from a company

357
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:11,599
it's fun right but how do we learn this

358
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:13,209
stuff if every single place we go all I

359
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,219
want to do is take money from us and

360
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:18,500
lots of money I've been raining about

361
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,360
this for years I refer to it my hashtag

362
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,209
because I found out some millennial told

363
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:26,599
me I needed to have a hashtag so I

364
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:28,339
created one affordable training because

365
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,419
the reality is training has to be

366
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:32,720
affordable because if it's not

367
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:34,130
affordable we can't do it and I'm not

368
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,810
getting political here right we're not

369
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,710
gonna talk about free college and all

370
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,810
that kind and I'm not saying free

371
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,010
college is a bad idea I didn't go to

372
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:44,600
college I don't know if college is a

373
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:49,250
good idea right but if we can't afford

374
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:53,149
to learn it if we can't go to a good

375
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:54,050
place where we can trust the information

376
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:57,080
because that's the thing I'm going to

377
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:58,460
talk about in a second the next slide is

378
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,629
the fact that so many of the source of

379
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:04,220
information we have that aren't $7,000

380
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:07,490
are wrong

381
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:10,160
I saw this article being shared I shot

382
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:11,780
skipping ahead but I saw this article

383
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,870
being shared on Twitter by lots of

384
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:19,760
people I respect and it was a blog post

385
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:22,090
about md5 hashes and I went to the blog

386
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,539
post and the entire description

387
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:28,789
conversation was about

388
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:31,759
how to decrypt md5 hashes laughing is

389
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:34,460
the right reaction to that because you

390
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:37,429
can't decrypt md5 hashes it's why

391
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:43,129
they're called one-way hashes it's in

392
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:44,989
the damn name and I read the article and

393
00:18:43,129 --> 00:18:46,158
I want to be clear I want to be good I

394
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:47,359
didn't put the article up on a slide

395
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:50,359
because I want to embarrass the person

396
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:53,629
who wrote it because I look I don't I'm

397
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:57,668
a mean guy I am import records and not

398
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:57,668
divorce court I'm called an asshole

399
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:02,599
you gotta mention it wasn't divorce

400
00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:05,899
court cuz I'm assuming that happens a

401
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:07,549
lot in divorce court the defense

402
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:08,869
attorney I was doing some work shutting

403
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:10,759
a company down because they were running

404
00:19:08,869 --> 00:19:12,259
those scams you have a virus and the

405
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:14,239
defense attorney called me an asshole in

406
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:15,409
the deposition and I don't know what to

407
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:19,249
say because I was under oath so I said

408
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:20,690
yes I am I think when I testified the

409
00:19:19,249 --> 00:19:23,499
judge said hey wait maybe you're the

410
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:29,210
asshole aren't you yes your honor

411
00:19:23,499 --> 00:19:30,710
I don't know what to say to that couple

412
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,539
months I'm testifying for the Department

413
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:35,210
of Justice on that same case so I'll be

414
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:37,609
a federally Court recognized asshole I

415
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:40,399
think this is a con accomplishment right

416
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:42,499
like it doesn't help arguments with my

417
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:46,639
wife though cuz she can call me an

418
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:49,340
asshole and I can't argue it but so but

419
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:50,570
we I'm not a nice person is what it

420
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,249
boils down to but I didn't want to

421
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,960
embarrass this guy and I go and I look

422
00:19:52,249 --> 00:19:56,210
at the blog and the blog has some really

423
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,619
good information and it has some really

424
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:02,570
shitty information and then I realize

425
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:04,580
with the screenshots the person has is

426
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,139
that the tool set the person was using

427
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,330
and I don't know whether that person

428
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:10,699
wrote the tool set or they use somebody

429
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:13,519
right like I don't know but the tool set

430
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:16,639
referred to it as decrypting md5 hashes

431
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:20,450
I went out I've seen documentation from

432
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:25,039
major companies that teach information

433
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:28,399
wrong hell for years Microsoft gave bad

434
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:31,869
information in their documentation now

435
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:31,869
Oracle has taken over that title

436
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:39,620
we teach people badly right how many

437
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,740
people here have gone to college for

438
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:45,439
computer science how many people here in

439
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:50,030
college were taught security techniques

440
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:53,240
and requirements and whatever I'll point

441
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:54,950
out for the people who don't notice lots

442
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,590
of hands went up for the first question

443
00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:00,559
and I think I saw four hands for the

444
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:03,168
second question right we're not teaching

445
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,658
it I go into a high school because one

446
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:08,630
of the things we do at secure ideas is

447
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:10,039
that we try to push education as a

448
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:13,100
matter of fact we push it so hard

449
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:15,200
I own a six-day web pentesting course

450
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:19,908
that we can't say what it was written

451
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:23,240
for because that's wrong but you can

452
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:24,500
look at my resume and we open source the

453
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,530
entire 6 day course

454
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,000
just over a year and a half ago that's

455
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:31,549
how important we think education is

456
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,929
right and I'm not gonna say that

457
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:36,850
information is right I'd like to believe

458
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:36,850
it was right I wrote it and I'm a genius

459
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,918
but we want to make sure the data is out

460
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:46,189
there another problem we have that

461
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:51,260
didn't flip I'll walk over here and flip

462
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:55,159
it no now it flips do you see that it

463
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:58,250
knew I was coming it waited now to slip

464
00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:01,700
a lot the other problem we have is what

465
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:03,559
do we teach right I get asked all the

466
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,770
time how do I become you how do I get a

467
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:09,980
job like you and I I say up here most

468
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:14,000
people don't even know the path and the

469
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:17,630
pun is totally intended so the IT nerds

470
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,490
in the room get it I hope because way

471
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:23,630
too many security people I talk to don't

472
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:26,120
know how to manage a window system they

473
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:28,280
don't know how to install software they

474
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,309
know how to pen test right they

475
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,668
downloaded Kali or samurai WTF and they

476
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:38,149
ran some tools and then they got a job

477
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:40,700
right I read the threads I won and have

478
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,980
moderated mailing lists and forums and

479
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,539
boards of conversation and I see the

480
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:47,820
questions right

481
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:49,139
downloaded this software and I I uh I

482
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,509
don't know how to install it

483
00:22:49,139 --> 00:22:57,418
double-click on it do I double click

484
00:22:51,509 --> 00:23:00,629
with the mouse I've taught classes on

485
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:03,600
web pentesting where I have literally

486
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:06,418
had to have a facilitator sit next to a

487
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,189
student so that when they got to the

488
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:11,879
exercise and the first step in the

489
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:13,919
exercise was open Firefox the

490
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:17,269
facilitator could reach over and double

491
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,320
click on the Firefox icon on the desktop

492
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:23,220
because the person didn't know how to do

493
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:26,428
that and I was morally bound to not

494
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:30,960
describe in the exercise steps how to

495
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:33,720
double click on Firefox and you think

496
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,340
I'm exaggerating we hear all the time

497
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,960
right

498
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:40,070
yeah I saw it on Twitter just last week

499
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,950
and ranted about it

500
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:47,850
SMS is insecure so we should remove all

501
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:50,159
SMS two-factor from our accounts at

502
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:54,990
least a hundred InfoSec professionals

503
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:57,539
shared that tidbit last week really we

504
00:23:54,990 --> 00:24:00,210
should remove SMS 2 factor because SMS

505
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:05,070
is insecure did you recommend another

506
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:06,389
option no I don't know don't get me

507
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,350
wrong I'm not argue I'm not saying up

508
00:24:06,389 --> 00:24:09,418
here I don't want anybody walking out

509
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,259
here going Kevin's a moron he said SMS

510
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:13,470
is secure

511
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:16,379
no I didn't but I will tell you that SMS

512
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:20,779
two-factor authentication is more secure

513
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:23,219
than no two-factor authentication right

514
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:25,350
but we don't understand that well enough

515
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:29,570
as a community the other problem we have

516
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:32,610
is where do we go to get into this right

517
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:34,769
how do I go from being that high school

518
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:38,459
student or that college kid to be a pen

519
00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:40,619
tester I want to be very clear in my

520
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,220
opinion and since I have the microphone

521
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:43,220
I'm right

522
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:51,770
that is not a single step and we talk to

523
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,570
people all the time right hey I'm in

524
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,760
college right now I'd like to be hired

525
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:58,570
by secure ideas as a penetration tester

526
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:02,360
my answer is well that's nice too like

527
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:05,840
it's important to have goals you're not

528
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:08,840
gonna meet that one because in my

529
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,639
opinion and I will point out that while

530
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,110
it's not I'm right because I have the

531
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,130
mic it's I'm right because I do the

532
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:19,580
hiring it's secure ideas owners

533
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:21,290
privilege if you want to be a senior

534
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,449
security consultant secure ideas you

535
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:28,190
have to have a decade of experience as

536
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:29,420
an IT admin or a developer because I

537
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,110
don't give a about your ability to

538
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:33,590
pen test

539
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:35,060
I don't these people come to me and

540
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:39,110
they're like oh I wrote a buffer

541
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:41,210
overflow yeah so did my 9 year old cuz

542
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:43,399
she read an article on the Internet and

543
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:45,020
I don't mean to downplay the difficulty

544
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,720
of writing a buffer overflow what I do

545
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:50,660
mean to downplay why that's so

546
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,880
important what we're supposed to know

547
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:55,310
how to do is to understand how that

548
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,820
buffer overflow impacts the business

549
00:25:55,310 --> 00:26:00,649
we're consulting for which is why I want

550
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:03,439
you to have 10 years of experience as an

551
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:06,020
IT person I want you to know what it's

552
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,930
like to be up at 3 a.m.

553
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:11,290
fixing the server that you broke let's

554
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,290
admit it

555
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,610
[Music]

556
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:18,970
and having to fix it by the next morning

557
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:23,399
I want you to know what it's like to set

558
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:26,050
up a majordomo mail list yes I'm old

559
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:28,240
subscribe yourself to it to test it send

560
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:30,550
the test email sip it worked go home

561
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,610
come back the next day to two and a half

562
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:35,860
million emails in your inbox because you

563
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:45,939
were the idiot that subscribed the list

564
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:47,860
server to the listserv thank you yeah I

565
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:52,420
found out how many messages it took to

566
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:53,679
crash exchange but uh right and the

567
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,660
reason I want you to know that is not

568
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:58,750
just because I want another story to

569
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:01,240
laugh at you about I do but because I

570
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:03,550
want you to understand the impact your

571
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,370
recommendation as a security person has

572
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:09,700
on the business I see it all the time

573
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:11,320
because I'll tell you one of my jobs we

574
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,690
have this service called SAS tow where

575
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,010
we do advisory for companies and we we

576
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:17,170
work with developers and things like

577
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:19,960
that so we read a lot of other companies

578
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:24,760
pen test reports and let me tell you

579
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:27,790
right now many many people are morons

580
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:30,879
writing reports I'm not even gonna argue

581
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:33,100
the putting your logo on an SS report

582
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,450
does not make it a pen test because if

583
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:39,639
you think that you're too dumb to learn

584
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:43,720
but I will argue that telling an

585
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:47,830
organization that has sequel injection

586
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:50,350
in their login field how their

587
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:52,929
clickjacking implementation is not good

588
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:55,959
enough means you don't understand how

589
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:57,910
applications work you don't understand

590
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,710
risk you don't understand and that's a

591
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:04,690
problem right and I'm not claiming I do

592
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:08,020
I've been a moron for longer than ever

593
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:12,040
and every day I realize how dumb I

594
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:13,690
actually am when I got involved in in IT

595
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:16,149
to become a security person when I

596
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:18,450
decided I wanted to be a security person

597
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:20,940
I literally sat down and wrote

598
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,770
a list of the ten things I needed to

599
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,660
know and I'm not a list person but I

600
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:26,820
wrote down the ten things I needed to

601
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:29,250
know to call myself an information

602
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:33,360
security person and I learned one of the

603
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:36,090
10 and I had a list of 23 things I

604
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,879
needed to learn and I learned one of the

605
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:43,919
things and I had a list of 45 items I

606
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:46,890
needed to learn I'm now at a point where

607
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,000
the list is so big I had to buy a new

608
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:51,270
hard drive okay

609
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,440
I like I like Google Drive because they

610
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:58,050
haven't limited my list I know less now

611
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,270
percentage-wise than I knew then because

612
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:03,419
now I know a whole bunch of the I

613
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:05,610
don't even know I didn't know which

614
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:08,220
scares me even more because tomorrow

615
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:11,939
I'll learn four more things I didn't

616
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:16,200
even need to know I needed to know it's

617
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:19,200
scary and awesome because I like

618
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:22,220
learning right the other problem we see

619
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:26,150
is how do you how do you get a skill set

620
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:32,010
how do you prove I'm a pen tester right

621
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:34,710
I know a way hack Amazon works for kevin

622
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:38,580
Mitnick okay it wasn't Amazon because it

623
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:41,430
was in like the 30s but uh I might be

624
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:45,570
exaggerating slightly I do that with

625
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:49,110
scum right oh yeah I said it

626
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:52,610
and I've said it before I will talk

627
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:56,100
about that next do the ethics bullet

628
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:58,469
right we have to learn and we have to

629
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,820
have a safe place to learn and one of

630
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,920
the things that a lot of people do is I

631
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,629
always capture the flags and I want to

632
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,830
be clear I don't have a problem with

633
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:08,040
capture the flags that are set up

634
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:09,300
correctly and authorized okay but I will

635
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,800
tell you that most of the capture the

636
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:13,889
flag is environments I've looked at

637
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:17,669
aren't actually relevant to the real

638
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:21,120
world okay and that's a challenge to

639
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:22,380
improve them not to bash them but you

640
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,669
need a place to practice

641
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:29,100
that's why samurai WTF exists it's why

642
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:31,250
things like the cyber ranges exist I

643
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:34,820
think it's a good idea to go

644
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:36,440
get information about environments you

645
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,020
can play with work with your local

646
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,730
schools work with your local companies

647
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:43,280
if you're not in a security company

648
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,480
let's say you work it Express Scripts

649
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,639
I'm just gonna pick on them because they

650
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,230
were mentioned as one of the sponsors if

651
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,880
I was Express Scripts

652
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:53,080
and I want to be clear I have no idea if

653
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:55,549
they do this or not if I was them I

654
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,070
would take one of our development

655
00:30:55,549 --> 00:31:02,270
environments and I would set it up in a

656
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:06,950
way to allow our people to practice and

657
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:09,530
test and and learn how to hack it there

658
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:11,809
in the company set aside build a rules

659
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:12,530
of engagement all that kind of stuff but

660
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:17,389
what you're gonna do is you're gonna

661
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:18,320
build up skillset safely right guess

662
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:21,100
where you're gonna be able to use that

663
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,870
skill set at your company

664
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:27,980
now some people recommend bug bounties

665
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:30,350
I don't not as a place to learn once

666
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,390
you've learned if you want to go out and

667
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:34,939
join bug bounty programs to practice

668
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:37,850
that's fine but I don't recommend

669
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:39,770
learning how to pen test on somebody

670
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:41,059
else's bug bounty and the reason I say

671
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:43,789
that is because more than likely you're

672
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:46,309
going to go out of scope for what the

673
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:47,150
bug bounty is because you're learning

674
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:48,950
okay

675
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:51,289
it's not negative I'm not bashing you

676
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:53,960
just that's what happens we see it too

677
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:55,820
often okay and so we got to do it

678
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,210
the other thing we have to do is we have

679
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:02,000
to learn ethics we as an industry spend

680
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:04,640
too much time put in people like kevin

681
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,370
Mitnick and chris Roberts up on

682
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,230
pedestals right and we look at these

683
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:14,658
people saying hey there's three oh my

684
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:17,210
god he flew a plane sideways right and

685
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:18,950
we put them on stage we have people who

686
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:21,409
stand up on stage and talk about the

687
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:23,870
illegal stuff they did and we all

688
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:26,900
applaud and cheer them and they go to

689
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:29,539
the next conference what we should be

690
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:32,870
doing and I'd like to believe I do but I

691
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:35,330
can't claim for myself but I believe

692
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:37,479
what we should be doing is advocating

693
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:40,370
for people doing things responsibly

694
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,620
people who are working to improve things

695
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:44,209
because I'll tell you right now if we

696
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:48,129
don't start being

697
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:52,310
ethically we're gonna get this shutdown

698
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:53,390
right and too often I see and I I'm not

699
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:55,159
talking about this conference because

700
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:57,740
you all of course are 100 percent

701
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:59,390
ethical but I go to way too many

702
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,300
conferences where the elevator is broken

703
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:03,470
by the second day of the conference

704
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:05,990
because some idiot thought it'd be fun

705
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:09,020
to play with it or the screens are

706
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:10,340
messed up or there's 27 extra ATMs that

707
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:15,170
weren't there at the beginning of the

708
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:18,709
conference right hey you know what I'm

709
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:20,450
talking about right we have to really

710
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:22,070
think about the ethics now I want to

711
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:25,370
point out that I said ethics not

712
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:28,730
legalities because there are things that

713
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:31,639
are legal I don't consider ethical and

714
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:34,010
we can have that debate if you want and

715
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,120
I won't claim that I don't break my own

716
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:37,220
ethics because I'll tell you right now

717
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,709
you mess with either of my daughters or

718
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:43,570
my wife although my ethics just became

719
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:47,690
really flexible I wouldn't need that

720
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:50,290
because I love that and I'm not a big

721
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:58,550
strong guy who can beat your ass

722
00:33:50,290 --> 00:34:00,290
but right and I want to be very clear

723
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:02,840
that one of the reasons this is so

724
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:06,950
important to me is because I'm where I

725
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:12,340
am today because I got to stand on the

726
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:14,780
shoulders of amazing people and I hope

727
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:16,940
to be the set of shoulders other people

728
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:18,710
can stand on and I've put some of the

729
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,810
people that matter to me up here of

730
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:23,120
course there is a picture of both of my

731
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:26,060
daughters that's on purpose all right

732
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,219
they're not that young anymore but I've

733
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:31,040
got people Jason who's my business

734
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:32,509
partner Jason is amazing I can't tell

735
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,489
you the number of times I go to Jason

736
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:40,070
and say hey what do you think about this

737
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:43,729
idea and he centers me he focuses me on

738
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:46,370
what the right thing to do is people

739
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:50,990
like Mike poor who I worked for it in

740
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:54,889
guardians and I grew as a consultant as

741
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:56,168
a man as a person because of Mike's

742
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:58,868
leadership

743
00:34:56,168 --> 00:35:01,660
his ability to talk about what was okay

744
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:05,880
to do and you've got people like James

745
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:09,160
fields who I worked with at Blue Cross

746
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:12,040
where I really feel like every single

747
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:16,899
time I talked to him I left the

748
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:20,440
conversation a better person I want

749
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:23,559
every one of us to have that impact on

750
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,720
everybody we interact with if I have a

751
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:28,510
conversation with you I want to walk

752
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:31,629
away better I want to walk away smarter

753
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:32,799
I want to walk away knowing more I will

754
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,430
admit that if you have a conversation

755
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:36,160
with me

756
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:38,169
you will leave knowing more even if all

757
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,950
you leave with is knowing more that you

758
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:50,559
don't ever want to talk to me again that

759
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:52,720
is more right sorry but this is what we

760
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:55,000
got to do this is how we need to fix

761
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,520
this right we have to be like these

762
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,500
people right the last person up there

763
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,259
that you may not recognize his Alban

764
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:07,230
Johnson he's the founder of the 501st

765
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:12,130
legion right and that's our to Katie

766
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:13,900
Alvin's daughter was sick she died and

767
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:15,819
she wanted in our two unit to watch over

768
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,530
her when she was sick and in the

769
00:36:15,819 --> 00:36:20,950
hospital and the astromech builders

770
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:23,950
built our to Katie and so she now

771
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:26,558
travels the world raising money for a

772
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:30,819
variety of charities is why they're up

773
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:33,670
there right but we have to look at what

774
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:36,759
we do we have to look at how we interact

775
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:39,880
and and I've got to be honest and tell

776
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:43,750
you that very many times I fail at that

777
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:45,369
I look back at my day and I remember

778
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:48,730
that conversation I had with a Comcast

779
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:52,010
person and how many times I use those

780
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:54,420
words that I won't repeat now

781
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:56,280
comcast has more recordings of me

782
00:36:54,420 --> 00:37:03,810
cursing at people than anybody else

783
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:05,130
should but they deserved it but I think

784
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:06,360
back to how I interact with people I

785
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:08,190
think back how I interacted with the

786
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:12,270
customers I think about how I talked to

787
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:15,210
people outside and there are days where

788
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:17,700
I look back on it and I'm ashamed of

789
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:21,810
what I did and what I said and how I

790
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:25,470
worked and I think to myself I got to do

791
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:28,140
better and there are days if I may say

792
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:31,230
so myself that I look back on and I

793
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:36,150
think man I'm really happy with me today

794
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:41,460
I did good I helped people I felt like I

795
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:44,820
taught people I feel better about me and

796
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:48,150
my goal in life is for that second day

797
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:51,120
to happen way more often than the first

798
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:52,560
day but the thing we have to remember

799
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:56,630
and this is something I've struggled

800
00:37:52,560 --> 00:38:00,960
with for years is it failing one time

801
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:02,430
isn't a sign of failure it's failing to

802
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,510
get up and be do better the next time

803
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:08,339
and I'm gonna fail again I'll tell you

804
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:09,270
right now there's a good chance that on

805
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,130
the way to the airport

806
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:14,740
somebody's gonna piss me off

807
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:16,570
because it's the summer and all the

808
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:22,839
people who don't know how to travel or

809
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:28,330
traveling just take off your damn shoes

810
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:31,180
I don't have to do that anymore anxiety

811
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:32,170
is a pre-check but now we have the

812
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:34,120
people who don't know they're not

813
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:37,540
supposed to take off their shoes in that

814
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:40,509
line I don't understand why that

815
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:46,990
irritates me as much as it does put them

816
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:50,620
back on but I tried right

817
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:54,790
and my goal is for you to try the same

818
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:56,799
way yourself so what do we do

819
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:59,830
I've talked about it a lot I've talked

820
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,540
about the problem I've rambled on said

821
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:05,770
some stupid jokes I'll say some more

822
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:06,580
stupid jokes we have time I'm full of

823
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:11,320
stupid jokes

824
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:15,310
for lots of things my eyes are brown so

825
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:19,390
what do we do in my opinion the way we

826
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:22,240
fix this okay and this is huge

827
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:24,069
I admit that right I have outlined four

828
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,899
thousand different things that are wrong

829
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,280
I might be exaggerating slightly I've

830
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:30,100
talked about the fact that our education

831
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:34,540
system is failing us right we are

832
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:38,680
teaching people how to use Java applets

833
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:40,390
in college and then beating them up when

834
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,710
they use Java applets on our stuff

835
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:46,000
except for Cisco because for some reason

836
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:48,580
they get away with it why do we accept

837
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,190
that from John Cisco I don't understand

838
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,690
that's it separated or you as you know

839
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:56,320
how you can tell it recognized at Cisco

840
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:58,810
admins workstation there's 13 different

841
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:05,740
versions of Java running for the various

842
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:07,420
two right yeah damn it I love those

843
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,959
machines because I can hack them better

844
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,960
but

845
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:17,440
we we've I've outlined that we have an

846
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:19,840
education problem I've outlined that we

847
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,310
have a price problem we have a skills

848
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,300
gap whatever we want to call it we got

849
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:23,920
to come up with a better name because

850
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:27,070
skills gap has become the same thing as

851
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:29,590
like zero day protection have you seen

852
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:31,450
that marketing flaw zero day protection

853
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:33,400
now I know at the market at the vendor

854
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:34,810
meant they meant they would protect you

855
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,940
before you knew the vulnerability

856
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:38,950
existed but in my head zero day

857
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,690
protection a zero day

858
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,950
right oh no I'm sorry negative day

859
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:44,590
protection is what they refer to it as

860
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:46,180
zero day is a vulnerability exists and

861
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:48,490
we don't have a patch right we all agree

862
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,899
on that definition so a negative day in

863
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:52,450
my book is the vulnerability doesn't

864
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:56,170
exist I'm here to announce security as

865
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:58,029
new product it's negative day protection

866
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:59,410
it's an agentless software list

867
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:02,950
controlled there's not even a dashboard

868
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:05,529
we guarantee that we will protect all of

869
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:11,560
your systems from vulnerabilities that

870
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:14,020
don't exist right done that's kind of

871
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,549
like the PCI counsel saying that no PCI

872
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:18,220
compliant organization has ever been

873
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:20,859
breached have you heard that do you know

874
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:22,480
why they can honestly say that because

875
00:41:20,859 --> 00:41:25,330
being breached makes you out of

876
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,119
compliance with PCI like it's automatic

877
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:31,598
so they can absolutely say if you are

878
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:34,900
compliant you weren't breached semantics

879
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,730
it's so much fun I should have been a

880
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,700
marketing guy no I shouldn't have been a

881
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:41,260
marketing guy I mean the wrong person to

882
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,868
put in front of a group and say hey buy

883
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:47,230
our stuff but because I'm the birds like

884
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:50,130
you wanna buy our stuff this you do you

885
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:52,480
don't know maybe you do I don't know but

886
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:55,119
we've also talked about how do we build

887
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:58,990
this up and in my answer my opinion

888
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,880
the answer is mentoring now I talked to

889
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:02,348
somebody earlier and he said and I agree

890
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,119
with him that the term mentoring is

891
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:08,980
overused way too much he's right we

892
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:11,670
talked about it but we don't really

893
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,670
define it

894
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:22,970
your job your job every person in this

895
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:24,920
room job is to mentor other people I'd

896
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:27,680
like you to be formal but informal

897
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,819
mentoring is just as important you

898
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,950
should constantly be teaching people

899
00:42:28,819 --> 00:42:32,420
stuff you should constantly be answering

900
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:36,140
questions you should constantly be

901
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:38,390
learning yourself so that you can what I

902
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:40,339
like to see and what we recommend quite

903
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:43,549
often and what we help implement quite

904
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:47,509
often is mentoring programs where we

905
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:50,270
will take a security team and we will

906
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:52,640
have the mentor the IT people the

907
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:54,619
developers the QA people the project

908
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,720
management people we have them teach

909
00:42:54,619 --> 00:43:00,770
them and show them and guide them into

910
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:02,509
what security means because it ties to

911
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:03,980
what I said earlier that the way to make

912
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,720
sure somebody has the right skill set is

913
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:08,359
to give them a background in building

914
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:13,149
things in making things in supporting

915
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:17,390
things if I can go to my developers and

916
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:20,060
show them what security means and help

917
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:24,470
guide them at building out a secure

918
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:27,140
product right the next time I need

919
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:29,629
somebody on my security team I have this

920
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:31,520
staff already I have the people that I

921
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:34,540
know that not only do they know what I

922
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:37,910
want them to know because I showed them

923
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:40,430
but they already work with me even if I

924
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:42,259
don't pull them into my team even if I

925
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:43,700
just continue to work with them as part

926
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,859
of the development team or the QA team

927
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:51,200
or the project management team or the

928
00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:54,529
management team they will do better at

929
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:56,868
security and we see this I want to be

930
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:58,280
blunt we have a product we sell I'm not

931
00:43:56,869 --> 00:44:00,440
trying to sell you I am I'm always

932
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:03,140
trying to sell but we have a product we

933
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,819
sell called SATA the strategic

934
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,460
application security training and

935
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:12,500
advisory program it's literally a

936
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:15,770
program where we mentor your development

937
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:20,390
staff we mentor your security staff on

938
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:22,460
an ongoing basis right now don't get me

939
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:24,970
wrong as a greedy capitalist I will tell

940
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:28,130
you come sign up pay us we'll do it

941
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:29,390
but there's nothing patentable Todd not

942
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:32,660
sure if that's a real word but let's go

943
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:37,970
with it right for this mentoring program

944
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:40,670
anybody can do it you sit there and you

945
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:43,189
work with people what we do and I'm

946
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:45,350
describing our product because I believe

947
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:46,460
it's the right way to do it I'm also

948
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,440
going to describe it in enough detail

949
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:50,110
you need to do it yourself and not buy

950
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:54,580
it from us okay

951
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:58,610
I'd rather you buy it from us but first

952
00:44:54,580 --> 00:45:01,580
every two weeks there's an hour to to

953
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:04,900
our live session where we sit down with

954
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:09,860
whatever people are able to sign in and

955
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:12,320
we teach them various topics of security

956
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:13,880
so today we'll talk about using

957
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,320
parameterize queries and sequel

958
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:18,020
injection and blah blah blah blah blah

959
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:20,360
right tomorrow next week or two weeks

960
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:22,220
from now we'll talk about how to work

961
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,050
within a web app firewall and why it

962
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:26,899
doesn't solve all the problems and how

963
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:29,300
to tune it and what-have-you right

964
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:33,940
two weeks from then we'll talk about I

965
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:37,490
am and it's two fact right whatever okay

966
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:40,280
then the rest of the time one those

967
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:41,899
sessions are recorded and my answer to

968
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,570
you and I know many people don't like

969
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:46,460
this I don't like being recorded okay

970
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:47,870
but when you do a learning session

971
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:50,330
record it and the reason you should

972
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:52,310
record it is one you should review it so

973
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:54,049
that you verify how you do it that you

974
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:57,350
did the right thing that you can improve

975
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:58,700
yourself two by recording it allows

976
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:02,480
people to review it at their own pace

977
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:06,710
right so that helps second you have

978
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:08,390
regular open office hours where a person

979
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:12,260
who knows what they're doing that's

980
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:13,549
critical is available to hold somebody's

981
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:16,280
hand as they're doing something

982
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:17,630
themselves whether it's hey we got this

983
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,890
report from Barrett code and we don't

984
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:20,480
understand what this finding means or

985
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:21,830
hey we have this new thing we're

986
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,930
implementing and we're not sure if we're

987
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:25,819
doing it correctly or hey we're doing

988
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:27,859
this test this is we're building a unit

989
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:29,840
test and we need help making sure it's

990
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:33,230
right whatever it is you have open up

991
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:35,720
ten hours end you have a regular

992
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:37,950
communication path outside of those open

993
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,930
office hours we use slack

994
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:42,328
we have a slot channel that the people

995
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:43,680
who have subscribed sign in to and we

996
00:46:42,329 --> 00:46:45,390
give them and we guarantee them a

997
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,069
response time of like I think it's 20

998
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:49,290
minutes you don't have to do the

999
00:46:47,069 --> 00:46:51,900
guarantee we're a paid service so we

1000
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:53,940
have to do an SLA right but you want to

1001
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,309
make sure that you don't desert whatever

1002
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,450
communication channel you built like a

1003
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:58,920
lot of people I see they'll do it by

1004
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:00,390
email if you have a question to email me

1005
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,770
and I'll answer your question and then

1006
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:04,740
they just get busy and they ignore the

1007
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:07,770
emails right or they think I'll get to

1008
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:09,808
that later I do that I regularly will

1009
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:11,579
see an email in the morning and think to

1010
00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:13,170
myself okay I'm ready to know something

1011
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:15,270
I'll work with this this afternoon and

1012
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:16,799
then what happens is like 3 o'clock in

1013
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:20,000
the morning call dammit I gotta get that

1014
00:47:16,799 --> 00:47:25,170
eat right like so don't do that ok and

1015
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:29,280
then make sure that the other direction

1016
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:31,260
works as well so as I'm talking to these

1017
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,329
developers about how we test stuff for

1018
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:35,490
them we do screen shares as we're pen

1019
00:47:33,329 --> 00:47:36,869
testing so that they can see what we're

1020
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:39,720
testing how we're testing it right

1021
00:47:36,869 --> 00:47:42,960
things like that at the same time we

1022
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:45,930
regularly talk to them about the

1023
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,579
technologies they're evaluating we talk

1024
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,930
to them about the technologies there oh

1025
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:51,589
you're using vagrant now oh you're using

1026
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:54,839
Crippen idiots oh you're using em

1027
00:47:51,589 --> 00:47:56,790
whatever mustard seed libraries or

1028
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:59,849
whatever I made that one up probably

1029
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:02,009
exists but right oh we're using Gatsby

1030
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:04,680
oh cool I've not used Gatsby yet let me

1031
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:07,829
look at that look at write whatever okay

1032
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:12,629
you should be learning as much from them

1033
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:14,309
as they're learning from you if you're

1034
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:17,369
not in applications fine

1035
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:19,500
mentors the helpdesk person who has a

1036
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:21,690
dream of being a I'm gonna say

1037
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:24,780
full-blown IT person I hoped as people

1038
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:26,640
our IT people but we're without this

1039
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:29,609
person work with the asset management

1040
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,950
person work with the project manager who

1041
00:48:29,609 --> 00:48:33,750
has to evaluate whether or not that

1042
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:36,210
project can go forward and we can use it

1043
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:39,270
or what have you because way too often

1044
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:41,760
we ignore the business side in these

1045
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:44,460
learning engagements we focus on the

1046
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,750
Nerds why because we talked to her it's

1047
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:49,950
fine right we relate to the nerve

1048
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:51,900
but I'll tell you right now that project

1049
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:54,470
manager she was going to determine

1050
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:58,560
whether you get budget next year right

1051
00:48:54,470 --> 00:49:02,399
that branch manager district manager

1052
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:06,150
that you eighty person whatever title

1053
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:08,430
you want to come up with one of the best

1054
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:12,530
pen testers I ever worked with one of

1055
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:12,529
the best pen testers I ever worked with

1056
00:49:12,589 --> 00:49:20,099
was from the help desk and her job

1057
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:24,140
before she was on the help desk where

1058
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:26,400
she was a hostess at a restaurant right

1059
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:27,960
and she was one of the best pen testers

1060
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,609
I ever worked with and the reason she

1061
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,079
was one of the best pet investors in my

1062
00:49:29,609 --> 00:49:34,859
opinion other than the fact she was a

1063
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:37,829
genius but it was also because and this

1064
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:39,000
sounds weird but the four or five years

1065
00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:41,430
or whatever it was that she was a

1066
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,900
hostess standing in front of the public

1067
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:45,750
telling they had to wait for their

1068
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:49,260
dinner she learned how to interact with

1069
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:50,910
people way better than I can write it

1070
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,920
says she knew how to talk to people and

1071
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:55,379
not get them angry and give them

1072
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,030
information but they weren't gonna like

1073
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:59,099
hearing because let me tell you right

1074
00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:00,630
now your company's been working on that

1075
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:03,540
application that they're deploying next

1076
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:05,310
week for six years and you're about to

1077
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:08,579
tell them that the underlying framework

1078
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:10,650
they developed is insecure you're not

1079
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:14,099
going to be popular at the next change

1080
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:18,690
control meeting right been there done

1081
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:20,520
that I have the t-shirt right they learn

1082
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:24,569
how to talk to people that's what we

1083
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:27,599
have to do we have to mentor we have to

1084
00:50:24,569 --> 00:50:30,329
show people how we do this so I've

1085
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:34,770
outlined how we do it and I want to be

1086
00:50:30,329 --> 00:50:36,690
very clear the way we do it very little

1087
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:38,579
cost and I don't mean very little cost

1088
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:41,369
to the customer it is very little cost I

1089
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:43,260
want to say it's 1,500 to $3,500 a month

1090
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:46,440
depending on how many people you put

1091
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:50,490
through the program right and the reason

1092
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:53,880
I point that out is we are a consulting

1093
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:55,439
firm the only reason every two weeks I'm

1094
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:59,940
able to pay payroll is because people

1095
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:01,050
hire me we are a cash flow business we

1096
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:06,060
don't have venture capital

1097
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:07,890
we're not a unicorn we're not IPO it the

1098
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:13,310
only way I pay payroll every two weeks

1099
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:18,560
is people hire me if I can afford to

1100
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:21,720
have somebody full-time mentoring people

1101
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:24,600
at a subscription rate of a $1,500 a

1102
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:27,660
month you can do it inside your

1103
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:32,130
organization just as cheaply right

1104
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:36,480
seriously it's not expensive to help

1105
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:39,990
people there is a cost one of the costs

1106
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,630
is your time and your time is valuable

1107
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:44,490
what is it

1108
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:47,660
86,400 seconds a year a day or whatever

1109
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:50,819
it is right and every second you waste

1110
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:53,009
I'm not gonna sing I sing horrible I

1111
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:55,350
sing so bad my grandfather had to leave

1112
00:51:53,010 --> 00:52:00,990
church when I was a kid because he was

1113
00:51:55,350 --> 00:52:03,930
