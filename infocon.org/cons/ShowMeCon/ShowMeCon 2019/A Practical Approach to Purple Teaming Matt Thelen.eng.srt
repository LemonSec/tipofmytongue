1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,420
awesome good morning welcome to show me

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,700
Khan I'm just real quick let's give a

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,980
huge round of applause to date and Renee

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,040
and rest of the staff that put this on

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:20,310
this is a big thing to put together and

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:22,109
they always do an awesome job I'm very

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,669
excited to be here I get my name is Matt

8
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,180
Phelan and today I want to talk to you

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,619
about an approach to purple teaming now

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,230
keep in mind this is an approach with

11
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,809
many different components and since all

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,520
organizations are different utilize the

13
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,199
components that make the most sense for

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,090
your organization so keep that in mind

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,829
as I kind of go through this with you

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:46,320
today I always like hearing the stories

17
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,480
of how people got into the security

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,149
community and so I'll briefly share with

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,849
you my little journey into information

20
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,590
security I grew up out in jonesburg

21
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,940
Missouri anybody know where jonesburg

22
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:02,460
Surrey is nice it's an extremely small

23
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,289
town so small that when I was growing up

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,900
there we didn't even have a single

25
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,820
stoplight I mean it's very small but it

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:13,020
is about 25 miles west of Wynn's Ville

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,059
and anyway so I graduated high school

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,570
and decided that I wanted to go to the

29
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,939
army

30
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,699
so I enlisted as an 11 Bravo which is an

31
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,619
infantryman and after completing basic

32
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,890
down at Georgia my first duty station

33
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,479
was Fort Wainwright Alaska so you know

34
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,880
not the southern part of Alaska way way

35
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,579
up north so I spent three years there

36
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,439
and then I I told the recruiter that I

37
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,029
would reenlist if they could promise me

38
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,658
that wherever he sent me it would never

39
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,400
snow and so I found myself at a

40
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,640
Schofield Barracks Hawaii for a couple

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,340
years couple years there I came not

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,130
worse to deployed to Iraq and after a

43
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,130
year there I decided that you know

44
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,079
sleeping in the mud sand and snow for

45
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,810
3045 days at a time was starting to get

46
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,389
old so I decided to get out and pursue a

47
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,939
bachelor's degree in information system

48
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,439
security

49
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:06,479
unlike many pen testers and even some

50
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,630
other folks in IT you know I didn't grow

51
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,160
up with a Commodore 64

52
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,600
the age of 10 right I didn't know

53
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,390
anything about computers until I got

54
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,780
into college in 2005

55
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:20,269
luckily my first semester in school I

56
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,950
landed my first IT job at a small

57
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:25,790
consulting firm in Lincoln County

58
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:29,480
Missouri spent a couple years there and

59
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:31,910
then in 2008 I moved into a more

60
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,929
security focused role at a consulting

61
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:37,850
company in Chesterfield Missouri with

62
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,500
that role I would go out to clients and

63
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:42,680
do things such as business impact

64
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,110
analysis vulnerability scanning some

65
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,240
white pen testing but what I found is

66
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,670
before I left the clients I would be

67
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,400
fixing Outlook fonts doing printer

68
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:54,530
support and so it was in 2013 I decided

69
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,780
to make the leap full-time into

70
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,700
information security and I moved to

71
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,310
Enterprise Holdings where I'm currently

72
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,720
a pen tester and over the last couple

73
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,270
years we put a lot of effort around

74
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,370
purple teaming and so what I want to

75
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,770
present to you today is just some of the

76
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,900
stuff that I learned along the way as we

77
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,250
kind of put this together and I do have

78
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,500
to give some shoutouts to my family

79
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,760
they're very supportive there's been

80
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,610
many nights where I was studying for a

81
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:23,739
certification or prepping for the

82
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:26,630
presentation so very thankful for them

83
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,250
so I want to talk about what purple

84
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,260
teaming is I'm sure everybody hears

85
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,420
heard purple teaming in some form or

86
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,880
fashion so I want to talk about what

87
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,399
that is and how that differs from other

88
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,760
sorts of testing I want to talk about

89
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,320
some considerations and challenges so

90
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,989
perhaps you have already got a purple

91
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,549
teaming programme stood up or you're

92
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,780
looking to stand one up I just want to

93
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,330
talk about some of the challenges and

94
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,640
considerations you may face as you're

95
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:55,400
doing that also a framework that you can

96
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,410
leverage to do do many things right

97
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,290
measure your coverage and depth of

98
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,870
coverage do things such as measuring

99
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:06,250
your success and then I'll wrap it up

100
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:10,069
with some examples and takeaways

101
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:12,500
so what is purple teaming so terminology

102
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:14,350
berries across the industry you'll hear

103
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,298
things such as control tuning or

104
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,529
adversary simulation for the purpose of

105
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,060
this talk I'm just gonna call it purple

106
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:22,849
teaming it seems to be kind of the most

107
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,850
well known term but purple teaming is a

108
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:28,100
function centered around communication

109
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:30,440
between the red teams and the blue teams

110
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,010
your red teams being your adversaries

111
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,180
and your blue teams being your defenders

112
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:38,690
but it's a cooperation and mutual

113
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:41,570
benefit towards a common goal which is

114
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:45,620
improving the security posture of the

115
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:47,080
organization now most testing does that

116
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,210
right if you look at any sort of

117
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:53,120
security testing almost all of that

118
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:55,789
ultimately is there to improve security

119
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,680
posture of the organization I'm gonna if

120
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,140
you look at red teaming it's more of an

121
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,290
objective based assessment to achieve a

122
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,010
specific goal right you're looking at

123
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,710
compromising a business critical

124
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:09,349
application or you're looking at getting

125
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,120
domain administrator a lot of times that

126
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,030
testing is carried out without the blue

127
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,810
team ever even knowing about it you're

128
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:20,599
gonna have I times such as physical

129
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,370
assessments social engineering all those

130
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,780
will be within scope of a typical red

131
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:28,190
team if you look at pen testing pen

132
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,020
testing is generally smaller and scope

133
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:33,289
you're looking at testing you know a web

134
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,870
application or an API could be a network

135
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:38,240
segment or even a mobile app but the

136
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,430
goal there is to find as many

137
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,700
exploitable vulnerabilities as you can

138
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:45,650
in the given time frame and the reason

139
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:49,070
to do that is to look at the true risk

140
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,750
right when I got into pen testing pen

141
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,310
testing of vulnerability scanning were

142
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,720
pretty much as anonymous right there

143
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,360
were a lot of people in the industry

144
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,860
that we're selling pen testing services

145
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,560
but ultimately was nothing more than a

146
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,390
phone scam and so you know vulnerability

147
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,630
scanning is just typically that

148
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:07,308
automated process of scanning against a

149
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,129
database of known

150
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:13,219
vulnerabilities well I'm going back to

151
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:14,659
purple teaming you know hopefully at

152
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:16,729
some point industry we can settle on a

153
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:17,989
term and everyone will know ok this is

154
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:19,818
exactly what purple teaming is or

155
00:06:17,989 --> 00:06:24,709
control tuning whatever we want to call

156
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:26,599
it with the benefits you know there are

157
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:28,849
so many benefits when it comes to purple

158
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:30,349
teaming and just to name a few you know

159
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:33,649
there's an immediate benefit we're just

160
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:37,248
sitting down as one team you're no

161
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:38,539
longer working in a silo anymore and

162
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:40,459
it's no longer about winning or losing

163
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:42,729
right it's about getting better it's

164
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:46,459
about increasing your capabilities your

165
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:48,289
your creativity and having that that

166
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:50,269
common goal can break down those

167
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:54,649
barriers and make your testing much more

168
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:57,049
effective it allows you to carry out

169
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:58,969
attacks in real time which is great

170
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:00,409
right because now the blue team has

171
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:02,299
visibility into how the red team

172
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:04,369
operates so there's that transparency

173
00:07:02,299 --> 00:07:07,599
factor there that you don't get with a

174
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:10,159
lot of other types of security testing

175
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,919
it's more of an active approach when it

176
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:14,959
comes to implementing tactical fixes and

177
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:17,448
it facilitates the sharing of info by

178
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:20,149
creating that constant feedback channel

179
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:23,749
between the teams to continuously

180
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:26,199
improve security controls and it also

181
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:30,769
assists in evaluating your long-term

182
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:32,719
security goals and strategy now all

183
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:35,149
these different sorts of testing play an

184
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:37,219
important role right they're all key but

185
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:39,229
it's important to where in your overall

186
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:41,629
strategy to use them there's gonna be

187
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:44,089
times when purple team may not be the

188
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:47,349
most appropriate testing perhaps you go

189
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:49,459
red teaming or you do pen testing so

190
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:50,659
while purple teaming is extremely

191
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:54,079
important and I think every company

192
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:55,759
should do it at some point keep in mind

193
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,910
what the overall goal is because it may

194
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:02,530
not be the best approach

195
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:05,440
you know at that time so let's talk

196
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:07,900
about some considerations so with

197
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,180
resources right staff is a big one now

198
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,280
I've seen a very successful global team

199
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,740
engagement with just one member of the

200
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,690
blue and one member of the red I think

201
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,820
it comes down to more of like a maturity

202
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:20,800
right now when I say maturity I'm not

203
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:24,460
talking about an extremely mature

204
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,020
organization right when I say mature I'm

205
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,820
kind of pushing towards the at least

206
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,330
you're patching maybe some basic

207
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,950
scanning some sort of monitoring now

208
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:35,650
even if it's just basic monitoring you

209
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,910
can leverage purple teaming to build out

210
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,709
that monitoring right so if you're

211
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,900
looking at standing up some sort of sim

212
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,160
yeah use purple teaming right to do that

213
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,199
because then you can make sure that as

214
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:50,010
you implement this that you're looking

215
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:52,270
at the right stuff so with the frequency

216
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,830
how often to test there's a lot of

217
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,600
variables that feed into that right and

218
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:59,470
again it's dependent upon your

219
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,630
organization you know do you test when

220
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,970
you get that new appliance or when

221
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:05,170
something big changes in the network or

222
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,850
perhaps you're looking at just doing it

223
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:11,339
more of a consistent basis right here do

224
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,340
it monthly quarterly semi-annually

225
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,839
business is always a big one right like

226
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,880
any a big key to success like any

227
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:22,840
security effort is getting that buy-in

228
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,300
from the business if you can take your

229
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,300
purple teaming efforts and alignment of

230
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,290
some sort of business goal or objective

231
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,890
you're gonna set yourself up for success

232
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:34,900
right away and again I think that from

233
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:37,600
what I've seen you know getting

234
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:42,120
obviously the business on board early on

235
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:45,490
is is gonna be a big key to success and

236
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,620
then lastly just reporting it's very

237
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,170
easy to in most cases to write a

238
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,940
technical report right you go in and as

239
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,689
a pen tester you know our red teamer you

240
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,030
go any start kicking stuff down

241
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,220
and you write a technical report that

242
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:00,920
outlines here's all the stuff we broke

243
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,380
you know here's some recommendations for

244
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,729
remediation and you followed up with a

245
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,830
whole bunch of screenshots of like

246
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,170
chills and whatnot

247
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:11,780
the problem is yeah it's you got those

248
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,250
recommendations in there and you know

249
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,390
management can consume that and give it

250
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:18,740
to the appropriate teams and hopefully

251
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:20,689
that takes place but if you can tell the

252
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,340
business you know or your management why

253
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,990
it matters what the testing you did

254
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,420
again that's gonna set you up for

255
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:29,210
success one of the examples I like to

256
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:33,020
use is exfiltration you know it's very

257
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:34,400
easy to to go in and say hey we we kick

258
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,740
some stuff down we took some data we

259
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,150
took it out of your organization

260
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,460
everybody knows that's a bad thing right

261
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:43,459
you know nobody wants their data taken

262
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:45,860
out of an organization however if you

263
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,510
can say why it matters to the business

264
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,100
right taking that data out of the

265
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,500
organization can have a detrimental

266
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,700
effect on your brand reputation that's

267
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,980
the kind of stuff that's gonna resonate

268
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,530
with management you know with IT

269
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,120
leadership so making sure you do that at

270
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:01,819
some point and report you know the

271
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:09,200
executive summary is again gonna set you

272
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:10,550
up for success so where to start is one

273
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,910
of the biggest challenges that I faced

274
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:17,060
right do you start by reviewing old pen

275
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:18,230
tests you know perhaps some audits you

276
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,719
go through and look at audits and you

277
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:23,720
look for themes or you know just big

278
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,000
gaps and you start there do you start

279
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,030
with a big noisy port scan across the

280
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,950
organization you know if you decide to

281
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:33,500
go that route what network segments do

282
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:36,260
you start with you know the DMZ the

283
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,670
server segment the end user segment

284
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,170
these are all things that can be a

285
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:42,740
challenge and things that you also have

286
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:44,390
to consider and the problem with that

287
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,450
approach is there some structure missing

288
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:49,189
in some cases right so you can do that

289
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,450
you can say oK we've we went through and

290
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,720
tested a lot of these gaps that we

291
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:55,760
exposed from previous pen tests how do

292
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,840
you measure that in a grand scale how do

293
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,930
you make sure that you have appropriate

294
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,740
coverage during your testing so coverage

295
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,729
that's a big one

296
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:06,680
ensure that your testing has adequate

297
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:08,880
coverage that's a big one with tracking

298
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,388
there's a lot of great software out

299
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,310
there right for for teams to collaborate

300
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:17,670
when I say tracking it's more of giving

301
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:19,709
the teams to communicate right get the

302
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:23,069
blue and the red to come together to

303
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:24,750
create those test cases to track any

304
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:26,219
sort of remediation efforts to expose

305
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,970
those gaps and make sure they're

306
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:34,019
actually being worked on and then lastly

307
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:36,180
measuring success when you look at like

308
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,610
a red team engagement again a lot of

309
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,399
times in red teams one of the goals is

310
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:45,269
to test the response of the Security

311
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,569
Operations Center so way in a test like

312
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:48,209
that

313
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:50,519
there's metrics such as time to detect

314
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:52,199
time to remediate and a lot of those I

315
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,079
mean that's solid easy numbers to pull

316
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:57,089
right purple teaming a little bit

317
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:59,189
different but here's how we tackle each

318
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:01,050
of these challenges so where to start

319
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,240
you know get the business need you know

320
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,649
what's the business risk appetite you

321
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,360
know and then feed that kind of into

322
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:08,959
something like a mitre attack

323
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,550
I'll get much more depth on what this is

324
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,649
but it's an excellent place to start and

325
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:19,639
I'll show you why in a bit it's also

326
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:23,009
excellent for measuring coverage and

327
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:24,209
then tracking again it's it's more about

328
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:25,620
just making sure the teams can

329
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:28,800
collaborate right the blue team and the

330
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:31,439
red team bold to have input into into

331
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,258
what you're testing and they're

332
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:35,670
measuring success attack complexity I'll

333
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:37,860
go more into detail on what that looks

334
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:42,029
like and how that works but for this

335
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,649
example it's just attacking velocity now

336
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,980
that I said mitre quite a few times

337
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:47,360
let's go and talk about mitre for a bit

338
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,970
so mitre

339
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,769
was founded in 1958 as a systems

340
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,160
engineering company working on national

341
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:57,240
defense issues we've added numerous

342
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,149
technical and organizational

343
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,880
capabilities over the years and they're

344
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:04,110
dedicated to solving problems right

345
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,850
they're maintained errs of the common

346
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,200
vulnerabilities and exposures which is

347
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,940
CVE which is a database of known

348
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,250
information security vulnerabilities

349
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,529
they also maintain the common weakness

350
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,360
in enumeration system which is a

351
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:19,750
category for software weaknesses and

352
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,450
vulnerabilities now because mitre

353
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,850
actually runs a lot of this stuff they

354
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:27,070
had excellent insight into what these

355
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:29,529
attacks look like and it puts them in a

356
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:33,389
perfect position to take all this stuff

357
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:33,389
in create something is awesome as a tack

358
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,970
so this is mitre attack it stands for

359
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,370
adversarial tactics techniques and

360
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:45,550
common knowledge so that's what the

361
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:49,060
attack fast worm but it's a knowledge

362
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:52,839
base of adversarial actions across their

363
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:55,750
life cycle so think of like apts in the

364
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:58,269
wild think of of real attackers using

365
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,459
real tools you're no longer looking at

366
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:01,870
indicators of compromise you're actually

367
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:06,310
looking at the behaviors of these

368
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:08,589
adversaries and that's huge right they

369
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,569
also have three matrices they got pre

370
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:13,000
attack which sets to the left of

371
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:17,130
delivery and exploit that contains

372
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,079
tactics such as I can do this here

373
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:21,880
target selection people information

374
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,060
gathering organizational information

375
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,040
gathering adversary OPSEC so think of

376
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,569
like a lot of your OSINT stuff that's

377
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,730
what you're gonna see when you're

378
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,860
looking at the pre attack matrix then

379
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,709
you have the enterprise one which covers

380
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:38,620
the initial access and exploitation and

381
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:43,449
then lastly you have mobile which covers

382
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:46,140
mobile devices so if you look at that

383
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:49,990
dark gray bar along the top they're

384
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:52,449
delivering those are the tactics now

385
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:55,180
there's 12 tactics those are the why

386
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:57,040
it's the adversaries tactical objective

387
00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:00,269
it's the reason for performing that

388
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:04,360
action now under those 12 tactics are

389
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:05,740
314 different techniques now this is

390
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,220
obviously the enterprise one it's kind

391
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:11,920
of cut off but out of the 314 techniques

392
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,389
they're not all unique you're gonna have

393
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,260
some techniques they're gonna span

394
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,260
multiple tactics

395
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:20,479
and it gets better within that you have

396
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,090
the procedures so now we got the tactics

397
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,070
techniques and now we got the procedures

398
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:28,640
the procedures are the exact way an

399
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:31,850
adversary carries out or implements

400
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:34,490
those techniques and they're found in

401
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:36,410
the example section of each of those now

402
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:39,320
those numbers were accurate as of April

403
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,280
when I created this mitre seems to do a

404
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,410
lot of their updates I think on a

405
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,209
quarterly basis so this one does include

406
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,860
the impact tactic which is one of the

407
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:48,310
the big things that they added which is

408
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:51,740
I've got some really good stuff in it

409
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:53,930
but this is great for for tracking

410
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,690
efforts right to ensure that you have

411
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:59,270
adequate coverage as well as your depth

412
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:01,940
of coverage you can track this and

413
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:03,319
things like Excel a lot of people done a

414
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,780
lot of really cool things with Excel

415
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:09,800
pulling miter into it the other option

416
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:12,470
is navigator navigator uses nodejs

417
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,030
an angular Co line towards the end of

418
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,670
the presentation I actually have a

419
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,810
screen shot of what note looks like and

420
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,450
I'll kind of walk through or not note

421
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:22,220
I'm sorry Navigator some of the cool

422
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:25,880
things that they they have built into

423
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,650
that but one of the biggest things I

424
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,500
think with mitre is it provides a common

425
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:32,600
language right it's the TTP s are

426
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,280
comparable across different types of

427
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,010
adversary groups using the same

428
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,440
terminology that's really big for the

429
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,360
information security community right now

430
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,920
we have that common language where not

431
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,169
only can we speak within our own

432
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,970
security groups but now we can actually

433
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,770
reach out to other people with an IE

434
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,600
even within the business in some cases

435
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,310
right and so having that common

436
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:58,790
languages I think is a really big thing

437
00:17:52,310 --> 00:18:01,070
that that attack brings to the table so

438
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:04,280
this is just another kind of view of

439
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:07,070
enterprise the framework so you can see

440
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:09,170
we have the 12 tactics there and in the

441
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:12,320
parentheses are how many techniques are

442
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:14,780
available for each of those tactics the

443
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,840
stuff on the left happens earlier so the

444
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:20,090
things like the initial access and

445
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:25,199
execution then it ultimately ends up at

446
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:27,399
command and control exploration and then

447
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,299
so each technique does contain a

448
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:32,799
write-up on mitigation and detection so

449
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:34,389
again that is huge think about it going

450
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,039
into any kind of engagement especially a

451
00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:38,678
purple team engagement when you can sit

452
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:40,929
down with the defenders and say here's

453
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:42,389
the techniques we're gonna go over they

454
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:44,250
can actually go in and look at

455
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:46,418
mitigation and detection strategies

456
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,980
that's like a head start right they can

457
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:50,379
now say you know if we key in on this

458
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,460
one system long event you know or

459
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,289
whatever it would be right they can

460
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,960
start doing this and pulling this in and

461
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:59,049
immediately benefiting the organization

462
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,519
by increasing the security posture the

463
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:02,529
one thing I like to call out on this is

464
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:04,330
and the reason kind of putting the slide

465
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:06,879
together is if you look at defense

466
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:09,250
evasion there's 67 techniques in our

467
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:11,590
defense evasion that in itself kind of

468
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,480
tells a great story right why would

469
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,769
there be that many under you know one of

470
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,620
those techniques but one of those

471
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:20,320
tactics it's because companies are

472
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:22,658
adopting better detection and protection

473
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,960
technologies forcing attackers to get

474
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:28,090
more creative and how they conduct

475
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:36,279
defense evasion so that's kind of a cool

476
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:40,928
thing to call out so let's talk about an

477
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:42,190
approach so obviously identified the

478
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,870
team members you know that's gonna be

479
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:47,740
the first key now again you don't have

480
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:50,729
to have a big purple team right now the

481
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:53,080
more members you can kind of bring in

482
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:55,389
it's kind of a it's a balancing act

483
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,158
right you could get too many but if you

484
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:58,269
can find the fine line of bringing just

485
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:01,090
the right amount right because you're

486
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:02,320
going to add to the creativity right

487
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,000
you're gonna bring people's knowledge

488
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,090
you know from different areas and bring

489
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,929
that together to create those test cases

490
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:10,750
if you're not that big of an

491
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:12,309
organization but you do have a red team

492
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,110
and blue team start with just one of

493
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:18,779
each so again I've seen a lot of

494
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:21,100
successes in that approach and then

495
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:24,879
choose a tactic or adversaries so the

496
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:27,009
reason I have tactic or adversary say

497
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:30,250
you're an organization that's very vocal

498
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:32,769
right on your political stance or say

499
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:35,310
just by the nature of what your company

500
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:37,590
does you draw on a lot of

501
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:41,010
apt groups right you know China or

502
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:45,830
Russia or whatever would be perhaps you

503
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,830
focus more on looking at the adversary

504
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,650
miters put together some really great

505
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,690
adversary emulation plans that you can

506
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:54,900
use to kind of test off of that they

507
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:57,150
also have a really cool page where you

508
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,550
can put in groups and put in what your

509
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:01,680
your organization does right by sector

510
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,940
you could put in travel or banking and

511
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,920
it will actually tell you what groups

512
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,060
are targeting you

513
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,160
however like a lot of organizations

514
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:10,379
perhaps you're getting attacked from all

515
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,050
kinds of people all the time that's

516
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:16,380
where I would say focus on a tactic at a

517
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:19,080
time one tactic do your tests and then

518
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,790
report off of that tactic moving forward

519
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,830
through rest of the presentation I'm

520
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:24,840
just gonna focus on a tactic instead of

521
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:27,000
an adversary group but keep in mind

522
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,560
though that you can't do it by adversary

523
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,960
group which will outline the different

524
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,960
techniques within the tactics geo test

525
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:42,419
so create the test cases and execute so

526
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:44,490
again it's it's crucial that that both

527
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,080
teams contribute right the red team is

528
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,730
gonna have what they think would be

529
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,320
excellent test cases they're gonna go

530
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,330
and create this stuff and say here's how

531
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,280
I'm going to attack this the blue team

532
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,689
is gonna have just as good of knowledge

533
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,730
right because they know what tools

534
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:59,310
they're looking at they know some gaps

535
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,600
that may exist and so making sure that

536
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:03,300
they go through and actually contribute

537
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,070
and create those test cases is vital

538
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:10,020
it's very important for the success of a

539
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:11,879
good purple team program now execute so

540
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:15,480
this is an example of what it could look

541
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,880
like we kind of meet we say we're gonna

542
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,550
focus on this tactic you know for for

543
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,680
next month so you create the spreadsheet

544
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:25,110
in someplace where everybody can can you

545
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,880
know contribute and you start throwing

546
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,040
out test cases you know you go through

547
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,360
each of the techniques in that tactic

548
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:34,250
and you start creating test cases and

549
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,290
that way on the day of the engagement

550
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:39,580
you go over typically the red team

551
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:41,440
members you know the pen testers

552
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,289
over and set with the folks at the

553
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,200
Security Operations Center plug in their

554
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:49,809
laptop and say here's a Destin or the

555
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,399
source IP of the attacking machine right

556
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:53,289
you're communicating all this out to the

557
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:55,299
defenders you're saying here's the

558
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:58,419
target I'm going after we're gonna start

559
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:59,710
with test case number one execute you do

560
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,999
that you have the blue team sitting

561
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,489
there looking at all their different

562
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:05,019
tools right as that attacks happening

563
00:23:03,489 --> 00:23:07,239
they just they're seeing this real-time

564
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:09,009
they're saying okay I see I see it in

565
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:10,749
the firewall logs I see it in the system

566
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:15,639
logs however over here we lose

567
00:23:10,749 --> 00:23:16,960
visibility so you can stop the test see

568
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:18,459
if you can implement a quick tactical

569
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,789
fix it can be something very small and

570
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,980
easy it could just be you know quick

571
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:26,139
change and your sim right to pull that

572
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:31,989
information in to start getting logging

573
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:34,299
and alerting around that but identifying

574
00:23:31,989 --> 00:23:38,759
the small gaps retesting and remediating

575
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:42,279
I think is important report and present

576
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:43,629
so reporting we all know how important

577
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:46,029
reporting is and any kind of security

578
00:23:43,629 --> 00:23:48,340
testing the report is the ultimate

579
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:49,840
deliverable not many people like doing

580
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:53,619
reports but we all know how valuable

581
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,820
they are and so you put all this time

582
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:57,369
and effort right and creating a great

583
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:59,200
report the reason I put present on there

584
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:02,379
is if you have the opportunity to

585
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,049
present to management take it and one of

586
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:06,309
the biggest reasons why is if you write

587
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:08,529
the report you sent out to management

588
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:09,999
they may just read it and they make it

589
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:12,580
out to the necessary parties and be like

590
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:14,830
ok cool whatever but if you have the

591
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,330
opportunity to present you'll be able to

592
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:18,549
get feedback from them to make sure that

593
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,989
what your your actions or what you're

594
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:21,549
doing around purple teaming aligns with

595
00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:24,759
kind of what they have in their mind and

596
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:26,350
so that could be a good indicator of do

597
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:28,840
I need to change my approach you know

598
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:30,009
are they looking at testing all the

599
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,809
techniques and atactic you know this

600
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:36,759
isn't too much for them to consume and

601
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:38,408
so again if you have the ability to go

602
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:39,419
present to management I would definitely

603
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:43,050
recommend it

604
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:44,970
remediating are gaps in retest

605
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:47,070
the big thing here is don't stop at the

606
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,350
larger gaps it's bound to happen as

607
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:51,419
you're going through your test cases

608
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:53,370
that you'll uncover some small gaps

609
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:55,320
you'd be able to fix them on the fly and

610
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:57,149
retest right then and there and then

611
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,100
realize Wow now we have visibility and

612
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:01,290
something that we didn't know if you

613
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,820
look at like red teaming a traditional

614
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,590
pen testing right that process can take

615
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,320
months right because the testing happens

616
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:08,520
and then the report goes to where it

617
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,110
used to go and then it eventually comes

618
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,460
to the blue team who will probably have

619
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,290
questions on exactly how that was

620
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,030
carried out with purple team you know

621
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:18,420
it's it's right there there's that

622
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:20,820
transparency with the larger gaps when

623
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:23,610
you uncover those document on report on

624
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,750
them keep moving right if you can keep

625
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:28,399
going through the rest of the techniques

626
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:30,660
and that tactic then do it if you can't

627
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,180
report on it and move to the next tactic

628
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,290
if you stop it those larger gaps it's

629
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,900
gonna kill your momentum right

630
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:38,700
especially in pretty much any size

631
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,110
organization when you uncover something

632
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,730
big there's gonna be some time to fix

633
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:44,280
that if you can keep moving forward your

634
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:48,420
testing then I think momentum again is

635
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:51,660
either and then increase your attack

636
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:53,970
complexity so as successful testing

637
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:58,200
occurs your attack complexity increases

638
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:59,190
it's that simple now as you're going

639
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,990
through and doing all this you're

640
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:03,240
building out a heat map right it's kind

641
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:05,820
of showing like what your coverage and

642
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:09,330
your capabilities look like and and

643
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:11,909
against your controls and I just when I

644
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:13,889
call or automate so if anyone's looked

645
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:16,020
at mitre they might have seen some stuff

646
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:19,200
or mitre attack you might have see some

647
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:20,970
stuff around automate so there's some

648
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,220
really awesome tools being developed

649
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,990
you have caldera you have Red Team

650
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,990
automation you have atomic Red Team

651
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:29,760
these are all great open source tools

652
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:32,640
that you can leverage to automate some

653
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,920
of this early on if you might just build

654
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,790
automated a lower attack complexity

655
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:40,260
however you know each of these tools do

656
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:43,080
have the caveat so just like any

657
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:44,640
security tool ensure that you properly

658
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,080
vet it and make sure that it makes sense

659
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,080
in your organization

660
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:54,860
so measuring success so attack

661
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,090
complexity right we're not looking at

662
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,010
time to detect in time to remediate

663
00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:00,439
because when you're sitting down is one

664
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:02,120
team with one goal of improving security

665
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,680
posture you're not measuring the shock

666
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,719
response anymore you're sitting down

667
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,850
saying let's go through and see what we

668
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,160
can fix on a low level and then how when

669
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:12,909
we increase our attack complexity in

670
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,960
this example I have five levels defined

671
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:17,420
perhaps for your organization it make

672
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,680
sense to have three or ten so again it

673
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,620
really just depends on how you want to

674
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:24,080
define these but again as successful

675
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:28,610
testing occurs your attack complexity

676
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:31,040
increases so if you look at the first

677
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:33,409
one right it's it's using tools out of

678
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,920
the box with no modification it's

679
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:38,750
running port scans being as long as

680
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,810
possible right it's the the goal with

681
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:43,910
complexity one is to be noisy be seen

682
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:46,100
right because if you can't be seen with

683
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:47,720
the most basic stuff why try getting all

684
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,810
elite and doing all the crazy cool stuff

685
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:54,560
so again be as long as you can be noisy

686
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:56,750
and be seen if you look at the second

687
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,240
one looking at like slight modifications

688
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:01,250
of attacking tools so maybe some slight

689
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,480
throttling changing a default ports

690
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:05,540
right that's a big one for the second

691
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,880
one jumping down to complexity for we're

692
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:09,860
looking at actually combining techniques

693
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:13,420
from other tactics to create our test

694
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:15,709
cases now if you're testing per tactic

695
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:17,300
you can still grab techniques from other

696
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,100
ones right as you're testing that one

697
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,210
and you almost have to when you get to

698
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,860
those higher attack complexities

699
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:24,560
depending on how you define it but in

700
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:27,439
this example you would have to and then

701
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:30,280
going down to five extraordinary efforts

702
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,200
are made to bypass all security controls

703
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:35,480
now if you look at this it's extremely

704
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,480
loosely defined and it's like that for a

705
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:42,650
reason there's lots of room to continue

706
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,750
to build out build this whole thing out

707
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:48,050
each time you test a technique because

708
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:50,810
each technique tested has the potential

709
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:52,500
to fine tune that definition if you

710
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:54,810
define these early on

711
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,940
a very granular level there's a change

712
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:58,740
you may have to not add to it but

713
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,080
actually change it and if you're

714
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,270
changing it you're kind of roading the

715
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,340
benefit of a framework right and so I

716
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:06,870
think it's very key to at a very high

717
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,520
level to find these and as you're going

718
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,260
through your testing you might find ways

719
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,780
to kind of fine-tune that as you go

720
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,820
through it and again one approach would

721
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:17,340
be you know out of those 12 tactics

722
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,689
we're gonna focus on a tactic at attack

723
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,370
complexity one and go through and do all

724
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,500
of them if you're a very mature

725
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:24,149
organization perhaps you can do one

726
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:29,370
tactic at complexity levels one and two

727
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:32,760
right so let's go through just an

728
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:35,149
example with a test case so in this

729
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:39,450
example we're gonna focus on

730
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:41,540
exfiltration now exultation has nine

731
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:44,880
different tact or techniques

732
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:47,460
now remember when I said where to start

733
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,840
is kind of the challenge so say you're

734
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,370
like okay we know we want to start with

735
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,270
we wanna start with MITRE right because

736
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:54,090
there's some really cool things with

737
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:57,420
mitre attack but you still have the 12

738
00:29:54,090 --> 00:30:00,330
tactics with 314 techniques so where do

739
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:02,580
you start well this is one approach so

740
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:05,370
if you look at the cyber kill chain

741
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:08,820
right that far end is the actions on

742
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:11,669
objective objectives some of the items

743
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:14,879
in their command-and-control data

744
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:16,980
exfiltration so when you think about it

745
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,200
anybody that's been to like a sands or

746
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,480
any other conferences there's all this

747
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,770
talk on assume breach right where you

748
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,080
assume that someone's on your network

749
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:28,950
and and now you're just trying to find

750
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,210
them so a lot of red teams as well

751
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:33,000
that's how they operate you know

752
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:35,520
everybody in here knows that to get that

753
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,640
foothold just need a really well-crafted

754
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,110
phishing email now you can spend your

755
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,690
cycles going through the whole exercise

756
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:45,040
of trying to create that and establish a

757
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:47,290
foothold that is one approach

758
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,920
but if you want to sing breech start

759
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:52,149
with that far right side which would be

760
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:56,830
exfiltration or impact or command and

761
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:58,870
control the other one would be starting

762
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:00,250
way left right that pre-attack so if you

763
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,439
want to just see what your company is

764
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:06,280
exposed to on the outside world you

765
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,690
could start with the ocean stuff but in

766
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,420
this example here's some example test

767
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:12,160
cases so what's unique about the

768
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:15,400
exfiltration tactic is the fifth

769
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:18,130
technique down is exfiltration over

770
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:20,470
alternative protocol so what we did here

771
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,570
is in this example we decided to pick a

772
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:25,120
protocol there's four listed in there

773
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:27,520
right so we pick a protocol we combine

774
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,610
it with another technique to create that

775
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:33,490
test case now if you're testing against

776
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:36,010
say a data loss prevention suite of

777
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:37,750
tools perhaps you call it a data type

778
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,010
right so do you want to test what it

779
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,810
looks like when credit cards leaving

780
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:44,170
your network or just the general PII or

781
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:47,050
pH I'm so in this example what we did is

782
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:48,490
we created you know we said FTP over

783
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:50,379
standard port remember this is a

784
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:52,570
complexity one so we're looking at

785
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:54,910
keeping a standard port we're looking at

786
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:56,590
being very noisy and we're just gonna do

787
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,760
data compressed we've run through that

788
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,399
test case and see what that looks like

789
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,350
you notice the blue team see it or not

790
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,970
when you look at the second test case we

791
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,409
add in a couple of other techniques not

792
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:07,120
to make it harder but just to test those

793
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:09,400
and make sure that whatever we're seeing

794
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,070
is consistent but you see we have

795
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,320
automated exfiltration as well as data

796
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:16,629
transfer size limits and on both of

797
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,360
those we call out consistent size and

798
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,680
consistent timing the reason is you know

799
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,379
how many attackers are consistent

800
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:26,020
through that stuff maybe some a lot

801
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:27,610
probably aren't however if you start

802
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,379
again getting all leet and trying to

803
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:32,110
make these attacks very complex all

804
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:34,510
you're gonna end up doing is having a

805
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:36,310
huge laundry list of remediation items

806
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,650
to go after that's gonna cure your

807
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:40,270
momentum management's gonna be you know

808
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:42,220
probably second guessing like is this

809
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:45,430
even worth doing you know maybe there's

810
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:47,560
a better approach so if you can again

811
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:49,180
start small start with what you know

812
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,580
right you know that you have logging

813
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:53,040
around something

814
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:54,210
test that great test cases around that

815
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,710
just to make sure that you have that

816
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,900
then you start increasing that attack

817
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:01,050
complexity but you can see we did stuff

818
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:04,230
around on this example HTTP we did stuff

819
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:06,659
on DMS but again the goal with the

820
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:08,460
complexity one is just be loud you know

821
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,860
drop the hammer and without bringing

822
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:14,370
stuff down a production of course but

823
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:16,679
just be loud and be seen you can see

824
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:19,260
this last technique here is just an

825
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,910
example of one that doesn't require

826
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,040
adding a port right it's just plugging

827
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,210
the USB Drive in to a machine and seeing

828
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,790
what that looks like is you're trying to

829
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,550
export rate data now when I said in some

830
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:31,200
cases you can go through and if you're

831
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:32,460
you know a more mature organization

832
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,860
perhaps you can do something as simple

833
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,570
as hey I'm trying to do this FTP stuff

834
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:38,070
however I just can't connect out over

835
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,179
FTP perhaps there's some sort of

836
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,610
security group or there's something

837
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:43,530
blocking you how easy would it be to

838
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:44,129
just changed on port number and then see

839
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,810
if it works

840
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:47,490
now you're the complexity to you track

841
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,480
that a whole different heat map so

842
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:51,600
that's an example of something it's very

843
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,530
easy to go after and tap and say okay

844
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,360
well we could do it over a different

845
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:56,970
port well let's see what that looks like

846
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,649
how can we find indicators on what we

847
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:00,750
can do to get logging and alerting

848
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:08,340
around that to build out your

849
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:11,730
capabilities right so let's jump to a

850
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:14,820
complexity for now this one is gonna be

851
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:18,000
over credential access and credential

852
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:19,169
access has 19 different techniques the

853
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,540
thing that's interesting with credential

854
00:34:19,168 --> 00:34:22,918
access and one of the caveats of taking

855
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,870
this approach I'm laying out is if you

856
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:25,560
start at that far right side of

857
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:27,889
exfiltration

858
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,600
you're gonna hit credential access

859
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:33,239
before we hit privilege escalation and

860
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,770
that can be a problem right because just

861
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:38,100
about every single technique under

862
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:42,509
credential access requires an admin or

863
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:45,989
local or admin or you know like root

864
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:47,100
access or system level access how do you

865
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:48,810
do that if you haven't even been to the

866
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:51,900
credential or the Crillon escalation

867
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:55,080
stuff first well I like to use this

868
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:57,300
example so as a pen tester

869
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:59,400
a developer reaches on says hey can you

870
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:02,760
hand test my web application make sure

871
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,710
they give me a URL and during the

872
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,910
information gathering stage I uncovered

873
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:09,030
that it's behind a web application

874
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:11,460
firewall the first thing I do is I reach

875
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:14,070
back out and say can you whitelist me on

876
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,210
the firewall a lot of people throw their

877
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,710
hands up and say man you're making me

878
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:19,350
drop my defenses like how fair is that

879
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:21,390
right the thing to keep in mind is I'm

880
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:23,310
not looking to test the efficacy of the

881
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,930
laughs right all controls can fail at

882
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,670
some point right so let's assume that

883
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:28,799
all the control spilled I can get all

884
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:31,500
the way back there my goal is to test

885
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,450
the web application itself so I'm

886
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,580
testing the web app whitelisted on the

887
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:37,560
firewall and I uncover say five

888
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:40,950
exploitable vulnerabilities that are all

889
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,690
high risk now bring up the laughs now

890
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:44,669
none of them work well what was a high

891
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,470
risk is now a medium maybe even a low

892
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:49,110
that's where pain testing will come in

893
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:51,450
the reason I say throw all that out

894
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:53,910
there is with credential access give the

895
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:55,140
test you're in an easy way to escalate

896
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:57,029
you don't want them spinning their

897
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,980
wheels trying to do privilege escalation

898
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:01,320
or an endpoint to eventually get to this

899
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,610
point give it to them so they can get

900
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,880
through the testing and then drop it

901
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:09,090
let's assume that the attacker somehow

902
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,710
escalated privileges and I was able to

903
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,730
get to this point you want your

904
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,650
defenders to be able to see what that

905
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:16,080
looks like in the logs now when you're

906
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:17,250
the complexity for you may not even be

907
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,380
able to do you know if you did

908
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,550
complexity for across the board you

909
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,770
might be at a point on that privilege

910
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:23,880
escalation tactic to realize that man

911
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:26,130
we're just we're kind of running out of

912
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,950
stuff that's where it's key to so as you

913
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:30,330
increase that testing make it you know

914
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,460
easy for the tester to go through and

915
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,990
just just elevate those because you have

916
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,610
a tactic around privilege escalation

917
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,049
that's we're gonna spin your cycles

918
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,360
trying to figure out how can I actually

919
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:41,460
do this so if you start from the far

920
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:44,550
right at impact or exfiltration keep

921
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:48,060
that in mind when you get over to the

922
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:51,900
credential access tactic so looking at

923
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:54,509
some test cases here so this first one

924
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:58,470
account manipulation so when I set it

925
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:59,760
complexity for you're pulling techniques

926
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:01,080
for different tactics so that's kind of

927
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,770
where it becomes key but if you look at

928
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,560
account manipulation they call this a

929
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:07,990
multi tactic

930
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,759
it spans two different techniques it

931
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:12,640
spans persistence as well as credential

932
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,650
access so again here we're just saying

933
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,839
at a compromised account to a local

934
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:20,230
alignment group and game persistence so

935
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:23,080
with credential dumping if you look here

936
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:25,060
we're saying you know leverage of proof

937
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,290
soccer to dump credentials exfiltrating

938
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,150
attempt to recover plain text right

939
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,860
that's a lot of stuff right there but

940
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:32,170
again we're too complexity for we want

941
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:34,450
that visibility if you look at the

942
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:37,060
credential dumping technique there is a

943
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:38,560
whole lot of stuff in there a lot of

944
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:41,320
different tools you could use right if

945
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,880
you have a decent endpoint or antivirus

946
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,430
solution because some of them actually

947
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,770
do exist right those tools gonna get

948
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,490
ripped up real quick

949
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:49,930
but there's some stuff in there that

950
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:51,580
could be approved such as you know

951
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:53,740
sysinternals maybe you allow

952
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:55,810
sysinternals within that is a tool

953
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:57,779
called proc dump you can leverage proc

954
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:59,950
dump do then go dump your credentials

955
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:02,050
allowing the tester to say hey this is

956
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:04,960
what this looks like using an approved

957
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:06,790
tool not seen you have to blacklist that

958
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,110
however let's build logging or learning

959
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,610
around what that looks like so if

960
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:11,590
someone does use proc dump in that

961
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:12,790
manner we have that visibility we can

962
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:16,810
alert on it and to figure out what's

963
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:18,610
going on if you look at hooking so this

964
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:20,590
is a technique that actually spans three

965
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:23,520
different tactics persistence privilege

966
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:25,870
escalation as well as credential access

967
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,910
and this one is locate a tool that

968
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:30,040
bypasses antivirus and executed test

969
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:34,120
script within the context of another

970
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:36,970
process looking at bash history we don't

971
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,380
have a test case there and I did this

972
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:40,779
for a reason there's gonna be times

973
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:42,400
where as you're going through different

974
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:44,170
attack complexities you're gonna realize

975
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,920
that every technique may not be

976
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:48,820
applicable if you look at bash history

977
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,910
there's not a whole lot in there right

978
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:53,140
it's a fairly simple technique so you

979
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:55,600
may only be able to test it at a

980
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,930
complexity one but beyond that there's

981
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,430
not much you can do but I caution you

982
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:04,509
don't write bash history off you know as

983
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:05,440
you create say something in node right

984
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,240
you're looking at your coverage map

985
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,580
don't just remove bash history when you

986
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:11,200
get to a complexity two and higher the

987
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,170
reason being is again when you get to

988
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,399
complexity four and five

989
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:16,470
- history might be something that you

990
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,359
chain along with these other items that

991
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:21,058
maybe were only applicable at a

992
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:22,020
complexity one to build that high you

993
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:23,430
know if anyone's done some web

994
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,319
pentesting that's key right you find

995
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:27,660
some low-risk items that have chained

996
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:30,480
together in a certain way now it becomes

997
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:34,290
a high-risk item so don't write items

998
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:37,410
off if you can't find the right test

999
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:39,380
case for that attack complexity but

1000
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:42,690
going back to hooking so another example

1001
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:46,890
so hooking has one tool that's actually

1002
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:49,109
called out in the in that technique the

1003
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:51,950
tool is called thin fissure and this is

1004
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:54,630
how it's defined it's a government grade

1005
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:57,328
commercial surveillance spyware sold

1006
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:58,859
exclusively to government agencies if

1007
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:00,210
you got that tall great you could

1008
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:02,819
probably test it a complexity one right

1009
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:04,200
but that's an example of you may not be

1010
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:05,430
able to touch the hooking technique

1011
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:10,348
until you get to a higher attack

1012
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:12,419
complexity so there's also cases where

1013
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:14,609
you may have a technique that only has a

1014
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:16,829
complexity one and then you have to jump

1015
00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:18,240
to a five right so keep in mind as

1016
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:19,799
you're going through this you're not

1017
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,109
going to test every technique at every

1018
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:23,700
single attack complexity weight this is

1019
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:29,250
the fine you may find a better way to

1020
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:32,098
define it to where you could do that so

1021
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:35,430
this is a an example of navigator right

1022
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:37,890
navigator is an awesome tool that allows

1023
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:40,558
you to track your progress again you

1024
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:41,940
could do an excel this is a web version

1025
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:43,109
right they got a hosted version that you

1026
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,339
can go through and kind of mess with and

1027
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:45,720
see what it looks like kind of

1028
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:47,970
determined like all the capabilities

1029
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:50,609
what you can leverage what may not work

1030
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:52,259
for you if you're gonna use this to

1031
00:40:50,609 --> 00:40:54,900
track it I highly suggest to pull it

1032
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:59,670
down onto a local system obviously and

1033
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:02,490
back it up and again it uses angular

1034
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:05,490
cl-cl I'm no GS and it writes all the

1035
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:08,578
files up to JSON so again it's going

1036
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:10,439
nice but if you look at the top left we

1037
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:12,809
have a tab there and that tab name is

1038
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,730
called attack complexity one and this

1039
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:17,069
example will eventually have five

1040
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:18,809
different tabs the cool thing is say

1041
00:41:17,069 --> 00:41:20,730
that we went through at a complexity one

1042
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,380
through all the different tactics then

1043
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:24,780
we go over we create a second

1044
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,490
spreadsheet with complexity to do all

1045
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,130
the different tact

1046
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:30,040
you can open up a third tab by combining

1047
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:32,000
the first and second ones and then

1048
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,550
sending the colors however you want into

1049
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,860
an overlay and then that point you can

1050
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:38,300
see okay here's a rat on a one but

1051
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:40,190
here's where a data to look at all the

1052
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:42,650
red on these tactics right here that's

1053
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:44,869
where we need to focus right and that's

1054
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:47,240
where you can build that story around it

1055
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:48,200
present that to management and say no

1056
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,890
this is really where we need to focus

1057
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,240
right

1058
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:52,129
we have great controls through

1059
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,290
complexity one because again with pretty

1060
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:56,000
basic testing but through two we

1061
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:59,660
discovered that there's some stuff here

1062
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,160
we need to focus on if you look in the

1063
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:03,950
the right-hand side you'll see that

1064
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:07,339
little gray bar popped out our box

1065
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:10,399
that's an example of a comment so um

1066
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:12,200
each of these techniques allows you to

1067
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,090
add a comment which is great right

1068
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,189
because this is something that you want

1069
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:19,670
the blue team of Red Team to both come

1070
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:21,619
together and collaborate on so if you

1071
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,940
find a gap you know you can you can

1072
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:24,560
write some stuff in there maybe an

1073
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,030
incident number or something to track it

1074
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,070
to say hey here's kind of where we're at

1075
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:29,990
with remediation and again it's about

1076
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:33,290
transparency between the red and blue

1077
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:35,629
team's if you look in the lower right

1078
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:37,310
hand corner we had the legend the legend

1079
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:41,119
in this case we have three colors

1080
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:44,359
defined we have green which is just

1081
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,980
showing that controls exist right we

1082
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:49,160
have yellow that may be additional

1083
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:52,250
testings needed and then red is gaps

1084
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,920
exist perhaps you had a fourth color in

1085
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:56,570
that's blue and that's where techniques

1086
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,680
that are not applicable right so again

1087
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:59,869
you want to make sure that you're able

1088
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,379
to track everything and not just like a

1089
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:05,570
blank so again and in some cases you

1090
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:08,060
might come up with five colors for your

1091
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:09,410
testing but again as you're doing this

1092
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:11,480
you're looking for those themes right

1093
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:14,000
those those areas where you know you

1094
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,260
have some pretty big gaps and again

1095
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,150
that's how you can go to management and

1096
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:19,400
say hey here's this nice pretty picture

1097
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:20,540
with with all these colors but look at

1098
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,450
all that red that's where you need to

1099
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:29,349
focus and it does give you the insight

1100
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:31,279
into larger gaps so just some takeaways

1101
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:34,699
purple teaming is not a silver bullet

1102
00:43:31,279 --> 00:43:36,109
right so but I think every organization

1103
00:43:34,699 --> 00:43:38,329
should do it right there's a lot of

1104
00:43:36,109 --> 00:43:42,650
really good things too that can come

1105
00:43:38,329 --> 00:43:44,209
about from there you know is it right

1106
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:46,339
for every organization at some point yes

1107
00:43:44,209 --> 00:43:48,078
but again look at what you're looking to

1108
00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:50,719
accomplish look at what your goals are

1109
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,549
and then determine is purple teaming the

1110
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:54,009
best approach at some point it will be

1111
00:43:52,549 --> 00:43:56,150
right

1112
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:57,439
you got to ensure that you're doing some

1113
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,729
of the basics though you know if you

1114
00:43:57,439 --> 00:44:00,859
look at like the the critical security

1115
00:43:58,729 --> 00:44:04,718
controls right you know do your scanning

1116
00:44:00,859 --> 00:44:04,719
make sure you know what you have right

1117
00:44:05,289 --> 00:44:10,459
and based I mean it comes down to like

1118
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:13,459
what makes a successful purple team just

1119
00:44:10,459 --> 00:44:15,288
breaking down that that barrier of

1120
00:44:13,459 --> 00:44:17,808
communication just coming together as a

1121
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:18,949
team with that common goal you know

1122
00:44:17,809 --> 00:44:20,929
sitting there together saying we're

1123
00:44:18,949 --> 00:44:23,179
gonna go do this and and look at that

1124
00:44:20,929 --> 00:44:24,859
our security posture is increasing after

1125
00:44:23,179 --> 00:44:26,419
one afternoon you know some engagements

1126
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:30,799
might spend an afternoon some might be

1127
00:44:26,419 --> 00:44:35,749
in a couple days look at mitre attack

1128
00:44:30,799 --> 00:44:37,749
right even if you have you know you're

1129
00:44:35,749 --> 00:44:40,549
doing purple teaming you already have

1130
00:44:37,749 --> 00:44:42,828
tools in place or some sort of framework

1131
00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:45,079
whatever it is right I would highly

1132
00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:46,909
suggest just look at mitre you know

1133
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:48,229
there's so many awesome things that can

1134
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:50,150
be done with it and in my opinion I

1135
00:44:48,229 --> 00:44:55,279
think it's one of the best things to a

1136
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:57,079
hit industry it's great for a purple

1137
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:58,819
teaming it's great for red teaming it's

1138
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:00,289
great for you know threat intelligence

1139
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:02,119
and you can feed this into a lot of

1140
00:45:00,289 --> 00:45:04,699
things and if you get on their website

1141
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:08,229
they're using it in many different ways

1142
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:08,229
so definitely check that out

1143
00:45:08,749 --> 00:45:12,288
consider the different approaches so

1144
00:45:10,699 --> 00:45:15,409
does it make sense for your organization

1145
00:45:12,289 --> 00:45:17,239
to just start from the far left at the

1146
00:45:15,409 --> 00:45:18,380
pre attack and look at OSA or do you

1147
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:20,359
just want to jump in and see no it let's

1148
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:23,179
just assume breach let's start at that

1149
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:25,369
exfiltration tactic and are the impact

1150
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:26,959
tactic and you know if we can at least

1151
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:28,849
start building up some logging and

1152
00:45:26,959 --> 00:45:30,828
alerting capabilities there you kind of

1153
00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:33,559
started to win right because if you can

1154
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:34,630
deny the attacker the actions on

1155
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:36,039
objective

1156
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:37,269
again you're starting to win at that

1157
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:39,339
point you keep moving back and then

1158
00:45:37,269 --> 00:45:41,258
hopefully hopefully don't uncover

1159
00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:42,250
anything you know or maybe you do if you

1160
00:45:41,259 --> 00:45:45,609
think that you may have actually been

1161
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:48,279
compromised the other thing to consider

1162
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:49,660
is again do you do it by tactic do you

1163
00:45:48,279 --> 00:45:51,190
do it by just a couple techniques and

1164
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,210
then active again it comes down to a lot

1165
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:54,099
of different things right how mature

1166
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:56,049
your organization is the current

1167
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:58,180
capabilities that your your red and blue

1168
00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:59,259
teams have how creative they can be when

1169
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:02,288
they're coming up with these test cases

1170
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:04,420
or perhaps again you start with an

1171
00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:08,440
adversary again you could go to miters

1172
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:09,609
website and go to the group's so if you

1173
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,440
know like you know here's the sector

1174
00:46:09,609 --> 00:46:13,509
we're in I kind of know some people that

1175
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,950
may target us but maybe let's find the

1176
00:46:13,509 --> 00:46:16,630
ones that are actually dedicated to

1177
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:18,279
targeting us

1178
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:22,839
you can get that visibility which is

1179
00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:26,230
nice and then business and reporting are

1180
00:46:22,839 --> 00:46:28,930
key get that buy-in early right if you

1181
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:31,059
can get management buy-in and you can

1182
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:32,980
align your efforts around purple teaming

1183
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:36,579
again you're really setting yourself up

1184
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:38,160
for success at that point and with the

1185
00:46:36,579 --> 00:46:40,420
report I can't stress this enough

1186
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,269
because my management really opened my

1187
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:46,390
eyes up to how important this is but

1188
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:48,578
reporting is key right telling the

1189
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:50,650
business why this matters to them

1190
00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:52,299
because if you don't all they see is

1191
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:54,339
some technical stuff they know they need

1192
00:46:52,299 --> 00:46:56,019
to fix it but how do they prioritize

1193
00:46:54,339 --> 00:46:57,190
that with the other other stuff right

1194
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:59,618
that they may have outlined in their

1195
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:01,569
strategy so make sure you put it in

1196
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:03,519
terms that are friendly with with

1197
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:05,170
business folks because that's what's

1198
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:06,578
gonna resonate that's what gonna

1199
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:10,380
Surprise them and make them open their

1200
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:10,380
eyes and maybe their checkbook you know

1201
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:15,660
so that being said what

1202
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:45,650
but questions do you have there's got to

1203
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:47,419
be a question not one yes yes so the the

1204
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:48,380
question was as we're going to red team

1205
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,180
or blue team

1206
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:54,619
does that determine how much information

1207
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:56,960
gather and we do it does I think that

1208
00:47:54,619 --> 00:48:00,950
again it's more in the approach and what

1209
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:15,140
your end goal is ultimately next

1210
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:16,308
question yes okay so the question was

1211
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:19,279
with attack complexity this is a

1212
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:25,400
technique there he said the TAC the the

1213
00:48:19,279 --> 00:48:27,589
test case okay so if you're taking your

1214
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,299
testing you're approaching it by tactic

1215
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:31,339
then each of those techniques you're

1216
00:48:29,299 --> 00:48:33,710
gonna have at the same test case now in

1217
00:48:31,339 --> 00:48:37,308
some cases you may say that what use

1218
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:40,099
exfiltration is an example you know FTP

1219
00:48:37,309 --> 00:48:41,809
seems pretty locked down right but DNS

1220
00:48:40,099 --> 00:48:43,910
maybe not so much so perhaps as you're

1221
00:48:41,809 --> 00:48:45,410
going through that tactic you outline on

1222
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:47,210
your different test cases but one of the

1223
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:50,240
benefits to purple teaming is on-the-fly

1224
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:53,539
you might say okay our five test cases

1225
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,828
around FTP are not successful right but

1226
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:56,900
let's go through and do some DNS stuff

1227
00:48:54,829 --> 00:48:58,400
and we uncover this you go back to FTP

1228
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,410
and you're like what about a simple port

1229
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,029
change let's see if that works so it's

1230
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:05,149
it's basically depending on the approach

1231
00:49:02,029 --> 00:49:06,440
you take if you do a bye tactic then as

1232
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,539
you ball your test cases you'll do

1233
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,829
whatever attack complex' do you want but

1234
00:49:08,539 --> 00:49:12,529
one approach would be complexity one

1235
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:13,700
across the board and it does depend your

1236
00:49:12,529 --> 00:49:15,650
maturity again if you have a lot of

1237
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,689
controls around some of those techniques

1238
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:19,400
you may hit a wall from the very GetGo

1239
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:21,019
right and then you're like okay I can't

1240
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,549
do anything else that's where that

1241
00:49:21,019 --> 00:49:25,430
creativity comes in right and so

1242
00:49:22,549 --> 00:49:27,140
depending on how knowledgeable your blue

1243
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:28,848
and your red teams are will kind of

1244
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:32,629
determine how fast you can actually move

1245
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:34,930
through the complexity levels next

1246
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:34,930
question

1247
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:41,540
[Music]

1248
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:44,120
okay so the question was how do you

1249
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:45,740
ensure with increasing attack complexity

1250
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,990
or not breaking production that's an

1251
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:49,669
excellent question right so that's where

1252
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:52,040
I think it's very important when both

1253
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:53,240
teams come together right so again the

1254
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,550
red team might say you know I can go

1255
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,979
after this right say your target maybe

1256
00:49:55,550 --> 00:50:00,140
is is is maybe not a business critical

1257
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:02,180
application but it's something and in

1258
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:04,160
dev right but you know ultimately that

1259
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:05,690
the login alerting may look the same and

1260
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,069
so that's a very delicate thing to

1261
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:09,680
manage and that's where I think that

1262
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:11,270
making sure both teams can contribute is

1263
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,000
crucial because then you have that

1264
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:15,200
ability to walk through that weeks or

1265
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,440
even months before you actually do the

1266
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,210
engagement to figure out is this does

1267
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,890
this have the possibility of impacting

1268
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:25,010
the business and so you know just like

1269
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:27,350
any security testing you know it just

1270
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:29,000
depends and and yeah when you get to

1271
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:33,350
those higher tech complexities it does

1272
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,670
increase the risk so perhaps you you

1273
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:36,410
know you pull it more into like a dev

1274
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:37,760
environment you know as long as the same

1275
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:39,680
logging and learning spans across

1276
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:52,010
multiple ones then that would be one

1277
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:53,419
approach yes on the question is are

1278
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:55,550
there other public forums on people

1279
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:58,880
sharing this type of information if you

1280
00:50:55,550 --> 00:51:02,900
get all miter attack again there's so

1281
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,820
much stuff there if you go out there

1282
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,230
you're gonna see and I think one of the

1283
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:07,430
best cases would be look at some of the

1284
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:10,460
tools people are using a lot of mate

1285
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:12,379
right so the way I defined it within a

1286
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:14,030
complexity one you're pretty much doing

1287
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:15,680
everything in that technique verbatim

1288
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:17,030
right whatever they say whatever tool

1289
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,470
they're using that's what we're going to

1290
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:20,480
use as you get to the higher tech

1291
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:23,029
complexities that's when you start kind

1292
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,010
of getting more creative as far as forms

1293
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:27,350
I mean I would suggest visiting the

1294
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:28,460
attack site first and see them because

1295
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:31,370
there's gonna be some links there's some

1296
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:33,230
other good talks out there some of the

1297
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:36,560
key folks on the whole attack project

1298
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:38,570
have some excellent you know webinars

1299
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,190
out there that you can look at you know

1300
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:41,360
like with the whole groups thing you

1301
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,680
know it was only a couple months ago

1302
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,110
that I started seeing that stuff around

1303
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,940
and so you know that's something that I

1304
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:49,850
don't know how I knew that is I just I

1305
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:51,290
never saw that and so you know one of

1306
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:53,540
the big things I do is follow attack on

1307
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:55,520
Twitter which kind of helps but yes far

1308
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:56,570
as documenting because again I mean it's

1309
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,650
purple teaming and you're not gonna get

1310
00:51:56,570 --> 00:52:00,080
too much information out about your

1311
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:26,990
organization but but I would start at

1312
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:28,100
the the attack website yes like the

1313
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:30,439
outcome that's a really good question

1314
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:32,210
too so say you're a smaller organization

1315
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,610
right and you don't have a dedicated red

1316
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:37,040
team but say you have you know five

1317
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:38,420
people on the blue team you could do now

1318
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,680
I'm not saying this is a bad approach

1319
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:41,450
but here's the issue you could run into

1320
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,190
so you're not big enough to have your

1321
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:45,230
full dedicated red team you don't want

1322
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:47,240
to pay to have a red team come in you

1323
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:49,220
wanna do some basic testing find a blue

1324
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,770
team member who has got you know maybe

1325
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:53,089
went through some pen testing classes

1326
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:54,980
the problem you could run into is it's

1327
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:56,510
almost like playing in game right like

1328
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,950
say you're playing chess by yourself you

1329
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:59,900
already anticipate the outcome you

1330
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:02,750
already know what's gonna happen you

1331
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:06,380
could run into that issue but I think

1332
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:09,020
again with with sitting down you know is

1333
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:10,820
one group because you know historically

1334
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,410
we've always worked in silos you always

1335
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,700
have your red team coming in and it's

1336
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:15,200
it's almost like you're kind of fighting

1337
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,689
right if the red team can't do anything

1338
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,490
the blue team wins and then vice versa

1339
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:21,110
and so again I think that's one of the

1340
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:22,939
the biggest benefits is just coming

1341
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:25,100
together you know as one team with that

1342
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:27,650
common goal and I have not really seen

1343
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,970
any issues of you know someone saying I

1344
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:30,290
will probably shouldn't test this

1345
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:31,459
because I know that maybe this is broken

1346
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,529
it's more or less let's get some

1347
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:35,150
exposure out there let's bring this to

1348
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:37,820
light to get in front of management

1349
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:38,740
again to ultimately improve the security

1350
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:41,740
posture

1351
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:41,740
yes

1352
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:09,830
now I think that's that's very valid

1353
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:11,690
right there's times where penetration

1354
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:13,520
testing makes the most sense to you know

1355
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:14,869
if it's just a web application we want

1356
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,730
to find exploitable vulnerabilities in

1357
00:54:14,869 --> 00:54:18,980
that of course can I do you know more of

1358
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:22,280
a pen test approach there I think red

1359
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:24,260
teaming is key you know I think that if

1360
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,670
you're very mature I think red team

1361
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,440
you'll probably get more from that

1362
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:29,060
because again you do want to test the

1363
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,860
response you do want to see okay what

1364
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,940
are these playbooks look like on the

1365
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:35,540
blue team as you're going through those

1366
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:38,119
exercises but if you think about what

1367
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:39,619
the end goal is say it is to compromise

1368
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:40,940
that business critical application or

1369
00:54:39,619 --> 00:54:42,980
just to see you know if you want to look

1370
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:44,660
at okay what can we do with visible

1371
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:46,760
security assessments or with social

1372
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:48,319
engineering definitely red team but if

1373
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,790
you're like here's what we're at you

1374
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,410
know we're standing up the sim our sim

1375
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:53,480
is here and we want it to get to a

1376
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:55,069
maturity level down here purple team

1377
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:58,160
that thing all day long because you're

1378
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:59,240
gonna be able to uncover gaps and then

1379
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,250
fix those gaps that are much quicker

1380
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:03,140
pace right because it's coming up right

1381
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:04,580
there the blue team sees it and the blue

1382
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:06,650
team is able to leverage their

1383
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:09,400
creativity and figure out okay here's

1384
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:09,400
how we can gain visibility
