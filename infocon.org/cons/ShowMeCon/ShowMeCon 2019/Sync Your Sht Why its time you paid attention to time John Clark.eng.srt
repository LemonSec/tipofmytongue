2
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,640
all right this next guy likes a good

3
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:21,040
time

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,040
and he's the sultan of time John Clark

5
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,910
what's going on everybody my name is

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,430
John Clark I'm the president and CEO of

7
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,320
master clock incorporated we are a st.

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,340
Charles based manufacturer of very very

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,210
accurate time and frequency products

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,710
manufacture everything here in the US

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,750
you got a staff of about twenty five

12
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,910
products in 104 countries around the

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,170
world here locally you'll use some of

14
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,000
our products if you fly in and out of

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,650
Lambert we're keeping time for all the

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,390
backend timing systems there at Lambert

17
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:53,030
we're about to get a contract from the

18
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:56,060
FAA for all the radar towers for the air

19
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,340
traffic control system if you ever watch

20
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,080
KMOV or listen to KMOX and those are our

21
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:04,129
systems that are time stamping the radio

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,720
video automation systems so it's a we

23
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,909
touch a lot of different industries and

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,500
obviously if you're keeping time on a

25
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:10,729
network you're essentially the beat of

26
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,860
the network like the heartbeat of the

27
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:15,500
system so if something can disrupt that

28
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,950
it can be quite catastrophic and so

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,929
following with parameter Security's

30
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,119
motto of Patric I thought we'd call

31
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:24,649
this one sink your why it's time

32
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,990
you paid more attention to time so I

33
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:28,369
appreciate you guys coming this talk was

34
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,289
actually scheduled to four o'clock but I

35
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:32,689
got to fly out tonight so they were kind

36
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:34,579
enough to move it up so what you will

37
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:36,079
learn today we'll talk about our precise

38
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:37,609
time and frequency is integral to just

39
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,960
about everything

40
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:40,759
failure of time and frequency has

41
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,740
significant impacts on modern

42
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:44,899
infrastructure there are ways to ensure

43
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,719
security of time and frequency solutions

44
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:49,069
and then lastly not all timing is legal

45
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:50,719
and we'll hope that you guys will walk

46
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:52,280
away from here with an understanding of

47
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,770
when is time considered legally

48
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,179
traceable why is it important and what

49
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:59,840
the role that it plays for a good

50
00:01:56,179 --> 00:02:02,090
security posture as well so like I said

51
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,770
about master clock we help broadcasters

52
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,850
make smooth programming transitions so

53
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,709
if you think about having remote

54
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,598
facilities we're going live to Portland

55
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:10,789
we're going live to Dallas in order to

56
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:12,709
get those two geographically disparate

57
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:14,690
systems working in cahoots with each

58
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:17,300
other the time reference has to be the

59
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,709
same will help astronauts with timely

60
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,420
launches the picture here is from the

61
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:22,430
fuchi know Space Center and over in

62
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,170
Italy we rebuilt the Kennedy Space

63
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,230
Center countdown system a couple years

64
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,260
ago moved them into

65
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,119
networked world and it's they were using

66
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,709
you know 1960s technology to live off

67
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,629
stuff leave the atmosphere and so we

68
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,069
were able to take a fresh look at it and

69
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:37,260
now if it leaves the atmosphere we

70
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:39,629
probably have something to do with it

71
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,370
help aviators arrive safely on time you

72
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:43,018
think about radar systems they fire up

73
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,099
the pulse and they measure how long it

74
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,379
takes to come back and then they

75
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,819
estimate distance based on that so the

76
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:50,518
more accurate your clock the more

77
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:51,899
accurate your radar picture can be and

78
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,459
then ensure network stability and

79
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,019
security so time stamping of data

80
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,819
transfers for compliance and audit

81
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,290
purposes if you've ever had to go back

82
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,879
and try to do a security audit you know

83
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,459
how important time stamps are so I won't

84
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,768
go too far into that so like I said the

85
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,840
focus areas background and reasoning of

86
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:08,940
traceable time how is it delivered how

87
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,680
can it be impacted both over the network

88
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,109
as well as I'll talk about satellite

89
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,599
sync and how much we follow GPS and

90
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:17,310
others constellations what's being

91
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,709
funded for the future we'll talk about a

92
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,299
couple of things that are I guess three

93
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,310
things that are currently being funded

94
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:24,290
by various folks and should be impacting

95
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,170
our future here shortly

96
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:30,660
and we'll go from there so arriving at

97
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,099
our present time so time obviously is an

98
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,130
ancient art and we've been keeping it

99
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:36,929
for a long time the idea initially was

100
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,260
just trying to keep sequences of your

101
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,519
days when is noon you know at its apex

102
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,370
sundials were used just using the shadow

103
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,849
dictate as the Sun moves around you can

104
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,349
use that to tell your time we move then

105
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:51,418
into the Railroad era when they actually

106
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:53,488
put time zones in place the precise

107
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:55,049
reasoning was to avoid train collisions

108
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:56,430
you think if you're leaving st. Louis

109
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,290
station you think it's a certain time

110
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,849
and some train leaves Chicago and thinks

111
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,040
it's a different time you're gonna end

112
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:03,388
up with conflicts and so it was when

113
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,679
they started launching the railroads

114
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:05,910
that they realized we need to do

115
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,220
something about this and they actually

116
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,780
introduced time zones the whole point

117
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,209
was to save lives by making sure the

118
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,500
station's themselves were synchronized

119
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:16,470
the schedules were all the same across

120
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,539
the system so now we move into the

121
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,700
internet of things just about every

122
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:22,349
device that you've got is connected to

123
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,599
this whether it's your cell phone your

124
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:26,280
TV nowadays your oven your refrigerator

125
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:27,930
I mean everything that's connected to

126
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,400
the Internet of Things has to have an

127
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,120
accurate time source in order to play

128
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,950
part in the system Network Time Protocol

129
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,270
right now is essentially what keeps the

130
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,719
beat of the Internet

131
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,210
let's say

132
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,060
developed in 1985 by a guy named David

133
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,739
Mills and we as we would expect that a

134
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,240
system that is using network time

135
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,460
protocol to synchronize should be

136
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,440
accurate to a given reference within

137
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:55,659
thousandths of a second or milliseconds

138
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:58,360
so when we talk about NTP you know you

139
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,920
you have a device and you say okay I

140
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,500
want to go out on the internet I want to

141
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,790
get my time where does it go so we

142
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,520
talked about this concept of legal

143
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:08,410
traceability this means it's an unbroken

144
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,299
chain of comparisons or calibrations

145
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,220
between a measurement result and a

146
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,870
reference standard so that means you

147
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,940
have to be able to know if you say this

148
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,370
is what time it is how do you know that

149
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,050
I'm annealed saying a man with one clock

150
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,240
knows what time it is a man with two has

151
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,950
no idea so the idea is if you're gonna

152
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,300
say this is what time it is you have to

153
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,849
be able to define how you arrived at

154
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,190
that so this concept covers that and so

155
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,810
at each step as you're tracking what

156
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,030
time you think it is you have to show

157
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,830
how you arrived at that from your

158
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:39,099
reference any considerations that could

159
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:42,039
affect your your estimation what time it

160
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,720
is and then you'll want to know what's

161
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,640
the reference so I talked about making

162
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,640
sure your time is accurate well to what

163
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,620
how does the world define time so

164
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,110
there's a document called circular T

165
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,300
circular T is a monthly publication put

166
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,680
out by the BI p.m. it's the Bureau of

167
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,230
international measurements over in

168
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,630
France and essentially what circular T

169
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,950
is it's a month monthly publication

170
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,570
where they look at all the different

171
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,490
laboratories in the world that are

172
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,510
keeping time and they say how do we all

173
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,310
compare to each other

174
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,260
it applies what's called a weight ratio

175
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,490
to each laboratory and I'll show a graph

176
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,650
that should explain this a little bit

177
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,720
better it compares the inputs from each

178
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,640
lab to generate metrics on how far each

179
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,460
is from the other and then comes up with

180
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,620
kind of a pooled calculated time so the

181
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,419
example all uses let's say you've got

182
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,800
one National Laboratory might try to use

183
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:29,109
the sizing of the images to represent

184
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,970
kind of a weighted ratio let's say this

185
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,470
is the Italians and they go to the bi

186
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,780
p.m. and they say we've been keeping

187
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,570
time here's our system we think it's

188
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,309
10:28 well then the Spaniards come in

189
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,650
and contribute their time and they say

190
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,660
well we think it's 10 27 in this case

191
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,830
since they have even ratios they would

192
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,470
end up averaging it out in the time

193
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,780
would be you know 10 27 and 30 seconds

194
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,630
the problem though is then the Russians

195
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,789
come in and say

196
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,740
this is what time we think it is then

197
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,000
the US Naval Observatory comes in the

198
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,280
National Institute of Standards and

199
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,110
Technology comes in everybody's keeping

200
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,059
time and they're all sending this data

201
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:04,910
to one location to be compared to each

202
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,430
other to see what the deltas are so what

203
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,500
this graph shows this is the monthly

204
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,940
publication called circular T and what

205
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,580
this is is it's a list of all the

206
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,290
National Laboratories just to be

207
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,930
specific you can see there's Calgary

208
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,850
there's Minsk and each of these values

209
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,130
is a number that's representing

210
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,720
billionths of a second that the labs are

211
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,550
off from each other so each of these

212
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,860
labs has a system they think here's the

213
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,110
time this compares it and says all right

214
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,030
you guys in Spain you're this is how far

215
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,130
you are off from the average you guys in

216
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,190
Argentina this is how far you are off

217
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:38,780
from the average and then they end up

218
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:41,330
correcting that time and that weighted

219
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:43,729
average becomes what's called UTC or

220
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,200
universal coordinated time and so it's

221
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,120
almost kind of ironic that the best

222
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,550
we've got right now to define a global

223
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,980
standard of time is updated once a month

224
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,030
and so there's a huge opportunities for

225
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,250
a little bit more political clout

226
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,780
cooperation because if we can't even

227
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:00,470
agree on what time it is and we've got

228
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,789
bigger problems so the next chart this

229
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,340
shows in the US there are two

230
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:06,740
laboratories that contribute to UTC one

231
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,900
is NIST out in Boulder the other is the

232
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,520
US Naval Observatory and what this graph

233
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,169
is showing is over a four year period

234
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,570
it's showing the deviation between the

235
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:16,280
two and over four years they had a drift

236
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,930
of about five billions of a second

237
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,190
against each other so we're getting

238
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,160
pretty good at keeping time with these

239
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,510
systems and the u.s. systems actually

240
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,010
contribute more than any other country

241
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:29,330
to the estimation of what time it is so

242
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:31,250
one of the things you get into those we

243
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,169
talk about what time is it well you've

244
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,610
got NIST which is the civilian public

245
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:36,740
facing side of it and then you've got

246
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,960
the US Naval Observatory which is the

247
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,820
military side and even those guys have

248
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,169
different time references when we're

249
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,460
talking about using the Internet and

250
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:45,800
we're talking about thousands of a

251
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,750
second it may not be as impactful but if

252
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,000
we start moving into autonomous vehicles

253
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,410
and other types of automation we really

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,550
need to get these tolerances tight and

255
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,550
make sure everybody's working on the

256
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,469
same system which is what we'll kind of

257
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,660
get into a little bit next so we talked

258
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,030
about legally traceable time the idea is

259
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,370
is if I say this is the time I have to

260
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,819
be able to show how that time relates to

261
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,429
what time

262
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:08,839
nist says it is how did I take this as a

263
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:11,149
reference point and arrive at this

264
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:15,410
outcome and what I wanted to do is just

265
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:16,639
go ahead and pull up a quick video oh I

266
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,368
guess we don't have connection to the

267
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:21,049
internet so that's going to be a bummer

268
00:09:19,369 --> 00:09:23,689
essentially what the video was is

269
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:26,029
there's a court case in Texas where they

270
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:27,889
had video surveillance imagery of

271
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:29,389
somebody in a parking lot the

272
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:31,429
prosecutors were trying to accuse this

273
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:33,559
man of essentially raping somebody and

274
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:35,029
they put the evidence into the patter

275
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:36,469
they put in the video evidence and they

276
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:38,720
said here's this video showing this

277
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,789
person was at this parking lot that

278
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,989
night and when they put the evidence in

279
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:44,600
they want to review it there was no

280
00:09:41,989 --> 00:09:46,579
timestamps on the video and because they

281
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,829
couldn't prove what time that had

282
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:50,388
occurred it's not considered admissible

283
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:51,618
in court because that could have been an

284
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,419
hour later than what they said it was

285
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:55,249
well midway through the court case

286
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:56,660
suddenly they figured out something with

287
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:58,939
their software and all of a sudden the

288
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,410
time stamps were available and they

289
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:02,719
ended up essentially declaring a

290
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,249
mistrial over it the prosecuting

291
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,079
attorney ended up being sanctioned by

292
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:07,789
the State Bar of Texas for with

293
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,309
essentially withholding evidence those

294
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:12,649
time stamps on the video were what ended

295
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:15,469
up leading to this guy Crispin Hormel

296
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:17,329
being convicted of murder in 2018 but

297
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,549
the video it's interesting because you

298
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:21,019
hear everybody talking the timestamps

299
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:22,789
are there the timestamps are there you

300
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:24,579
know they're valid but the one thing

301
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:27,019
they never asked is is it the right time

302
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:28,909
well how did we arrive at this time it's

303
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:30,529
just whether or not they're there and

304
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:32,389
the point of showing the video was I was

305
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,859
gonna introduce the idea once they put

306
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:35,419
the timestamps on the surveillance video

307
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:37,459
they said see now we've got the evidence

308
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:39,319
we're good well what if there was two

309
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:41,779
cameras in the parking lot and what if

310
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:43,699
they had conflicting timestamps what's

311
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:44,899
right you know what's the real time and

312
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:47,118
how do you define that so when you get

313
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:48,829
into the legal world in order for this

314
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:51,470
stuff to be used as evidence you have to

315
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:53,269
prove legal traceability to a given

316
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,649
reference which in this case would be

317
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:57,589
the National Institute of Standards and

318
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:59,829
Technology out of Boulder so I'll make

319
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:01,549
that a video will be available online

320
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:03,709
it's pretty cool it's about three

321
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:05,720
minutes you should check it out so now

322
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:07,189
we talked about you've got a time

323
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,720
reference at the National Institute of

324
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:10,579
Standards and Technology you've got a

325
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,589
client computer you're pointing to their

326
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:15,199
server and you're getting time updates

327
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:16,730
what can happen to disrupt that or what

328
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:18,979
can happen within the network time

329
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:21,139
protocol that can challenge your ability

330
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,820
to deliver timing with integrity one of

331
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:25,970
them is a distributed denial-of-service

332
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,889
attack so it's basically let's say

333
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,389
you've got your server up at nest

334
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:31,310
and you've got somebody next door and

335
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:34,399
you want to screw up their timing you

336
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:36,800
can essentially send a message to the

337
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,079
network Time Protocol server and you can

338
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,120
use what's called a Manas command or a

339
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:44,300
Mon get list command essentially what

340
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,649
this does to these servers if they're if

341
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,790
they're not configured appropriately

342
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:52,040
which turns out a lot of mark it asks

343
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,529
the server it says ok the mom has come

344
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,139
in will report the last 600 IP addresses

345
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:59,420
that connected to the server and so the

346
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:02,029
idea is is you can issue a command to a

347
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:04,729
server very very small amount of

348
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:06,079
bandwidth and it will respond with about

349
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,600
what ends up being two hundred and six

350
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,849
times the amount of information it took

351
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,410
in order to generate the request and the

352
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,180
analogy that I saw that I really liked

353
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,680
is the idea it's essentially like

354
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,779
calling a restaurant telling them I'll

355
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,370
have one of everything on the menu now

356
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,689
can you tell me what I ordered and then

357
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:23,300
the guy has to sit there and go through

358
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:25,000
everything in the menu and the idea with

359
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:28,250
the distributed denial of service attack

360
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,410
is you ping these servers with a spoofed

361
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,089
IP address of your target and you say I

362
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:34,189
want mom get list command I want to know

363
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:36,139
the last 600 IPS you connected to and

364
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,699
here's the address to send it to you

365
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:39,829
start scaling that with some sort of a

366
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:42,229
botnet and all said you've got a massive

367
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:44,149
amount of information that's going to be

368
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,459
overloading the target destination

369
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:48,440
server at a very highly efficient rate

370
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:49,880
which we call a distributed denial of

371
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,350
service attack which means regular

372
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,329
traffic wouldn't be able to access it

373
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,649
you've essentially overloaded the server

374
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:56,599
with noise and it can't figure out what

375
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:59,930
the clear signal is so this has happened

376
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,810
in the wild one of the the products that

377
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:05,120
we make to get around this to use an

378
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,859
air-gap network is we'll use GPS or

379
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,050
other satellite signals in order to

380
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,610
generate the time you know it's accurate

381
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,719
without connecting to the outside world

382
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,760
and allowing bi-directional

383
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,839
communication so there's ways you can

384
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,870
get around this and I'll talk a little

385
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:19,699
bit more about satellite sync coming up

386
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,290
so that's network time protocol the beat

387
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:23,300
of the Internet the heart beat of this

388
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:26,089
system there's it's vulnerable to

389
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,939
attacks another one it's called the kiss

390
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:29,800
of death so the kiss of death packet

391
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:32,290
comes from the

392
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,390
idea that NTP allows adjustable polling

393
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,560
rates so you've got a computer and most

394
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,689
computers aren't very good at keeping

395
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,399
time at the hardware level so you get to

396
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,500
tell it how often to pull your NTP

397
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,950
server and ask for an update the default

398
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,510
with the NTP daemon has 64 seconds you

399
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,610
can adjust that smaller or larger how

400
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,410
you want then one of the questions we

401
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,839
get when we sell our NTP servers and say

402
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,939
what's the client capacity how many hits

403
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:56,950
per second can it take and we say it

404
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,600
depends on your polling rate if you have

405
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,829
these things set up to pull every second

406
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,750
you're going to use up a lot more

407
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:03,609
bandwidth and we can't do as much but if

408
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,440
you go 64 seconds a lot of times we'll

409
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,240
work them in 10 minutes or 600 seconds

410
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,800
you get plenty of sync at the level you

411
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,839
need without overloading the network

412
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,089
well what the kiss of death packet does

413
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:15,220
is if a client starts taking starts

414
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:17,019
requesting too many times in any given

415
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,970
period the server will send it what's

416
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:21,250
called a kiss of death and it says for

417
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,600
this amount of given time you don't ask

418
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,029
me what time it is anymore you've been

419
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,190
asking too much need to chill out when

420
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:29,560
the kiss of death packet goes the

421
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,690
standard itself it's the way the math

422
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,910
works is if you put a value of 17 in

423
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,860
this kiss of death packet say it'll go

424
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,199
to to the 17 seconds which ends up being

425
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,730
about 36 hours and so the standard

426
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,050
itself says that the most you're

427
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:44,140
supposed to be able to tell a server did

428
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:46,060
not pull for time is about 36 hours but

429
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,470
in a Boston University research paper

430
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,089
called attacking the network time

431
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,070
protocol they actually went out in the

432
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,480
wild and looked and said how are the

433
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,850
implementations being done and what

434
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,529
actually works and what they found is

435
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:59,649
that most of these clients would accept

436
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:01,510
the value of 25 which means that once

437
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,860
they accept that condition they're not

438
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,649
going to ask what time it is for over a

439
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,480
year and so the idea is is you can trick

440
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:08,680
these clients into thinking that they've

441
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,209
been bad and they've been calling too

442
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,430
many times and you're now rate limited

443
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:14,800
and then they won't ask for over a year

444
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:16,750
I mentioned that a lot of hardware

445
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,430
clocks on these computers aren't very

446
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,829
accurate you know the hardware wasn't

447
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:23,290
designed for sync windows doesn't

448
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:24,520
prioritize timing too well and I wanted

449
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:27,130
to bring all this up because it directly

450
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,720
affects blockchain art good I'm so

451
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,880
blockchain and I'm not a blockchain

452
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,290
expert to us so if somebody has really

453
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,970
difficult questions you know I'd

454
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,870
probably have to go back to my engineers

455
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,390
and follow up with you

456
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:40,329
but this blockchain essentially creates

457
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:41,710
these timestamp blocks that are then put

458
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:43,900
through this proof of work

459
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,790
a consensus level and as long as

460
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,860
everybody agrees on it then the block is

461
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:49,900
added to the blockchain the validity

462
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,370
interval from the research we had done

463
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,770
shows that these blocks are valid for

464
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,360
about two hours and so the the

465
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:57,370
predictive effects that could happen

466
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,260
with a properly executed scaled kissa

467
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,120
death attack is you could essentially

468
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,890
stop these clients that are trying to do

469
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,780
this time stamping from ever querying

470
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,189
the time they're drifting and they don't

471
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,300
report it because they've been told not

472
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,910
to ask what time it is

473
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,469
and if you could get the time to drift

474
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:14,050
far enough you could have those valid

475
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,400
blocks being rejected because your time

476
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,599
stamping is often you can't get a

477
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,689
consensus if you all think it's a

478
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,880
different time so the idea is is time in

479
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,560
order for this cryptocurrency process to

480
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,420
work everything's got to be in sync

481
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,829
everything's got to be on the same page

482
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,839
and if you don't pay attention to it

483
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:34,440
then it can affect the underlying

484
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:36,790
results of the system and so within this

485
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,220
time keeps on slipping on and here's

486
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:41,680
another song we start talking about

487
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,450
right so what is a second you know when

488
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,979
we say that these guys are defining time

489
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,470
they're comparing their time you know

490
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,900
down to the billionth of a second well

491
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,760
how do they get that comparison seconds

492
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,100
Bendis I been defined as around nine

493
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,990
trillion cycles of a cesium atom so they

494
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,930
put a cesium atom at a very certain

495
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,700
state certain temperature and they have

496
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:02,620
it oscillate a certain amount of times

497
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,170
and when it completes that oscillation

498
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,359
that's defined this is a second and the

499
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:09,370
idea is the cesium atom in France and

500
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,780
Australia or in America should all

501
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:14,800
perform the same so we should have a

502
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:17,770
universal concept of time the problem

503
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,190
though is that the Earth's rotation is

504
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:22,389
slowing down and so you've got a

505
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:25,870
coincidence now or we've got time

506
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:28,240
defined as a fixed value on earth but

507
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:31,030
yet we want that to work into a 24-hour

508
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,830
day then which that rotation we've

509
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,810
defined it at is becoming inconsistent

510
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:37,710
so they've introduced what's called leap

511
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:40,030
seconds and leap seconds are irregular

512
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:41,800
ads that they have to do when they

513
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,270
detect that the Earth's rotation is

514
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,409
slowing down enough they'll announce it

515
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,300
six months out and they're going to say

516
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:50,110
just like a leap day we're going to have

517
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:51,580
a leap second and so I wanted to point

518
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,929
out sometimes that this hasn't actually

519
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:57,480
worked out too well back in July of 2012

520
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:59,070
they implemented a leap second and you

521
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,900
can see on the title of the article leap

522
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,060
second hits Qantas air bookings already

523
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,770
at Mozilla stuttered the addition of the

524
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,210
extra second between Saturday and Sunday

525
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,590
to account for the slowing rotation of

526
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,120
the earth affected flight check-ins in

527
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,770
Australia and hit popular websites

528
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,300
including Yelp and Foursquare

529
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,950
I remember what we set each of these

530
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,990
laboratories is keeping their own time

531
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:19,260
and for it to be legally traceable I

532
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:21,240
have to show that my time comes with an

533
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,220
unbroken chain that I can measure the

534
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,170
uncertainty from NIST if you're in the

535
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,570
Philippines you're pointing to what's

536
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:30,150
called one time because they've got

537
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,110
their own National Laboratory and it's

538
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,270
kind of funny because we've had

539
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,280
customers that have told us hey to sell

540
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:38,129
into the Philippines if time starts

541
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,110
drifting away from GPS or from UTC we

542
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,610
need to follow one time because their

543
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,679
national timing Laboratory didn't have a

544
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,090
very good system but legally if that

545
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,250
drifted away from the consensus the

546
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,570
world had you had to follow that so

547
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,710
think about all these IT systems and

548
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,629
these other in these different countries

549
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,940
they're all required to point to their

550
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:56,310
own source what happened was as Qantas

551
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,750
airlines who's using a the Amadeus

552
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,000
booking system which was hosted in

553
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,640
Germany and so you have systems in

554
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,960
Australia systems in Germany they

555
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,220
applied the leap second at different

556
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,200
times all of a sudden the time

557
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,520
validations weren't working and they

558
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,770
lost a lot of money when their flights

559
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,129
went down and it was all because of a

560
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:15,150
leap second so leap seconds the

561
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,580
different systems were pointing to

562
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,350
different references and they utilize

563
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,760
different conflicting references in this

564
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,610
case they applied leap seconds

565
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:26,490
differently time wasn't in sync since

566
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:28,919
1972 when they first started realizing

567
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,830
we need to add leap seconds we've had 27

568
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,090
of them added and they you know the hard

569
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,679
part about our systems is it's not a

570
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,840
regular interval that they announce

571
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,160
these things so you just have to be

572
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:43,350
ready when they do it your systems have

573
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:45,090
to work it's a can be kind of pain so I

574
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,010
was a guy named Jeff Sherman at NIST

575
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,480
who's an expert in this stuff one of his

576
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,040
presentations he said the good thing

577
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,680
about having a standard is that there's

578
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,450
so many up and it's really true when we

579
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,850
talk about how do we keep time how do we

580
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,250
apply leap seconds Google has their own

581
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:01,139
way of doing it and yeah so when I say

582
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,970
the Google this Google skew that pops up

583
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,350
what that means is they announced

584
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,110
they're going to do a leap second and on

585
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,490
some Saturday six months in the future

586
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:11,039
time we need to add

587
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,809
value into time in order to account for

588
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,090
the slowing rotation so what Google does

589
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:16,619
ten hours before the leap seconds

590
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,749
supposed to be implemented they actually

591
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:20,490
slow down the rate that they keep time I

592
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:22,710
think it's about point point one four

593
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:25,110
percent and the idea is is that over

594
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,360
that 10 hour period they slow down time

595
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,979
when the leap second hits it's already

596
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,479
accounted for about half of it and then

597
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,279
it accounts for the other half of it in

598
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,480
the next 10 hours with the prediction

599
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:35,700
that the most of clients should be off

600
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,590
is by half a second well that's all good

601
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,909
but the US government they want to do it

602
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,619
their own way so the Department of

603
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:42,029
Homeland Security mandates government

604
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:43,799
systems follow what's called the single

605
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:45,269
tick method and that means that when

606
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:51,629
we're going to add a leap second week

607
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:52,830
out 57 58 59 60 then 0 and you can think

608
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:54,809
the clock is supposed to be a very

609
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:57,178
consistent thing very logical but now

610
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:59,009
we're having to add a random time in at

611
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:01,200
an unannounced interval and we need the

612
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:03,809
entire global network and system to do

613
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,519
it at the exact same time and so there's

614
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:07,350
other proprietary methods some of the

615
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,179
financial trading systems I think about

616
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,949
high-frequency trading that all takes

617
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:12,929
advantage of timing latency arbitrage

618
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,059
and if people can find ways that they

619
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:18,179
think they can cheat the system they'll

620
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:19,490
change the way they do things so we're

621
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:22,110
still trying to work and come to a

622
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:24,559
consensus on what time it is and how we

623
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,610
apply things like leaks at leap seconds

624
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,470
there's actually a lot of groups that

625
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:31,110
want to get rid of the concept of a leap

626
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:34,049
second the pushback is that if you do

627
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:36,508
that then in 300 years the apex of the

628
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:38,100
Sun will no longer be at noon I'll be an

629
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:39,720
hour off and so the thought is they

630
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,399
don't want that to happen and so for the

631
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,429
next 300 years you get to suffer with

632
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:45,899
unannounced irregular changes to time

633
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:48,059
that need to be implemented on a global

634
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:51,149
scale with disparate systems it's kind

635
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:52,619
of a mess what's interesting too is as a

636
00:21:51,149 --> 00:21:54,539
result of these leap seconds that

637
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:56,519
they've added you've got UTC on earth

638
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:57,749
I'm the problem though is we're now

639
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:59,999
starting to get outside of the

640
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:02,129
atmosphere and so they've now defined a

641
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:05,639
second time astronomical time

642
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:09,299
abbreviated T AI which is 37 seconds off

643
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:11,668
from UTC and so starts getting confusing

644
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:14,539
network time protocol is based on UTC

645
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:17,279
now the new new protocols based on T AI

646
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:19,400
so fundamentally the the building block

647
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:22,460
we use for time I mean we're

648
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,410
kind of all over the place so eyes on

649
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,730
the sky and so you're concerned about

650
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,500
being on the network you're concerned

651
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,910
about taking this computer pointing it

652
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,310
to the public network and allowing that

653
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:34,280
potential bi-directional traffic so

654
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:36,470
we'll use GNSS systems used to everyone

655
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,389
used to notice GPS but now all these

656
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,640
countries want their own so it's GNSS

657
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,350
you got the Global Positioning System

658
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,450
you got the Russian GLONASS system you

659
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:46,909
got the European Galileo system the

660
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,770
Chinese Baidu system now that the Brits

661
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,820
got kicked out of or now with brexit

662
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,440
going they've been kicked out of the

663
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,629
Galileo program and now the Brits might

664
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,490
launch their own too so everyone's got

665
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:58,460
their own satellite system used for

666
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:00,380
positioning and all the capabilities in

667
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,330
order to arrive at a valid position is

668
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,920
all based on time each of these

669
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:07,159
satellites hasn't a very accurate atomic

670
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,440
clock on board and it's sending out what

671
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,660
time it is and where it's at in the sky

672
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,640
your receiver is essentially receiving

673
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,110
all of those calculating the latency

674
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,180
saying if this is where it's at in the

675
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:19,189
sky and took this long to get here I

676
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,450
know this is the diameter or the radius

677
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,010
of where it could be

678
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,560
and once you've got three satellite

679
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:26,780
locks you can triangulate so the ability

680
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,179
to position yourselves using GPS is

681
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,620
entirely dependent upon time making sure

682
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,180
those satellites have the right time

683
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,040
making sure your receivers doing the

684
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:37,100
math appropriately so we have a lot of

685
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:39,889
systems that we use or GPS base time

686
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,389
references within this we can pull the

687
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,790
pulse per second and that comes from the

688
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,290
GPS signals and we can take two boxes

689
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,760
and put them anywhere on the planet and

690
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,470
we can assume that they're going to be

691
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,170
within 20 billions of a second of each

692
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,580
other so the GPS and these other like

693
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,530
satellite systems are some of the most

694
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,990
phenomenal feats of engineering their

695
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:59,300
uptime is incredible but they have

696
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,880
become a single point of failure for a

697
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:04,040
lot of different systems so if we've all

698
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,510
used GPS we all used to do a lot of

699
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,899
things so I'll talk about a couple times

700
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:11,540
where that usage didn't go so smoothly

701
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:12,980
so this is our guy and Gary Bojack and

702
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:15,200
you can see from the picture it's

703
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:17,720
obviously a not on birthday car that's a

704
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,360
news release so what Gary do he was an

705
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,100
engineering worker in New Jersey and

706
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,719
this company had one of those apps that

707
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,149
would track where he was at what he was

708
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,740
doing apply some traceability to it well

709
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,930
Gary didn't want that so here anyone

710
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,280
online any about $100 GPS jammer and he

711
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,010
said they're not going to know where I

712
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,389
am I'm gonna

713
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:38,700
just jam my GPS that's all good but he

714
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:40,440
did it at Newark Airport his route every

715
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,480
day took him right behind Newark Airport

716
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,330
and he's going using a GPS jammer so his

717
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,770
company can't track him the end result

718
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,050
is they started having some issues with

719
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:51,870
some of the airport systems somebody

720
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:53,460
spoke up and mr. Geary ended up getting

721
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,409
fined does anybody want to throw out a

722
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:58,740
guess of how much you would get fined

723
00:24:55,410 --> 00:25:03,240
for using a GPS jammer unauthorized near

724
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:06,740
an airport what you think lovey dovey

725
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:09,120
nice what do you think ten thousand

726
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,620
thirty two thousand dollars it was a

727
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,860
fine that they ended up levying on him

728
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:16,169
for a hundred our GPS jammer so it was a

729
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:18,209
quite a payday for somebody and not him

730
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:20,460
so that's one example this is a

731
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,840
unintended consequence of a guy just

732
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,520
trying to spoof his employer a little

733
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,860
bit and the result is he's putting air

734
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,150
traffic control in danger I know so

735
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,189
that's not very good we don't like that

736
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,020
this is just an amateur guy using a

737
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,230
hundred dollar jammer what happens if

738
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:36,210
you start getting professional about it

739
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:38,010
so this was a the sky magic drone show

740
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,420
was taking place in Hong Kong you guys

741
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:41,370
have seen these drone shows that Intel

742
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,660
will do will take a hundred drones up in

743
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:44,310
the make picture of a flower and then

744
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,170
they'll spell somebody's name and you

745
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,700
know do whatever they were doing one of

746
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,020
those in Hong Kong it was a company

747
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,000
called sky magic they had about a

748
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,139
hundred drones in the air I'm suddenly

749
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,960
when they were in the middle of

750
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,580
something something went wrong and forty

751
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,160
two the drones ended up just dropping

752
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,300
out of the sky on the spot and it turns

753
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,990
out when they went back and did some

754
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:06,720
forensics did some investigations there

755
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:08,580
was an a GPS jammer a very strong one

756
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,860
that was happening in the area hit the

757
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,240
drone suddenly and they lost temporal

758
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,399
awareness they didn't know where they

759
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,380
were anymore they were programmed that

760
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,580
if something went wrong you go home I

761
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,500
mean this is the point you're going to

762
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,970
go everything's gonna be good but you

763
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,590
got to know where you're at before you

764
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:23,760
figure out where you're gonna go and if

765
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:26,250
the drones don't know where they're at

766
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,740
they literally just dropped out of the

767
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,780
sky and so you can imagine 40 of these

768
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,430
drones suddenly dropping out of the sky

769
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:34,470
and he has two mitts on what the

770
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:35,180
collateral damage was things on the

771
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,570
ground

772
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,570
so what do you think

773
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,840
a little bit higher what do you think a

774
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:51,770
little bit lower so the ending result

775
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:54,440
was $127,000 us and damage so again

776
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:55,940
they'd still don't know who did that but

777
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,830
we saw our guy Gary with a hundred bucks

778
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,390
to disrupt an airport now somebody just

779
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:01,070
came in and caused you know six figures

780
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,420
worth of damage this could have been

781
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,760
another hundred dollar device we don't

782
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,080
know and that's what's scary about it so

783
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,520
you look first we had the amateur guy

784
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,960
trying to you know get around his

785
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,670
employment and now we've got a pretty

786
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,090
public spectacle that should be kind of

787
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:15,380
scary let's talk about a UH actually I

788
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,820
had another slide I was going to use

789
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,740
here if you guys look up what's going on

790
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:21,290
they were doing some drills in the

791
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:22,490
Baltics in Norway just recently and

792
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:25,190
there's a lot of reports over the

793
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:26,690
Russians jamming the GPS you think about

794
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:28,970
our ability to deliver a precision

795
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:31,220
guided bomb somewhere if it doesn't have

796
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:32,840
GPS it's not going to get there and so

797
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,150
our adversaries and other folks around

798
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,178
the world are very interested in finding

799
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:41,570
out how can we disrupt the integrity of

800
00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:44,179
the timing systems and so one example

801
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,710
and this is a this is actually from June

802
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:47,300
9th and 10th of this year and it's

803
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,190
actually still being affected did

804
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:52,760
anybody fly out Monday or Tuesday and

805
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:54,080
have a flight delayed one of our

806
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,640
contractors that was in town actually

807
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,590
got affected by this there was over 400

808
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,850
flights that were delayed starting June

809
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:01,459
9th and 10th and some of them are

810
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:02,780
actually still being delayed what

811
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,590
happened was there's a system called the

812
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,540
ATSB

813
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:07,520
it's the automatic dependent

814
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,960
surveillance broadcast system and it's

815
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,879
essentially when these planes they've

816
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,850
got radar systems tracking them the

817
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,530
planes have GPS onboard this ATSB system

818
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:17,449
is a communication system that the

819
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:19,760
planes can use to talk to each other to

820
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:21,080
talk to air traffic control the has all

821
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,420
the parameters about where they're at

822
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,490
how they're flying and that all feeds

823
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,990
into a collision avoidance system the

824
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:28,370
idea is using some automation to make

825
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,630
sure people don't make dumb mistakes and

826
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,428
the planes cannot talk to each other

827
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:35,840
well that's all good

828
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:37,580
and so they apply an update and so this

829
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,570
was a when it first happened there's

830
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,730
some questions about what could have

831
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:42,889
caused it it's a lot of text here but

832
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:45,620
it's uh the root cause is a software

833
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:49,040
design error that misinterprets GPS time

834
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:51,050
updates a leap second occurs every once

835
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,519
every 2.5 years in the u.s. government

836
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:54,259
gps satellite Almanac

837
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:56,749
date in which they said it's consistent

838
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:58,429
it's inconsistent our GPS and they have

839
00:28:56,749 --> 00:29:00,200
two product numbers software timing

840
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:02,089
calculations have reacted to this leap

841
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,459
second by not tracking satellites upon

842
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:06,619
powerup and subsequently failing a

843
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:07,909
regularly scheduled Almanac update with

844
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:10,699
this leap second was distributed by the

845
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:13,070
US government at zero zero zero GMT on

846
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,589
Sunday June 9th and the failures begin

847
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:17,479
to occur after this event and so this is

848
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:19,219
happening right now I'm flying out to

849
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:21,109
London tonight and right now in the US a

850
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:22,429
lot of these airplanes cannot fly over

851
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:23,958
twenty eight thousand five hundred feet

852
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:26,029
because the limitations because they're

853
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:27,619
ATSB systems aren't working there's a

854
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:31,070
mandate that all aircraft flying in the

855
00:29:27,619 --> 00:29:32,839
US have an ATS B transponder by 2020 as

856
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,399
long as it works you know and we just

857
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:35,719
showed that you know our boy Gary can

858
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,089
shut down the airport with one little

859
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:39,829
jammer one software update can have a

860
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:42,200
scalable impact and shut down the US

861
00:29:39,829 --> 00:29:43,399
airspace and it's all because of time

862
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,809
and that's all being you know in this

863
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:48,349
case it's because of time for Gary it's

864
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:49,908
because agreed I guess I'm ignorant so

865
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:51,200
the question would be how much does

866
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:53,479
something like this cost

867
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,399
you know let's see the estimated impact

868
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:56,929
do what do you think how much how much

869
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:58,639
money would you say that disrupting the

870
00:29:56,929 --> 00:30:01,639
entire air traffic control system the US

871
00:29:58,639 --> 00:30:03,199
would cost the millions and millions and

872
00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:03,738
so rather than try to estimate I said

873
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,009
good lord

874
00:30:03,739 --> 00:30:08,929
because it's the impacts are far you

875
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:10,309
know it's the confidence we're already

876
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:11,599
having issues and you know not thinking

877
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:13,549
are the planes we're gonna fly get us

878
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:15,979
there safe now can they talk to each

879
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:19,099
other can they communicate so this stuff

880
00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:21,339
has a very very real impacts on our

881
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:25,218
ability to you know exist and

882
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:27,229
successfully work in a modern world so

883
00:30:25,219 --> 00:30:28,940
now that nobody wants to fly and and

884
00:30:27,229 --> 00:30:30,619
everyone's bitcoins are about to be

885
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,329
hacked and everybody screwed what are we

886
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:34,999
doing about it

887
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:37,009
so we'll talk ticking forward this is a

888
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:38,450
pretty cool project and since again I

889
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:41,119
don't have the internet so I can't pull

890
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:42,709
it up but this is a launch that's taking

891
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:46,279
place on a Falcon Heavy satellite On

892
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:48,259
June 22nd there's a new mercury atomic

893
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:50,419
clock that they think is going to be the

894
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:52,700
future of navigating in space for the

895
00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:54,649
United States the idea of being like I

896
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,259
said you have GPS satellites with known

897
00:30:54,649 --> 00:30:58,728
locations in known time broadcasting the

898
00:30:57,259 --> 00:31:00,469
receiver and that's how you try and get

899
00:30:58,729 --> 00:31:02,629
your position what happens when you get

900
00:31:00,469 --> 00:31:03,919
beyond GPS what happens when we're going

901
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:06,439
to Mars and we're trying to figure out

902
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,630
how far away is that spaceship from

903
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,730
where

904
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,050
right now plus snow and the Martian Day

905
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,370
actually runs at a different rate than

906
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,720
the US you know that's going to have

907
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:15,389
more complications to it do they have

908
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,190
leap seconds we don't know so the idea

909
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:18,720
is is that they've got a very very

910
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:20,430
accurate clock they can put on board

911
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,320
these ships and as they go they can send

912
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:24,390
a radio beam out they can measure that

913
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,399
latency and as long as the timing on

914
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,990
board this vehicle is accurate they'll

915
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,090
be able to navigate successfully in

916
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,990
space so these clocks that they're

917
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:34,830
putting out here they have to be

918
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:36,090
radiation tolerant they have to this I

919
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,770
think the guys they put in here are

920
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:40,169
about 50 times more accurate than the

921
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:42,540
clocks and the GPS satellites which

922
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:44,910
loosed you know a second and hundreds of

923
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:47,220
millions of years from the GPS

924
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:48,840
satellites if you were to have one clock

925
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,520
that had an error of a billionth of a

926
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,800
second that would translate to 30

927
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,260
centimeters on the ground so you think

928
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,460
about if a clock ticks off by too much

929
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,660
you think you're driving down Lake

930
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,830
Michigan and all of a sudden are you

931
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,780
thinking you're driving on Michigan

932
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:02,669
Avenue and your positioning says you're

933
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,990
in Lake Michigan I mean these are very

934
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,760
real things that can happen to

935
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:08,460
autonomous vehicles if we don't we're

936
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,440
not careful about them so that same idea

937
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,390
of how you triangulate that has to

938
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,160
happen in space at some point and that's

939
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,990
why they've invented this astronomical

940
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,580
time so that future generations aren't

941
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,230
you know burden by trying to just keep

942
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:21,990
time on earth when they're slowing down

943
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:24,210
you know you think that what time is it

944
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:25,680
it's such a simple question and who is

945
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:28,440
that simple I wouldn't have a job so I'm

946
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:30,240
about as complicated and that clocks

947
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,770
launching on June 22nd onboard of a

948
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:37,320
falcon heavy so this is very real time

949
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:39,150
talk about quantum synchronization so

950
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,000
everyone nowadays talk about the quantum

951
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:44,190
world and qubits and what this all means

952
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,660
this was a document of course Raytheon

953
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:47,910
jumped ahead of everybody and they have

954
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,080
they patented the idea of quantum

955
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:50,670
synchronization for classical

956
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,780
distributed systems it's not that

957
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:53,040
they've actually done this and they

958
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,270
clearly state that in the patent they

959
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,399
just think it's a good idea so when

960
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:59,160
someone does it they did at first but

961
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:02,280
the idea is is using a quantum

962
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:05,160
entanglement it's basically you can get

963
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:07,170
two of these particles that regardless

964
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:10,080
of where they're at geographically

965
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:11,730
demonstrate the same characteristics the

966
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,169
idea is as long as you don't directly

967
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:15,540
observe them but you can direct you can

968
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:17,700
observe an indirect effect of it if you

969
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,870
have two devices doesn't matter where

970
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,190
they're at geographically they could be

971
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,959
on different planets but

972
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:24,090
the characteristic of one is the same as

973
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,120
the characteristic of another you've got

974
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:29,939
a perfectly in phase zero latency timing

975
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,500
system because now every node that is

976
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,779
quantum entangled to the other is

977
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,490
ticking at the exact same rate there's

978
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:37,409
no latency there's no time to wait to

979
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:39,840
figure out what time it is so these

980
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:42,240
future systems once they can get this

981
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,309
technology and get it matured it's going

982
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,620
to completely change radically the way

983
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:51,389
that we define and keep time around the

984
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:53,489
universe really so it's a it's going to

985
00:33:51,389 --> 00:33:54,990
be interesting once we get there the

986
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:56,669
last thing I wanted to discuss and this

987
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:59,850
is kind of the cutting edge of the

988
00:33:56,669 --> 00:34:02,309
science right now is what happens when

989
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:04,408
we start integrating electronics in with

990
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:06,029
biology now we've already got pacemakers

991
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,289
a pacemaker is essentially a time and

992
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:10,440
frequency device to keep the heart

993
00:34:07,289 --> 00:34:12,899
beating appropriately there's some

994
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,730
pretty interesting text that I found a

995
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:16,739
paper called functional synchronization

996
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:18,990
the emergence of coordinated activity in

997
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:21,328
human systems and what that summarizes

998
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:23,250
up is saying they've realized now that

999
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:25,220
the human body is a system just like a

1000
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:28,260
computer network or other connected

1001
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:29,969
system of sorts and all these different

1002
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,389
activities are sequentially occurring

1003
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:35,339
based on some sort of an underlying

1004
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:37,589
timing constant within the body and the

1005
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:39,359
idea is is that research the last Nobel

1006
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:42,000
Prize I think not last year with year

1007
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,219
before went to folks that were studying

1008
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,260
the timing mechanisms inside some

1009
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:47,699
certain type of fly with the idea that

1010
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:50,579
if you can understand the timing

1011
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:52,739
mechanisms of the body you can now have

1012
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:55,169
deterministic electronic communication

1013
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:56,578
with the biological systems and you can

1014
00:34:55,168 --> 00:34:57,810
now integrate just like we said with

1015
00:34:56,579 --> 00:34:59,220
leap seconds if the two timing

1016
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:00,569
references say something different

1017
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,089
you're gonna have conflicts and you're

1018
00:35:00,569 --> 00:35:04,589
gonna have some issues just like once we

1019
00:35:03,089 --> 00:35:05,069
start implanting electronics into the

1020
00:35:04,589 --> 00:35:06,720
body

1021
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:08,160
think about your ability to attack the

1022
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,140
security of that I mean you could

1023
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,220
literally start killing people and the

1024
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,690
reason people are paying a lot of

1025
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,189
attention to this bio digital

1026
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,930
synchronization possibility of the

1027
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,670
future this guy is a billionaire named

1028
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:20,069
Elon Musk you tends to throw out crazy

1029
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:21,990
ideas announced as pursuit of the neural

1030
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:23,790
link system essentially allowing your

1031
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,589
body or your mind to connect via some

1032
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:27,180
sort of Wi-Fi or sorts directly to the

1033
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:28,828
internet getting rid of the lack of

1034
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,000
bandwidth you have when you've only got

1035
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:31,890
ten fingers to communicate the

1036
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,690
information that is all going to be

1037
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,000
entirely dependent upon how well we can

1038
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,860
keep

1039
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,200
time between our existing electronic

1040
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,900
systems and the body's interpretation of

1041
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,339
it so that's uh that's kind of where the

1042
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,770
where things are going that's where

1043
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,540
folks are spending a lot of money the

1044
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:48,340
thing about time is you could really

1045
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:51,250
dive a lot deeper into it and cover this

1046
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:52,630
for about couple days but without the

1047
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:55,360
video being shown and not being able to

1048
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:56,860
go there that's actually gonna wrap up

1049
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,050
my presentation before if we have some

1050
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:00,700
questions and answers so I wanted to

1051
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:02,650
descend with you made but delay but time

1052
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,540
will not I was a Benjamin Franklin quote

1053
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:08,290
he's also quoted as saying time is money

1054
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:11,230
which we appreciate a little bit more so

1055
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:12,890
from that do you guys have any questions

1056
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:18,670
or comments on the presentation good I

1057
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:18,670
[Music]

1058
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,960
think they just got more granular you

1059
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:30,759
know back in the day when they were

1060
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,680
doing leap seconds what type of systems

1061
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,200
that we had and what was the the need

1062
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,600
for accurate timing and now that we've

1063
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,970
got systems that you know that they're

1064
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,529
responding to the microsecond the leap

1065
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:43,060
second doesn't provide or the leap day

1066
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:44,410
doesn't provide the granularity they

1067
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:48,580
need in order to keep everything in sync

1068
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:50,049
you know and there's a yeah it's they

1069
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,340
can cause some problems and so some of

1070
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:53,470
the top minds in the world are saying

1071
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,610
just just deal with it you know in 300

1072
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:58,540
years we'll have a whole different set

1073
00:36:54,610 --> 00:37:00,040
of problems but that's like I said it

1074
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,509
almost becomes politics at that point

1075
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,820
then the UK wants to make sure Greenwich

1076
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:07,620
Mean Time stays Greenwich Mean Time and

1077
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,620
so they're all going back and forth you

1078
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:21,820
coming soon but we don't do too much

1079
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,710
with that I know that they were just

1080
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:25,210
talking about adjusting that which would

1081
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,590
kill a lot of the Europe just actually

1082
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,670
changed the way that they do that with

1083
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:31,060
the frequency right and it's killing

1084
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:33,010
everybody's VCR clock but no we tend to

1085
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:35,110
stay away from that there's all sorts of

1086
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:37,540
impulse systems and other legacy

1087
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:39,610
technology you can get into but we've

1088
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:41,500
chosen to just stay with you know modern

1089
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:45,720
network timing we do some amplitude

1090
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,720
modulation with various signals very

1091
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:01,029
[Music]

1092
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:09,479
the master clock ntp 100 I'm glad us yes

1093
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:12,089
so there's a like I said we'll use GNSS

1094
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,680
sync and you just pull you know from the

1095
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,240
very satellite constellations you get

1096
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,549
that time to about 20 nanoseconds

1097
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,069
there's also a something called NEMA Oh

1098
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:21,900
183 which is a marine electrical signal

1099
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:23,520
that there's a serial format that puts

1100
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,570
the actual time of date information on

1101
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:32,880
top of the frequency coming out of there

1102
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:36,260
yeah any other questions or comments or

1103
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,260
funny anecdotes about time when you get

1104
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,880
[Music]

1105
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:48,000
to be honest I'm not sure how they

1106
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:49,170
triangulated that I just so if you some

1107
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,060
of the stuff that they're doing for like

1108
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:53,610
GPS blocking antennas will do things

1109
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:55,259
like block the horizon you know they

1110
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:58,200
should be able to tell if you have you

1111
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:59,520
know multiple you know actually I'll

1112
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:09,899
have to look more into that I'm not sure

1113
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:15,030
exactly what they did okay that's bad

1114
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:21,480
timing for him always but intended high

1115
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:23,310
frequency of timing funds I mean there's

1116
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,750
even outside of jamming there's other

1117
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:26,880
issues that could happen to back in

1118
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:29,130
January 2016 they were decommissioning

1119
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,320
an old GPS satellite when they did a

1120
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:32,550
glitch of 13 millionths of a second was

1121
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,800
propagated through parts of the

1122
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:36,750
constellation shut down the BBC

1123
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,220
Broadcasting System their constraints on

1124
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,530
their broadcast transmission was 10

1125
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:42,089
microseconds some of the devices were 13

1126
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:44,340
microseconds off their whole network

1127
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:46,590
shut down doosh telecom went down for

1128
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,300
the same reason I mean these millionths

1129
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:54,670
of a second you know add up and really

1130
00:39:48,300 --> 00:40:01,030
screw people up it's a big deal

1131
00:39:54,670 --> 00:40:02,890
oh yeah the idea is if you can have a

1132
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:05,140
higher granularity to respond and you

1133
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:06,460
can kind of pay for one of those dark

1134
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,049
feeds or you pay a lot of money to get

1135
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,150
the information a little bit faster

1136
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:13,150
there is a Thomson Reuters had released

1137
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:15,010
a set of data 15 thousands of a second

1138
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:17,340
too early and 28 million dollar exchange

1139
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:18,460
hands because of that error I mean these

1140
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,050
algorithms

1141
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:22,420
everything is just based on time and

1142
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,950
trying to you know put in a big order

1143
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,210
and withdraw before the system can

1144
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:27,609
respond and you can end up basically

1145
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:28,900
shaking money out it's a it's incredible

1146
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:30,760
what they do and so we sell to both

1147
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,080
sides we sell to the folks that are

1148
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,330
trying to you know get ahead of the

1149
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,650
authorities and manipulate time and then

1150
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:37,000
we sell to the authorities too and try

1151
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:51,490
to have them go catch them so it's a

1152
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:56,050
it's good for us it's a big problem

1153
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:58,060
right now and one of the dip so they've

1154
00:40:56,050 --> 00:41:01,030
got something called sazon which is a

1155
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:02,470
secured GPS encrypted in listening mode

1156
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,880
I guess you could do and you have to go

1157
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:05,379
and register with the government proving

1158
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,670
out a bad actor and then you can

1159
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,230
essentially use a receiver that you

1160
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:10,780
could put codes and so that if they shut

1161
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:12,760
down GPS it's still active so they're

1162
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,870
very very careful with those codes the

1163
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,570
latest National Defense Authorization

1164
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:19,210
Act last year mandated that all future

1165
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:21,160
facing procurements use what's called M

1166
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,800
code M code is going to be the latest

1167
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:25,569
you know foolproof can't jam can do this

1168
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,040
and that they actually start getting

1169
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:29,230
into some of the quantum world with some

1170
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,940
of the calculations they do what we're

1171
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:33,130
doing at a practical level right now is

1172
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,360
we're we just implemented a receiver

1173
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:36,220
that can listen to all the different

1174
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,200
constellations we use what's called

1175
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:40,839
receiver autonomous integrity monitoring

1176
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,419
that looks at GPS looks at Galileo looks

1177
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:45,400
at Baidu and compares them and if one's

1178
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,900
being jammed or spoofed it can use the

1179
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,000
others to throw that out as an outlier

1180
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:51,280
if your entire system is being spoofed

1181
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,200
what we do is we detect that lack of

1182
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,240
available signal and we put a very

1183
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,649
accurate clock inside of our device

1184
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,680
whether it's a very accurate quartz

1185
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:01,210
crystal a rubidium atomic element and if

1186
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,490
we have a system that's an air-gapped

1187
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:04,870
Network and suddenly we initially got

1188
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:06,549
into it for the broadcasters that

1189
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:07,990
accidentally cut the GPS cable and you

1190
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:09,369
lose your GPS

1191
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:11,439
but now with intentional Jamie and

1192
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:13,119
spoofing the big money's going into how

1193
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,250
do you detect that and once you've

1194
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,800
detected it having enough holdover

1195
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:19,390
capability at the local device that you

1196
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:22,000
can maintain your tolerances until you

1197
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:23,259
can get GPS back in the mobile vehicles

1198
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,810
for instance over near the Korean

1199
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:27,700
Peninsula their GM and and spoof and

1200
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:29,349
everything and so what they're doing is

1201
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,419
on these drones they're using a

1202
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:33,000
combination of lidar with inertial

1203
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:35,619
measurement systems and other video

1204
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,540
capabilities and as long as you're able

1205
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:40,210
to keep time accurately onboard that

1206
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:41,950
devices in motion you can still navigate

1207
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:45,070
in a GPS tonight or in tested

1208
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:46,629
environment well actually the the first

1209
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,619
implementation we had that we had

1210
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,660
something to do with this was for

1211
00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:50,920
Universal Studios they've got a parade

1212
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,540
route where they got all the

1213
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,770
Transformers on these different floats

1214
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,450
and they have to interact to each other

1215
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,740
at certain points they were there

1216
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,689
putting our boxes on each of those

1217
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,310
floats to make sure that the floats and

1218
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:02,230
the automation systems are occurring at

1219
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:04,390
the exact same time and everything is in

1220
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:06,520
sync the problem was is there's a tunnel

1221
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:07,750
that the parade goes through and the GPS

1222
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,730
signals were bouncing around and

1223
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,290
confusing the receiver so we set our

1224
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:13,390
receiver with a limit that it'll only

1225
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:15,339
take certain adjustments up to a

1226
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:16,839
millisecond per second so if somebody

1227
00:43:15,339 --> 00:43:18,700
comes in and starts spoofing us at a

1228
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:20,349
rate beyond what we consider acceptable

1229
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,270
we just throw it out and use our

1230
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:24,520
internal timing but it was kind of

1231
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:26,259
ironic that the implementation we did to

1232
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:29,109
help Universal Studios run their parades

1233
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:33,400
is relevant to the military so put us in

1234
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:39,369
a good position any other questions or

1235
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:41,440
comments or all right folks we'll uh and

1236
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:42,849
in about nine minutes early so that's

1237
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,530
free time for me I hope you guys enjoy

1238
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:47,050
it if you guys have any questions where

1239
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:49,150
master o'clock calm I should have about

1240
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:51,040
us how did I get up here you know I'm a

1241
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:52,390
young guy I'm actually a second

1242
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,060
generation my parents mounted the

1243
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:57,190
company out of her garage at 1994 and

1244
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:58,960
then now my mom and I are running it we

1245
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:01,060
got twenty thirteen st. Charles employer

1246
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,849
of the Year 2014 Missouri exporter of

1247
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:05,680
the year 2016 we got a award from the

1248
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:07,810
Obama administration for our exports

1249
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,129
it's nice we make all this stuff over

1250
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:10,570
here in st. Charles you've got our own

1251
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:12,369
pick-and-place machines we're still

1252
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:14,770
building Hardware here we do all of our

1253
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:16,630
own coding so it's not you know being

1254
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:18,250
mass-produced somewhere else so we

1255
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:20,020
really have to dig down into the science

1256
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:21,770
and we're relied on to do everything

1257
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,600
from make sure you guys can fly out

1258
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:26,780
safely to make sure you can get time

1259
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:28,160
accurate on your cell phone so we're

1260
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,150
happy to do what we do we have a good

1261
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,520
time with it

1262
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:33,710
and a little bit about me president/ceo

1263
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,690
been working with the company since I

1264
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:37,160
could walk in with chief labor we're

1265
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:39,710
members of the Institute of navigation

1266
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,359
there's a group called the precise time

1267
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,650
and timing interval committee where we

1268
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,720
get together and talk about time and

1269
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:46,190
time intervals and it's a great time I'm

1270
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,140
probably the dumbest person on there's a

1271
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,860
lot of cool people and then st. Louis

1272
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,480
makes we're trying to bring

1273
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,830
manufacturing back so there's a good

1274
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,900
group called st. Louis makes the new

1275
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:56,029
factory tours so you can sign up go

1276
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,470
check out some cool manufacturing in the

1277
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:59,150
area meet some people

1278
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:01,490
we're definitely proud to support them

1279
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:02,780
so thank you guys very much I hope you

1280
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:05,589
guys enjoy the rest of the conference

1281
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,590
and thanks for your time

1282
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,520
[Applause]
