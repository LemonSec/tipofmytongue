00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:06,010
so why did we do this bro quick I wanna

46
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,080
just tell you why I've been to a lot of

47
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,420
conferences like some a lot of these

48
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,640
speakers have as well as a lot of the

49
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,859
attendees here have and when we started

50
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,478
this we really saw that there was two

51
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:21,160
types of cons going on there was the

52
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:23,110
community con besides def con or you

53
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,260
know Derby con and then we had some of

54
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,030
the more corporate ones we saw benefits

55
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,010
and downsides to both you know really

56
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,590
good talks at the community cons trying

57
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,870
to get your company to pay for it pretty

58
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,419
hard you know some of the other ones the

59
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:40,210
people pay to speak so you end up with a

60
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:43,180
commercial and we realized we found this

61
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,609
niche and and what we've really tried to

62
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,320
strive to do with Shomi con and I hope

63
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,960
that we're still doing it and please

64
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:55,780
tell me if we're not is we're kind of

65
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:58,690
keeping the corporate high-end feel as

66
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:01,270
well as getting good speakers in here

67
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,979
that can not only talk the real true

68
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,349
tech but give you stuff you can take

69
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:07,539
back to your work which i think is what

70
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:11,229
a lot of people want and a lot of people

71
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:14,909
are looking for and the fact that we ran

72
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:17,650
out of tickets yet again says it all so

73
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,630
we're going to start to move this to

74
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,799
other cities as well it's going to stay

75
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:25,599

00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:09,570
we strive to do is make everybody happy

92
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:14,640

whether you're an attendee whether

95
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:21,240
you're a sponsor or whether you're a

96
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:26,120
speaker and that's one of the things we

97
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:28,920
try to make sure that we do is that if

98
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:32,430
