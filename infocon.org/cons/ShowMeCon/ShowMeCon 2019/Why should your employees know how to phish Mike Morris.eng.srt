00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,010
I told you I was gonna yell sorry I'll

16
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,469
try to keep it down I was explaining to

17
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,269
him during the FBI career I was in too

18
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:52,199
many rooms where flashbangs went off and

19
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,570
it kills your ears so my ears are tough

20
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,539
here but thank you all for coming so

21
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,460
early this morning and I walked here and

22
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,500
I saw the two cars you look we're soul

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,390
sitting over there the two Mustangs were

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,519
still sitting there so I guess nobody in

25
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,180
the room here won the car so I hopefully

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:13,350
somebody all had a chance to try but

27
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,250
anyway so let's get going here so Who am

28
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,929
I

29
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,759
it was mentioned I did 25 years well

30
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,560
I'll start I'll start back a notch I

31
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,509
went got an undergraduate degree in

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,880
accounting a master's in system science

33
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:30,090
and I went to work for Price Waterhouse

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,320
as an accountant way back in the 80s

35
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,880
down in Miami when it's drug cartels and

36
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,100
did that for about a year and decided

37
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,530
that became a CPA and decided that

38
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,759
accounting was really really boring and

39
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,430
for any accountants out there I'm not

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,710
disparaging the career but it was not

41
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,810
for me and I always wanted to serve my

42
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,360
country I know it sounds corny but I

43
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,720
really did and what go look to go into

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,460
the military and at the time the the

45
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,880
military was rifting getting rid of a

46
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,579
lot of folks and so looked at the FBI

47
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:08,280
went into the FBI and was sent to Dallas

48
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:10,669
Texas and my career basically I did a

49
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,620
year of doing white-collar crime

50
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:16,040
investigations and nobody at the time

51
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,080
entire Bureau was working cybercrime and

52
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:22,409
I always had an interest in doing that

53
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,409
and my bosses didn't know anything about

54
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:27,298
a computer much less cybercrime and so

55
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:28,470
it was great because you start working

56
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:30,329
in those cases and you start talking

57
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,650
anything technical and they glass over

58
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:34,650
he had to meet with your boss every 90

59
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,409
days so they glass over and so so it

60
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,780
worked out well so I worked over my

61
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:41,879
career I worked doing several crime

62
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,670
investigations computer forensics and

63
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:46,950
tactical penetrations and on

64
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:50,040
counterintelligence cases and so what

65
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:53,010
that meant was on FISA warrants we would

66
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,540
go in and you know men and black we

67
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,940
would be the ones that go inside a place

68
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,590
and put mics and cameras and you know

69
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,780
tapping the computers my job was doing

70
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,940
forensics and playing data off of

71
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,010
computers and cellphones so that's what

72
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,109
I did with the government also did

73
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,659
investigations and investigated a lot of

74
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:10,980
hackers I'm loved a couple will talk

75
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:16,078
about a few of these cases here in a

76
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:18,630
minute and after I after I retired from

77
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:21,810
the FBI I went to work for back to work

78
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,720
for PwC as a manager over incident

79
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,660
response and Security Investigations and

80
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,239
insecurity was a road warrior for a

81
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,790
couple of years got tired of living out

82
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,950
suitcase and went to work for a energy

83
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,709
company client of mine as director of

84
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:44,879
security and did that for a couple of

85
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:46,500
years and then as a energy company and

86
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:51,060
when I joined it we're in bankruptcy and

87
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:53,010
so after two years they we got purchased

88
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,629
and those of you have ever worked for

89
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,448
our company in bankruptcy if you're the

90
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:58,768
company who gets purchased they what

91
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:00,599
happens is they give executive

92
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:02,959
leadership they say here's a great

93
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:06,690
severance package thanks for playing and

94
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,609
you know so I live in Dallas and so I

95
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,590
live in the East part of Dallas and most

96
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:12,150
of jobs were in the West and in the

97
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,370
north it's gonna be about an hour and a

98
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,070
half drive and I said well you know

99
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,829
after all this time in this career what

100
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,930
do I really really want to do and so I

101
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:23,430
decided I wanted to teach I did some a

102
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,920
lot of teaching to the State Department

103
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:30,670
and so I decided that I wanted to teach

104
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,440
and I came across I started researching

105
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:36,490
and I came across

106
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:38,620
WGU and a couple of things that really

107
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,890
pointed that you know really drove me to

108
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,050
it

109
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:44,440
one it was an online school completely

110
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,520
online started in 1997 you know just

111
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,940
think about what the internet looked

112
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,310
like in 1997 it's completely nonprofit

113
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,930
it was actually started by nineteen

114
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,930
governors who had a need to have

115
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:59,320
teachers and so they needed a way to

116
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:01,710
educate folks to become teachers and so

117
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:05,080
they came together formed a non-profit

118
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:09,099
it's been extremely successful low cost

119
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:13,300
affordable education we actually have a

120
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:15,160
affiliate school here in Missouri and so

121
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,370
I started with WGU as a course

122
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,010
instructor teaching cybersecurity in the

123
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,020
master's programs and then earlier this

124
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,150
year became the program chair meeting

125
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:31,270
I'm over the undergraduate cybersecurity

126
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:33,969
programs so that's me alright let's talk

127
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:36,609
a little bit about hackers hackers are

128
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:39,400
like intelligence officers so and I'm

129
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,700
I'm a big Walker I like to walk on the

130
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,200
stage but I'm going to stay over here

131
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,289
has everybody seen Jurassic Park at some

132
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:50,080
point in their life yes right well I

133
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,370
have a bottle of water up here okay and

134
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,940
it's sitting up on this next to this

135
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:56,710
podium and every time I walk the water

136
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,330
in there looks like a sea going back and

137
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,430
forth like this and this thing is

138
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,289
creaking and everything up here so I

139
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,150
think I've hit maximum density up here

140
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,770
on this on this stage so I'm going to

141
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,840
stay over close over here so that you

142
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:11,349
don't see me crash and burn up here on

143
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,969
stage and on camera so let's talk about

144
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,400
hackers

145
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:18,160
so again intelligence officers and

146
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,710
hackers both are highly intelligent they

147
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,180
really are they're very detail-oriented

148
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,650
and I'm not going to read down the

149
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,660
slides but you can see the different

150
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,900
things the great problem solves they're

151
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:31,510
very intelligent individuals now you're

152
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,909
asking me well how do I know so I'll

153
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:36,849
tell you about I'll tell you a case so

154
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:39,760
back in the early 90s has the first one

155
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:40,390
to actually develop a work with our team

156
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,020
of engineer

157
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:46,229
at Quantico and we developed a data

158
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:50,770
monitor and so what happened was we got

159
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:53,590
word from a source I had had a source in

160
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:55,690
the FBI when you're one of your KSA's if

161
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:58,359
you will is to develop and recruit

162
00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:01,270
individuals to become sources it's right

163
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,400
a source and he was a private detective

164
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,799
and he was approached by a group of

165
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,169
individuals who said we can get you any

166
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,150
information you need yeah if you want

167
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:13,900
phone numbers of folks you want phone

168
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:15,909
records you want as I guy so what and

169
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,530
then they started going any what you

170
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,370
want you want to have credit change do

171
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:21,130
you want to have your credit rating

172
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:24,970
change from a really bad really good we

173
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:26,710
can do that you want to have listed in

174
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:30,130
on phone calls anywhere in the anywhere

175
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,510
in the United States we can do that you

176
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,800
want to have and I can talk about this

177
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,870
because it's been out in public record

178
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,240
and on the news you want to have sprint

179
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,640
cards as many as you possibly want to

180
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,020
make phone calls we can do that I was

181
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,349
like okay it's getting better in case

182
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,849
looking a little bit better and he goes

183
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,800
oh yeah the other thing they had this

184
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:51,070
they said they have full access to the

185
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,900
system it's called NCIC and then they

186
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,599
can run criminal checks whenever they

187
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,640
want on anybody is that interesting I

188
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,860
said bingo you got it that's an

189
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:04,120
interesting case so we we started

190
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:06,040
looking at this group and we developed

191
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,410
probable cause and and so it's not like

192
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,090
TV to where you can just automatically

193
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,520
go and run and turn something on and

194
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:15,549
listen in on people or you know it takes

195
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,289
stacks of paper it takes probable cause

196
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,760
so you go to before a judge and they go

197
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:21,400
through everything you know and it's

198
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,930
it's a good process the individuals to

199
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,280
me you know the law enforcement side of

200
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,980
me wanted an immediate like they did on

201
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,140
TV the individual with me wanted no I

202
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:31,000
want the paper to be that tall you know

203
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,549
because I want to show that you really

204
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,440
have probable cause to go in there

205
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:37,919
anyway after going through that we

206
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,510
actually set up a data monitor and so

207
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:44,530
back in those days it would that first

208
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:47,319
one was a analog which meant that we had

209
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:49,990
to catch the phone line coming out of

210
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,840
the hackers house before it went to the

211
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,279
CEO we had to be somewhere in that loop

212
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:58,240
so we set up a

213
00:08:54,279 --> 00:09:02,860
from that from the CEO had the first

214
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:05,050
part of the phone phone company so we

215
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,879
caught the line coming in and so we were

216
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,579
able to put a monitor on that attack and

217
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,470
so we're then able to see everything

218
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:13,319
that they did all the keystrokes they

219
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,309
made all the companies they went into

220
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:17,920
meanwhile we also had all their phones

221
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:20,170
tapped and so as it got bigger and

222
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,180
bigger we talked more more phones and so

223
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,790
we're going across the country on this

224
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:27,729
and so it was very interesting to see

225
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,498
they had they ran it like a business and

226
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,930
they would actually have meetings every

227
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:34,449
week and they would go around the room

228
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:38,378
it was almost like a scrum meeting how

229
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:39,939
are you coming penetrating on AT&T well

230
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:42,759
I'm doing this I'm doing that well how

231
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:44,680
are you doing on penetrating sprint well

232
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:46,240
I'm working on this this and this how

233
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,739
are we doing on moving the cards and

234
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,389
they would run these meetings like this

235
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:53,920
and you know over these bridges and you

236
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:55,809
know it's very interesting to listen to

237
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,079
it's very interesting and they would

238
00:09:55,809 --> 00:10:01,779
work 18-hour days I mean honestly if

239
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:03,849
they spent that much time doing work

240
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:06,250
instead of hat you know instead of doing

241
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,779
bad work you know they'd be millionaires

242
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:11,559
you know so they did that it worked

243
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:14,170
really really hard sorry I'd take a

244
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:15,610
drink I figure if I keep drinking water

245
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:20,939
I'll go down too I can't see it and then

246
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:25,029
won't bother me when I walk around sorry

247
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:28,439
so back to the hacker group the one

248
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:31,300
thing that that they did not have was

249
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:33,969
discipline and what I meant by that they

250
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:37,779
were very very they're very very good at

251
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:40,179
their job they were very good at seeing

252
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:42,250
things that changed so for instance they

253
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:44,189
were paranoid if they heard if their

254
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,379
line had static had anything going on

255
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:49,000
they were their alert immediately and it

256
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:50,889
was interesting was that they would have

257
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,629
these meetings and ago they hear us a

258
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:54,850
pop or a noise it wasn't our so it's

259
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:57,399
just a pop or a noise online and they go

260
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:59,079
all the FBI is listening ha ha ha hey

261
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:00,550
FBI were hacking today and we're gonna

262
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:02,709
hack into this company this company this

263
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,599
company in this company and you know and

264
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:05,800
so which was great because in your

265
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,660
listening he's saying you know and so

266
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,699
you play it back for a juror you

267
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:13,240
Oh what do you know here there they're

268
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:17,170
saying this this this isn't this so the

269
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,160
discipline side you know as far as even

270
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,740
though they're very paranoid about

271
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,969
things they discipline side as I just

272
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,770
mentioned they talk about things they

273
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,420
probably should have said they were you

274
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:29,410
know they just were not disciplined

275
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:31,390
about that one of the things that was

276
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:34,240
very interesting on several of the

277
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:37,090
hacker cases that I worked was just like

278
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,300
a good intelligence officer very very

279
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:42,400
good at looking at people reading people

280
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,099
and motive and seeing what motivated

281
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,560
people and so they were very good at

282
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:51,310
seeing you know they get on the phone

283
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,260
and I don't work several cases with very

284
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:58,770
good people who did social engineering

285
00:11:53,260 --> 00:12:02,890
and like to gain information and so

286
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:04,360
these guys were the same way and so they

287
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,699
were very good at asking all the

288
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,410
questions and they would you know back

289
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:11,800
in the day to dumpster diving they would

290
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:13,420
they gather information and if I were to

291
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,310
call any of you on the phone right now

292
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,620
they're all in security or many of you

293
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,839
are in security you know if I started to

294
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,300
ask you you know three or four questions

295
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,250
hey yeah you know what's your job

296
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,420
position or you know what are you doing

297
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,860
with this or what are you doing with

298
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,420
that you know after about the second

299
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,760
question red lights beguiling Bing Bing

300
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:33,550
Bing and you hang up on me okay

301
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,170
but if I called you and I say hey it's a

302
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,000
large company I'm Joe and I'm working in

303
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,640
this apartment and I already knew the

304
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,500
department and I'm working on this

305
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,949
report and I knew the name of the report

306
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,540
and I'm trying to get into this and I'd

307
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,100
get one piece of information from you

308
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,569
and then I call the next person I gained

309
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,270
another piece of information from you

310
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:54,850
and so together all those pieces of

311
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,250
information allow them to get into into

312
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,650
a company via social engineering and so

313
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:05,110
that led them it would enable them to be

314
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:07,689
able to be very successful and that was

315
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,910
with you know that multiple individuals

316
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,200
one hacker who wrote a book and I can't

317
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:14,469
talk about his name but I'm on LinkedIn

318
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,890
with him that I worked on his case he

319
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,690
was an incredible social engineer he was

320
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,990
not good at I mean he wasn't bad at

321
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,670
hacking but he was that was

322
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:26,480
skill set his skill set was social

323
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:30,170
engineering and he could talk anybody

324
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,730
out about anything and so in Dallas

325
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:34,130
there is a large phone company that I

326
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:37,310
can't talk about but that manufactured

327
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:40,310
phones and this individual called them

328
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:41,810
up and we knew he was doing this and so

329
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,819
I was trying to get to the company I

330
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:47,479
always driving almost was lights on

331
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:48,649
trying to get there and he was able to

332
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,390
talk to company out of all the source

333
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:52,790
code the newest phone before he got

334
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:54,500
released and had it up on and had it in

335
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:58,819
and out you know in a matter of minutes

336
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:01,459
that's how good that person was so again

337
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:04,040
hackers are very good just like

338
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:05,569
intelligence officers about reading

339
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,520
people and knowing how to push the

340
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:12,709
buttons to generate the information that

341
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:14,180
they need get motivations you know a in

342
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:16,069
the early days really it used to be

343
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,449
knowledge the early ones really were

344
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,310
knowledge they wanted to go in and see

345
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:22,250
what they could do tester legs they

346
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:23,510
didn't have capture-the-flag events like

347
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,820
we do now they didn't have an

348
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:27,829
environment you know virtual environment

349
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,899
like we do now you know and so a lot of

350
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:31,609
the earlier ones were really just

351
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:38,810
experimenting and seeing what they could

352
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:42,200
do I had a an earlier one and the this

353
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:46,160
earlier case was one and phone company

354
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:49,040
company kept getting hacked and we

355
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,569
figured out who it was traced it down so

356
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,360
then it came time for my favorite time

357
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:55,100
to get on the car you know your young

358
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,380
FBI agent you have your code on here

359
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,579
gone on you have your partner there you

360
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,649
cut me a knock knock knock on the door

361
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:02,479
and then you you know pull out your

362
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:05,180
creds you know FBI

363
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,579
you know except I'm not gonna knock open

364
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,910
the door and there was a naval commander

365
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:13,219
in dress uniform I mean there's about

366
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,839

367
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,810

368
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:20,180
some event you go can I help you oh you

369
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:23,209
know like excuse me sir I'm with the FBI

370
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:25,579
and he was right here and I said well

371
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:27,619
we've found hacking going on here from

372
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:30,829
your residence and now it couldn't be I

373
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,030
have my son my son Tommy and and Tommy

374
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:35,010
has a computer I suppose

375
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,170
computer and what does he do with it all

376
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:39,240
he does is read it you know he reads

377
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,469
encyclopedias stuff and you know he

378
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,320
doesn't do too much stuff on it

379
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:45,540
okay let's talk to Tommy so if you don't

380
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,430
mind and so then it turns out we didn't

381
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:51,240
know how old Tommy was turned out he was

382
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:52,500
younger than we could prosecute so we're

383
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,510
talking with him and we laid all the

384
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,610
evidence and Tommy goes we're talking he

385
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:59,340
crumbles you know and then he tells the

386
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:01,020
story dad of course gets very mad and I

387
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,210
said sir you understand I said I can't

388
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,620
do anything to tommy federally but but

389
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,270
look you know there are local statutes

390
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,850
we could charge them with or civilly

391
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:10,260
they could do something with them and

392
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,570
it's totally up to you know up to you

393
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,700
and you guys agent Morris

394
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,990
because I promise you that I will take

395
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,120
care of this this will never happen

396
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:22,110
again hey you guys I give you our word

397
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:24,150
so ok so myself and my partner we're

398
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,710
walking out the door walking towards a

399
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,209
car and we're talking about how the

400
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:31,830
interview went you know and everything

401
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:33,780
and and all sudden boom crash bang all

402
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:37,800
this noise with cat-like reflexes yeah

403
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:41,660
right I wish I had but anyway with

404
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:44,219
cat-like reflexes we turned around and

405
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:47,670
Tommy lived on the second story of the

406
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,950
house so what happened was dad was true

407
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:52,349
to his word he gave excellent and

408
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:54,750
immediate parental supervision what he

409
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,790
did was open that window up and out went

410
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,530
the computer out went the monitor it all

411
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,980
went crashing down on the thing I mean

412
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:03,630
it was all over the place so so anyway

413
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,020
that was some Texas supervision there

414
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,880
but again he really the young man really

415
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,170
wanted to he was trying to learn that's

416
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,270
what he was trying to do was him trying

417
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,430
to his motivation was not to gain money

418
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:17,129
the other group I mentioned their

419
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:19,530
motivation started originally for

420
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,180
knowledge and then it went through hey I

421
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:24,810
got all this power I have all this

422
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:27,600
control they had stars that they didn't

423
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:29,580
like when like Kurt Cobain died they

424
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,110
were mad at different individuals and so

425
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,760
they turned off their phones or listen

426
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:35,969
to phone calls and do all these things

427
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:38,250
and they were very angry about that

428
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,720
then it became a matter of money how

429
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,310
could they make money and they were

430
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,390
selling credit those sprint cards I

431
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:46,360
mentioned actually went got sold from

432
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,120
Dallas Texas

433
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,500
to Switzerland to Italy and there used

434
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,668
by the mob and it was funny it's like

435
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,799
multi-level marketing

436
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:56,230
they got 50 cents a card the next guy I

437
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:58,620
got the dollar card next guy got $2 of

438
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:02,700
cards so it's very interesting

439
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:05,500
hacker education mostly is self-taught

440
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,179
you know now of course nowadays there

441
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,519
were pin test courses and everything out

442
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:10,990
there doesn't mean turns you into it

443
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:15,940
evil hacker just means you're gaining

444
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:20,559
knowledge let's talk about the defenders

445
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:22,919
the other side of the Hat so as a sorry

446
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,918
I got a

447
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:41,110
it's still rattling up here though it

448
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,870
takes more water sorry the other side of

449
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:48,580
the Hat from both the FBI perspective

450
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:51,549
and the and the PwC perspective we would

451
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:54,279
come into companies the barn has burned

452
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:56,289
down the doors of the crowd open the

453
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:59,110
cows have all gone you know bad things

454
00:18:56,289 --> 00:19:01,149
have already happened okay and so then

455
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,709
when you start digging into it we had a

456
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:07,059
speaker yesterday that we went over

457
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,850
policies how you know having policies

458
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:12,490
not having policies you know almost

459
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,658
every single time you find that they had

460
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,830
it I said what was your policy do you

461
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:16,630
guys have your policies in place this is

462
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:18,549
after you put out the fire after you've

463
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:22,769
figured out you know stop the bleeding

464
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:25,240
you know you're now trying to fix things

465
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:27,309
you look at it in there there is no

466
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,860
policy so there is no procedures they

467
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:31,000
they didn't have that in place the other

468
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,490
things that you then we start dating

469
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,250
really digging into it you know you had

470
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:39,760
staffs that had you know they're they're

471
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:41,980
working for paychecks obviously they're

472
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,649
a lot of times it's a store overworked a

473
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:48,610
lot of times the security staff was

474
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:50,889
really the IT staff who was also had

475
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,178
five of their hats so wearing I'm sure

476
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,379
several people in the room have heard

477
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:57,250
that you know to have lived that

478
00:19:53,380 --> 00:20:00,010
experience you know at the time you know

479
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,960
until something bad happens you know

480
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,190
security is an afterthought I mean they

481
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,659
don't really think about it a lot of

482
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,149
times the board doesn't think about it

483
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:08,830
until they had the major boom you know

484
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:11,049
as did the major boom then the door is

485
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:12,580
open and all the money flows in and

486
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:14,470
you're able to actually fix things and

487
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:23,230
do things that you'd want to do ahead of

488
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:25,299
time so you know as far as trying to

489
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,700
take control of an organization and

490
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:30,129
handle a lot of things it's tough you

491
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:32,049
know defenders face a whole litany of

492
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:36,279
items that they're trying to protect

493
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:38,019
against and one of the hardest ones is

494
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:41,080
insider attacks I'll tell you two very

495
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:45,399
quick ones on insider attacks the first

496
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:48,220
one was a sysadmin for a company that

497
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:51,309
worked in Dallas who was in over customs

498
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,690
and in customs what I mean by customs

499
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:55,480
they handled all the custom paperwork

500
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,289
all over the world and so without this

501
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,419
paperwork

502
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:59,200
bananas didn't ship without this

503
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:01,900
paperwork

504
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,970
Toyota's didn't ship and so what

505
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:06,700
happened was this guy was an ass was a

506
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:09,100
horrible individual harassed the the

507
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:12,880
female staff at the company was fired

508
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:15,389
and before he fired we're actually they

509
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,980
fired him but they left his access up

510
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:20,820
the left so he was able to log back in

511
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:25,330
he changed two lines of code and

512
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:28,510
everything stopped for two weeks so now

513
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:30,428
it went from being a you know HR

514
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:33,549
incident to now the company's gonna owe

515
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:36,309
millions of dollars multiple millions of

516
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:38,559
dollars to companies all over the world

517
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:39,010
because they can't ship as they're

518
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,280
supposed to

519
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:44,740
you know bananas rotted Toyota's sat

520
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,809
there rusted you know everything stopped

521
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:49,840
all because of two lines of code all

522
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:53,320
because he left his access up you know

523
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:57,299
and so that was one insider case another

524
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:59,830
insider case this was not a federal case

525
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:01,900
this was somebody called me when my

526
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:04,600
friends called me and said hey I got a

527
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,400
situation we have a civil case going on

528
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,689
and I said well I can't work on civil

529
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,630
cases and you go I just want your

530
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:13,600
opinion was okay so tell me the story so

531
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:16,600
the story is this a large corporation in

532
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:20,918
Dallas a multinational corporation

533
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:22,899
Dallas fired a vice president because he

534
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:25,120
was searching pornography on the

535
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,100
internet not child porn but just

536
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:31,389
pornography well-laid their policy they

537
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:34,360
fired him boom he had the newest nicest

538
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:35,710
computer anybody Hayao in that area had

539
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,770
it was sitting there saying he got

540
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:41,320
walked out the computer sat there so

541
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:43,450
nobody took it nobody took any forensics

542
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,020
on it nobody took any copies of anything

543
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:48,370
they just fired him boom out the door

544
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,830
six months go by and what happened

545
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:52,689
during that period was Joe down the hall

546
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:54,699
decided hey you know that computer and

547
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:56,409
monitors better than anything I have he

548
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,059
took it went down the street went down

549
00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:01,720
to his desk put it up he started using

550
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:03,279
it six months go by the guy he got

551
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,100
is now on the golf course with his

552
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:08,350
attorney playing golf and he goes yeah I

553
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,269
was wronged I was really wronged in and

554
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:12,428
he goes the attorney goes well I'll look

555
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:16,389
into it so now they're asking for

556
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:19,419
evidence well there is no evidence will

557
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:22,240
show me the pictures well we don't have

558
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:23,559
any pictures well show me the computer

559
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,230
let my forensic expert look at the

560
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:29,168
computer well it's been used by people

561
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:33,250
since you know for six months we know we

562
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:36,399
don't have that the result anybody want

563
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:39,460
to guess the end result was that large

564
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:41,889
company wrote a substantial check to

565
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:44,860
that individual so even though he was a

566
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:46,570
it was a again a horrible human he made

567
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,490
a lot of money because the company

568
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,809
didn't do their job didn't file they had

569
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,870
policies that said that they would do

570
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:55,059
this and they didn't follow the policies

571
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:56,739
why the staff was overworked

572
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:58,240
they didn't they're overworked they

573
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,769
didn't have time to follow it they

574
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,299
didn't think about it they just wanted

575
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:02,919
to get you know get on with it

576
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:09,779
and so that was several million dollars

577
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:12,039
that went down the defenders education

578
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:16,659
and this is what I want to talk about a

579
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:18,820
little bit now education as far as why

580
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:22,539
does a lot of the companies a lot of the

581
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:25,240
lower levels start positions help desk

582
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:27,370
self-taught individuals you know as you

583
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,000
move up in the organization usually your

584
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:33,000
education does to your your either your

585
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,309
flight time on the keyboard your

586
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:41,049
learning your certifications you know go

587
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:43,240
up but again there's no well most

588
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:47,100
organizations do not have a formal plan

589
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:49,029
as far as how do they ate their folks

590
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,969
you know and the other issue that we

591
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:57,279
have is that there is as everybody knows

592
00:24:51,970 --> 00:25:00,490
there is a large void of skilled workers

593
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:02,649
and the cybersecurity field there truly

594
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:06,879
is and so that if it is it's going to

595
00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:08,949
bite us before it's over well so one of

596
00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:13,869
the things that the federal government

597
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:15,460
did NIST way back in 2008 they came up

598
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:18,070
and they said hey we have a problem

599
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,480
we know that we don't have the employees

600
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:23,889
that we need we know there's going to be

601
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:27,600
a shortfall 2010 they form the national

602
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:29,950
initiative for cyber education nice and

603
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,730
they said you know what we need to do is

604
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:37,480
we need to work together with government

605
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:40,929
industry education and come up with a

606
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:43,000
way to educate individuals and make sure

607
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:45,490
that we have a actually a framework in

608
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,279
place so that people can move from the

609
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:50,230
helpdesk position to the CSO position

610
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:56,169
how do we do that how do we get that

611
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:58,480
going so they came through and again

612
00:25:56,169 --> 00:25:59,649
they can't see with this framework and

613
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,110
it what it does it does a couple

614
00:25:59,649 --> 00:26:06,719
different things one it gives employers

615
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:09,639
an idea of what jobs do you need to fill

616
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,179
what skill sets those individuals need

617
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:17,230
to have what types of knowledge and

618
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:19,779
abilities they need to have and you know

619
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:22,029
to fill that role so it's great for it

620
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:23,529
is great for interviewing from an M you

621
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:26,140
know it's also great from growing your

622
00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:28,059
staff up from an employee side of the

623
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:30,940
house or for people who are thinking

624
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:34,960
about coming in it's good because it

625
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:36,820
allows them to have this this mapped out

626
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,779
framework of how do they get from where

627
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:42,158
they are now to the job that they want

628
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:48,100
and the nice framework there if you look

629
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:49,450
up so they have category it's a work

630
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,279
category we're going to talk about I'll

631
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,809
show you a graphic here in a minute goes

632
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:56,020
down to a specialty area with multiple

633
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:59,740
special areas breaks down to a work role

634
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:03,760
I type a type of job and then it goes

635
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:07,210
over the KSA's and the tasks now the

636
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,710
reason this is so important is and you

637
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,429
can start looking at the tasks that

638
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,809
they're where I'm talking in the

639
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:13,539
category the workforce categories up

640
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:16,029
there there's seven of them but the

641
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:19,840
reason this is so important is that if

642
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:23,200
all of us can agree that you know

643
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:26,770
something that a job is if specific job

644
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,299
requires these specific knowledge and

645
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,500
bit and abilities and they're gonna

646
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:31,360
perform these types of

647
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,790
we can all talk about the same thing

648
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,770
we're all talking the same language if

649
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:37,480
we're not doing that was kind of like

650
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:39,280
the blind men touching an elephant

651
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,900
trying to figure out okay the elephant

652
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,840
looks like a snake no he looks like a

653
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:45,280
bull no it looks like this and to that

654
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:47,379
so the work roles we have have broken

655
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,020
down that they came up with securely

656
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:52,290
provision operate maintain overseeing

657
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:56,670
govern and you can read through there

658
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:59,110
protecting defend analyze collect and

659
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:01,600
investigate so those are the major

660
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:04,179
workforce categories and under each of

661
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,459
those has specially roles especially

662
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:09,970
areas work roles and tasks that they

663
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:13,540
perform as an example so let's talk

664
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:15,100
about the work category is securely

665
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,770
provision other if you can see it up

666
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:21,330
there and try to highlight it and the

667
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:24,129
special area is is systems architecture

668
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:25,780
okay so you could go in there and you

669
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,400
can look and say okay if I want to be if

670
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,379
I need to get on systems architect or I

671
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,090
want to become a systems architect how

672
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:34,120
do I do that what what do I have to have

673
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:37,300
and so it kind of walks you through

674
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,219
so first is knowledge so knowledge is

675
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,680
what if I gained you know what knowledge

676
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,910
do I have and so you can see up there

677
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,350
know if you can read way back in the

678
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,850
back back there but it talks about your

679
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,139
knowledge of computer networking you

680
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:49,060
know and it walks through a whole list

681
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:53,860
this is a partial list for that job role

682
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:56,470
there are multiple long lists there the

683
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:59,260
next thing is skills skills are what you

684
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:59,950
can do tactically what can you hands-on

685
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,379
keyboard

686
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:04,450
okay what do you what can you do you

687
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:06,100
know and so it breaks down and you know

688
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:08,910
as far as you know what skills do you

689
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:11,550
have to have to be a systems architect

690
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:14,190
you know then then it goes down to

691
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:17,020
abilities and abilities are

692
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:19,120

shows you have this and then it gets

695
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:31,000
down to tasks what tasks you have to

696
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:33,580
complete in order to do your job and a

697
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,980

705
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,250
with water you need to know how to dry

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,439
it you know how to do the wheels so each

707
00:29:53,250 --> 00:30:00,600
one of those is a work task same thing

00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,490
a look at it out there one of the things

712
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,590
that they did is they work to a

713
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:13,440
partnership with burning glass and with

714
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:15,570
Katia under a federal grant and they

715
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,260

look at that site it's an excellent site

719
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:27,600
it's interactive you can actually I

720
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,730
pulled up Missouri just so you can see

721
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,918
here but you can click on any state

722
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:34,320
there and it'll go through and it'll

723
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,450
tell you how many folks that they they

724
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,789

00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:41,700
skill it'll tell you how many openings

726
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:44,129
there are in that state for that job

727
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:46,320
skill it'll talk about where they are

728
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:49,230
where the state is as far as you know so

729
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,450
right now I'm Missouri has a very low

730
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:53,970
number of folks in the Java skills so

731
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:56,279
there are actually understaffed if you

732
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:59,309

and you could type in a job you can type

738
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:12,720
in a category a job those one of those

739
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:14,669
one of those specialty areas that I

740
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,250
mentioned or a work role that I

741
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:20,610
mentioned you could type it in and then

742
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:23,190
you can see how many job openings are

743
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:25,080
are nationally you can see the skills

744

that the top skills that are requested

745
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:31,320
to fill that job you can then see you

746
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:33,899
know what they do common titles for that

747
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:41,610
job and the certifications they look for

748
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:42,330
for that type of job as far as I'm gonna

749
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:49,110
go back one

750
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:51,000
as far as knowledge goes you know a lot

751
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:53,820
of us really push ourselves every day to

752
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,350
learn something new a lot of times we

753
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,179
have staff that do this it was just

754
00:31:55,350 --> 00:32:00,290
excellent

755
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:02,930
a lot of times we have staff that don't

756
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:06,470
do that and we have to encourage them

757
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:09,260
and education could come in many forms

758
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:13,970
you know education can be formal

759
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:15,790
education education could be online

760
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:19,420
courses you know that you take in

761
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:21,889
certification courses that you take in

762
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:24,620
you know again it comes in many forms

763
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:26,360
and so I would HIGHLY encourage like I

764
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:28,489
said I would highly encourage you to

765
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,860
look at the nice framework I'd highly

766
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:33,980
encourage you to push yourself push your

767
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:36,709
staff to stay on top of the curve to

768
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:39,680
stay current and everything so that you

769
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:46,280
can again help yourself and help your

770
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:49,070
help your companies as far as as far as

771
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:53,450
the the hacker side goes and the fishing

772
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:56,450
side goes now as far as that's where

773
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:57,950
education comes back into play you know

774
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:01,250
you always hear the story you know you

775
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:03,920
if you give a person a fish you know

776
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:07,430
they can eat for a day if you teach them

777
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:10,670
how to fish you know they can eat for a

778
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:12,920
lifetime so as far as that's education

779
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:14,630
so again if you can you know learn how

780
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,880
to fish you know I mean if you can if

781
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:20,140
you can learn how to do it as education

782
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:23,150
you'll be very successful now as far as

783
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:26,420
what does all this really mean I've

784
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:32,120
talked about hackers I've talked about

785
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:35,210
staff and what happens and so if people

786
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:38,000
don't have the education to do their

787
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:40,520
jobs you know then it's an open field

788
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,240
day for whether it's a state-sponsored

789
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:46,670
attack an internal attack you know it

790
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,470
can absolutely happen because they

791
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:51,140
haven't followed either policy procedure

792
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:52,550
they haven't had the education to follow

793
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:55,160
policy procedure or they don't have the

794
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:57,860
education to keep up and do their jobs

795
00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:00,680
so it makes it tough with that that's

796
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:06,229
all I have I'm actually talked to faster

797
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:08,899
on my speech any questions about hacking

798
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:12,319
about the FBI

799
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:20,888
education please feel free to throw them

800
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:20,889
out must be one question anybody yes sir

801
00:34:30,549 --> 00:34:37,339
yes thank you thank you yeah going back

802
00:34:35,509 --> 00:34:39,829
15 years ago you had self-taught

803
00:34:37,339 --> 00:34:41,599
individuals you know that that rose

804
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:44,149
through the head field time they could

805
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,889
have been sucide mins and they're

806
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:47,929
interested in security and so they kind

807
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:50,690
of learned it on their own they went out

808
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:53,829
there and it did it on their own now

809
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:56,059
we're seeing companies go forth and

810
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:57,739
we're seeing individuals you know

811
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:59,900
understand that education is important

812
00:34:57,739 --> 00:35:02,239
we're seeing companies sponsor education

813
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,680
which is excellent you know they

814
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:05,630
understand they have to grow their

815
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,730
people up you know grow them up from the

816
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:10,549
from the troops up all the way up so

817
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:12,920
just as technology changes you know

818
00:35:10,549 --> 00:35:15,079
education if you're in security this is

819
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,420
a lifelong thing you have to learn to

820
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:20,089
fish you can't just eat a fish it is a

821
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:24,019
lifetime lifetime thing skills are gonna

822
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:25,880
change example technology I started the

823
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:29,118
FBI when I first my first cyber security

824
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,819
case I went out and got undercover IDs

825
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,890
and in my undercover IDs I went and went

826
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:36,558
to schools universities and I got

827
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:38,808
dial-up accounts okay because at that

828
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:40,670
back time the dark ages for those of you

829
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:42,319
with gray hairs you remember it was

830
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:43,609
dial-up so you notice they use dial-up

831
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:46,730
sand then what you got out there you

832
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:49,279
could do FTP somewhere and my first case

833
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:51,650
is that I started working were on

834
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:52,880
copyright infringement cases bulletin

835
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,470
boards raise hands how many gray hairs

836
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,150
have to remember bulletin boards all

837
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:59,749
right there you go

838
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:01,279
so my early cases was we're working

839
00:35:59,749 --> 00:36:04,160
bulletin boards since I first started

840
00:36:01,279 --> 00:36:06,410
and so I'd find out about you know these

841
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,170
boards and so for those of you without

842
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:11,359
gray hair who haven't think so both the

843
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:13,579
boards where I were a server sitting in

844
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,558
somebody's house sitting there that

845
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:17,809
there someplace sitting sitting there

846
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:21,259
with multiple phone lines running into

847
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:22,280
it and they would actually there are two

848
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:24,680
types of boards there

849
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,000
boards where you would upload so much

850
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,580
and you get credit then you could

851
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,170
download so much if you're an auntie

852
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:32,060
artist you know if you do hide to an see

853
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:33,350
art you know you're a rock star back

854
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,970
then you know if you could make some

855
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:38,150
cool and see graphic yeah yeah you

856
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:40,160
rocked it so it gave you more access so

857
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:42,860
you could download download more things

858
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,170
we never touched we never touched trade

859
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:48,020
boards unless it was trading in child

860
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:49,670
pornography we went after the boards

861
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,500
that were paid if there's a pay board

862
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:54,500
you know and they're selling auto cad

863
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:57,740
for $5 a copy or something out there we

864
00:36:54,500 --> 00:37:00,410
went after it and so that's how I

865
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:02,660
started and so again I told you part of

866
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:04,640
that part of the job is that developing

867
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,710
sources so if I could you know get

868
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,270
somebody who was in doing copyright

869
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:10,340
stuff but I also knew a hacker group

870
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:12,860
that was a plus you know so we started

871
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:15,590
working those kinds of things but that

872
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:17,390
was again that's the technology so it

873
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:20,000
you know staying on top of technology as

874
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:23,089
technology progressed from dial ups now

875
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,440
to digital and in the web and different

876
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:26,570
deliveries and different different

877
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,920
methods and ways they're getting in you

878
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:29,750
know were able to break into different

879
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,770
services that have been introduced you

880
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:33,890
know if you don't stay on top it at

881
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:35,270
education you know to protect it then

882
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:36,799
you're gonna get hacked by it and you're

883
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,460
gonna learn learn it through you know

884
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,650
how to write a check

885
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,510
just like ransomware you know talking

886
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:44,150
about you know your has same thing there

887
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:45,350
so thanks for that question and thank

888
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:51,310
you all for coming today I know it's

889
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:51,310
early so any other questions yes sir

890
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:09,810
and existing employees and it seems to

891
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:17,520
me they want you to walk in the door

892
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:19,650
right yeah the question was in the back

893
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,630
or we're seeing trends changes and

894
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:24,930
companies wanting to educate their

895
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:26,340
employees that currently they want that

896
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,890
you come in the door with those skill

897
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:33,090
sets you know versus being able to grow

898
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:34,200
up we are seeing and so wgo not sales

899
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,870
pitching but I'm just telling you what I

900
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,939
know so WGU partners with several

901
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:41,069
companies to provide exactly that type

902
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:44,400
of training and so let's say that your

903
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:46,350
company has a real need for going back

904
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,960
to the nice framework let's say that you

905
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:50,850
have a company that has a real need for

906
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,920
network you know network administrators

907
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:56,069
or systems administrators or whatever

908
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:59,430
your your your need is we can develop

909
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:01,140
programs for them working with them and

910
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:02,819
so they actually offer that as a benefit

911
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:05,250
to their employees and so we're seeing

912
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:07,680
more and more companies because again

913
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:09,510
it's kind of like you know there's only

914
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,700
you know you there's five people out

915
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:13,380
here okay well you can only offer so

916
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,120
much money or so many this that or

917
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,220
whatever and then they're gone but I

918
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,950
still need another ten so if you don't

919
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,810
grow them from within you know as a you

920
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:24,569
know as a benefit you know help help you

921
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:26,640
know do that you know then it's tough

922
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:29,250
you know you know obviously it gets back

923
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,450
to I think we're talking yes you were

924
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,400
walking in talking about you know

925
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:35,160
security is an afterthought you know

926
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,770
with a lot of companies security is cost

927
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,330
Center okay where's the profit and

928
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:41,430
security there is no profits here it's a

929
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:45,569
cost center pay us you know what they

930
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:46,890
generate you know so so again you know

931
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:48,240
security is a lot of times it's an

932
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:50,129
afterthought you know that you know they

933
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,470
don't want to pay for security until the

934
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:54,720
incident until you have the insider who

935
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:57,359
steals something until you have the

936
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,740
hacker who hacks in and takes this large

937
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,530
database and now you're on the national

938
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:03,089

943
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:13,220
