1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:07,259
okay red teamers I don't identify with

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,610
colors because I'm asked to do

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,509

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:14,790
there we go those are my people so

5
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:18,000
welcome to this talk we're going to talk

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,490
today about a very highly fictitious

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,390
definitely never happens story about a

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,038
disruption of a business caused by what

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,210
looked to be a ransomware ended up being

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,170
a little bit more complicated than that

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:35,460
but um yeah we're just going to roll

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,320
into it and if you have any seen

13

they're all posted already it's gonna be

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,350
up on Adrian's site iron geek if you

21
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,890
guys haven't been there already check it

22
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:59,460
out there's tons of talks out there so

23
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:02,989
as I mentioned very can't walk through

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,010
there these are real life situations

25
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:08,729
we're talking about small businesses

26
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,619
schools charities basically any business

27
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,970
that has underfunded IT I think we've

28
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,670
all been there at least once in their

29
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,590
career if we're not there already if we

30
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:21,330
have underfunded IT chances are we have

31
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,560
non-existent security and just to drive

32
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,400
this point home a little bit anybody

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,130
involved in not Pat yeah 2017 yeah it

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,380
was terrible White House has estimated

35
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:36,149
about ten billion dollars of impact from

36
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:38,699
that single breach anybody on the

37
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,229
Twitter followed via female they were

38
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,689
very transparent about one of their

39
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,329
breaches so if you're reading through

40
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,470
this basically attacker got a full

41
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,720
control of their environment and just

42
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,920
started right now zeros to everything

43
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,090
that they had we're talking about

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,090
backups we're talking about production

45
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:58,170
systems and they weren't able to recover

46
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,930
most of their clients emails just

47
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,350
recently in the news anybody know this

48
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,430
nineteen oh seven oh eight its RDP

49
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,190
unauthenticated so these things

50
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,840
to happen I'd say I don't know how to

51
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,880
drive home that point more breaches

52
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,660
happen if you haven't been breached you

53
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,640
probably just don't know about it so I

54
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,590
got a very hypothetical situation

55
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,179
because I'm most likely under NDA for

56
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:26,250
most of these stories so you get a

57
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,050
message from your boss

58
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,780
hey take a look at the network some

59
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:37,410
stuff isn't working you log onto a

60
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:43,209
server sees see something like that

61
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:48,070
maybe it looks like that would anyone

62
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:52,720
see this one before we haven't worked

63
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:55,140
together before have we some cases you

64
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,140
just see this

65
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:02,110
so what do we do we look for dancing and

66
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,840
response playbook now remember

67
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:06,700
underfunded IT into the response yeah we

68
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,890
know it's important we just haven't got

69
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,950
around to it yet we we should have one

70
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,730
photo all right cool it disaster

71
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,619
recovery

72
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,170
you got playbook oh yeah we did that on

73
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,730
a whole bunch of times yeah Jim five

74
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,470
years ago he ran a wonderful test

75
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:23,320
brought up the business in some other

76
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,540
location excellent where's the binder

77
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,680
whoa we don't have a binder okay cool

78
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:31,620
can you tell me where Jim that's well

79
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,620
Jim retired four years ago wonderful

80
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,970
we got any system documentation does

81
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:39,189
anybody know how these systems were

82
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,439
built well we usually use integrators

83
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:43,540
and we have outsourcers we come in and

84
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:53,769
then Jim runs them well great Jim's gone

85
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:55,060
guys so here we go so yeah again in

86
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:56,860
these situations have been part of

87
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,280
multiple the stories the same across

88
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:02,319
everything so attacker landed and he

89
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,750
just wiped everything right so we're at

90
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,488
scorched earth we have nothing

91
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:09,400
dr p maybe it exists on the file share

92
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:12,400
that is also gone so we gotta remember a

93
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:16,000
few things first before we start stole a

94
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,608
few quotes from our armed forces first

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,820
one is slow is smooth smooth is fast

96
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:23,349
we don't have times to screw up here so

97
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,969
does anybody know how long their

98
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:31,479
business can stay down before they

99
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:31,900
declare bankruptcy anybody yes three

100
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,449
days

101
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,880
wonderful all right for everybody else

102
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:41,860
that doesn't know use two weeks as a

103
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:45,659
barometer why two weeks oh you guys are

104
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:48,099
quiet there's coffee outside yes

105
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,750
paychecks exactly employees get paid

106
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:51,340
every two weeks if you're not paying

107
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,289
your employees it's really hard to run a

108
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,070
business because those employees leave

109
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:58,060
quickly

110
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:59,949
right second point here is this is gonna

111
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,479
be awful I'm not gonna lie

112
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:03,820
this is some of the worst experiences

113
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,050
I've ever had in my life but um the

114
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,159
bright side you can say I'm the

115
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,669
conference's and talk about your

116
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,949
terrible experiences so the very first

117
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:13,448
thing that we need to do chances are

118
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:15,820
we're in this situation we don't have a

119
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:17,860
dedicated incident response team go

120
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,469
engage one now here's a tip that I

121
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,659
learned have your legal counsel engaged

122
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,090
the incident response team now I'm not a

123
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:26,919
lawyer I don't pretend to be even but

124
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,510
there's some realities here if your

125
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:30,940
legal counsel engages the incident

126
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,409
response team instead of IT various

127
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,180
things are not discoverable in court

128
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:36,039
because chances are you're going to

129
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,490
court at some point related to this

130
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,139
incident

131
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,639
so have

132
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:43,180
illegal people involved from the very

133
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:46,509
beginning some quick quick story

134
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:49,120
so header breach everything's gone

135
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:51,400
backups are gone and about three years

136
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,279
later got subpoenaed to court for some

137
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,198
email systems from six years ago because

138
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:59,219
statues limitation seven years they can

139
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:02,560
call that back we don't have those

140
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:05,319
however since we had legal counsel

141
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,150
incident response teams evidence we had

142
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:08,560
law enforcement involved it was

143
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,120
dismissible in court because we

144
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,860
literally didn't have them we had due

145
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,599
diligence and we just didn't have the

146
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,789
email so we didn't get penalized for

147
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:19,080
that

148
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:21,539
so we have legal engaged we're breathing

149
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:25,389
we've already accepted our life sucks

150
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:27,400
what do we do so we basically have a

151
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:29,710
dying patient on our hands so we need to

152
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,539
ask ourselves a few questions what do we

153
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,549
know how do we stop this from getting

154
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:38,050
worse and how do we make sure we don't

155
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:40,150
screw it up even more so now I've worked

156
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,580
for you before this is not your

157
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,169
environment everybody thinks save us

158
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,339
snowflake environment everybody's

159
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:48,250
environment looks the exact same

160
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:50,289
there's some legacy windows there's some

161
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,360
clients there's this really dusty

162
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:53,919
machine over there it says IBM on its

163
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,589
either and as400 a mainframe I don't

164
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,210
care what it is but um you got some

165
00:06:56,589 --> 00:07:00,430
stuff in the cloud because cloud is cool

166
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,469
cloud is sexy but we just can't figure

167
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,419
out how to migrate this one machine over

168
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:08,490
there so you know it's an XP box it's

169
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:08,490
sitting there sorry we got the Internet

170
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,810
so where do we sit now huh well we know

171
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:17,649
what everything is impacted here the IBM

172
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:19,569
stuff it's still chugging we're seeing

173
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:20,889
some c2 traffic leave the server

174
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:22,539
environment we're seeing it on the

175
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:25,659
client environment we're starting to see

176
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:26,979
machines disappear off the network if

177
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:29,649
you've ever worked the ransomware case

178
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:32,529
if you're in the office and you can see

179
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:34,779
all your computers you just see screens

180
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:35,919
start going black left and right and

181
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:39,550
people are kind of looking up and around

182
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,560
so as clients are coming online they're

183
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,750
coming right back offline so some of

184
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,290
them are infected person on vacation for

185
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:54,270
two weeks not infected yet

186
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:56,990
so interactive time what do we do turn

187
00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:01,109
things off alright

188
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:02,870
hibernating print resumes that is the

189
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,100
number one response that I usually hear

190
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:11,790
problem is it was on your shared file

191
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:15,240
that is also encrypted isolate nodes

192
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:16,800
excellent how we doing that Network

193
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:22,590
isolation start turning off your routing

194
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:25,230
write us we got it oh you guys are

195
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,700
really quiet again coffee the monster

196
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:30,030
people are also out there if you don't

197
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:35,490
like coffee there's monster alright I've

198
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:37,350
also heard cry so here's a couple ideas

199
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,750
right we can disconnect the internet we

200
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:42,270
can disconnect in between routing right

201
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,890
we can disable users at this point we're

202
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,990
not sure exactly what happened let's

203
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,670
disable everybody can we disconnect the

204
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,980
cloud because the cloud looks ok

205
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,930
do we want to power down the IBM stuff I

206
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,540
mean that's usually where the data is

207
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,560
let's make sure that that's ok all right

208
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,030
you're gonna list out all these

209
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,550
different things that we could possibly

210
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,680
do and then we're gonna talk about the

211
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,719
negatives of doing it so if we

212
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,010
disconnect the ERP systems we have no

213
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,090
business transactions we're dead in the

214
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:11,000
water right if we power down the Windows

215
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,350
systems and leave the IBM systems up

216
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,730
well chances are we got a sequel

217
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,460
database on the windows side and we got

218
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,170
a db2 database on the IBM side have you

219
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,420
tested your rollback capabilities there

220
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:24,630
is there transactional integrity are we

221
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,040
gonna corrupt everything here if we want

222
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:30,360
to find the malware that might work

223
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:32,189
might take some time um you know so we

224
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,830
have to really understand quickly on

225
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:38,280
what actions we have and what the impact

226
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:40,590
that is and then decide to go most of

227
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,140
times this is what we do we disable the

228
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,940
routing in between the environments or

229
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,410
disabled and domain accounts at this

230
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,890
point we assume they have domain admin

231
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:51,420
already we can't trust any of our users

232
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,730
because you disabled their accounts send

233
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,790
the people home the little tangent on

234
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,380
this is control the rumor mill

235
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,270
can't tell you how many times that I

236
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,550
hear employees over and Counting say oh

237
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:03,079
my goodness there was this man he looked

238
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:07,219
Russian in here last week I bet you that

239
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:09,560
was patter it's no no you've been

240
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:13,730
compromised for 700 days already how you

241
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:16,310
guys long done then go to management go

242
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,990
to your board have them go figure out

243
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,189
business continuity because you're gonna

244
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,620
have to figure out how to run your

245
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:24,680
business without systems because at this

246
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:28,940
point we are down right we've taken down

247
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:32,180
the business this is a big deal so step

248
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:34,120
two we got a set situation plan again

249
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:37,250
quickly we don't have time for screw-ups

250
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:41,030
so got to know what's broken I know how

251
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:44,210
bad it's broken and we need to fix it we

252
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:47,000
need to know what to fix first so be

253
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:49,520
very very careful with your phrasing of

254
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,810
this what's broken is very obvious to us

255
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,060
we need to know what's broken so we know

256
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,439
what to fix but if you ask this to

257
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,680
anybody outside of our field these are

258
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,290
the answers you gave this is what they

259
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,709
look like

260
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:05,510
okay so rephrase it a little what do we

261
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,550
need to do to stay in business this is

262
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,380
your business cycle planning most

263
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,819
businesses it's very simple you're going

264
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,470
to take orders we're gonna make products

265
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:15,550
ship the products you're gonna pay your

266
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,550
bills and you're gonna collect money

267
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,870
great what do we need to do to do these

268
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,280
things again be careful with your

269
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,540
phrasing we were dealing with a because

270
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,579
well we need all of our systems back

271
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,770
inside don't know we only need a few

272
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,720
systems but what are those systems so

273
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,840
red teamers in the room we're basically

274
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,320
on a black box pen test now we need to

275
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:38,810
figure out how to rebuild Humpty Dumpty

276
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,980
go find whatever you can and take

277
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,719
everything with a little bit of grain of

278
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,040
salt you're not sure what systems are

279
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,330
compromised at this point you're not

280
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,370
sure if those systems are actually

281
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,170
legitimate we don't know anything

282
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:51,860
because Jim is over in Costa Rica

283
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:53,949
enjoying retirement anybody here work in

284
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:57,380
the data center with a raise Florida

285
00:11:53,950 --> 00:12:00,050
pop off the floor tiles look underneath

286
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:02,210
I found a dr binder in there once we are

287
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,390
looking for absolutely anything that can

288
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,520
give us clues on how

289
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,199
we build this system okay any

290
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,630
informations good information till we

291
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,760
prove it wrong put all this stuff up on

292
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:13,920
a wall or a whiteboard or anything like

293
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,560
that because this is what we're shooting

294
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,729
for we're trying to figure out all the

295
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,040
networking we're trying to figure out

296
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:23,010
all the hosts we're trying to build this

297
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,780
back together the problem is this is

298
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,689
what its gonna look like to you this is

299
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:30,240
what it looks like to everybody else

300
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:31,590
right so here's another pro tip if you

301
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,570
want anything to get done in business

302
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:36,900
put in Excel and then color code it

303
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:39,600
magically things get done so we're gonna

304
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:41,340
build this kind of matrix what do we

305
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,350
need to do what systems do we need to do

306
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,120
to do it and how do we recover the

307
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,310
system and this have it step by step

308
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,770
make it really easy for people to read

309
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:52,229
because you don't have time to be given

310
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:54,660
status reports every 20 minutes your

311
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:56,910
will may be a team of three if you're

312
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,500
lucky alright so we don't have time to

313
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:01,290
keep telling people yeah we're still

314
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,940
screwed sorry so put theirs up on a TV

315
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,829
or a projector or something where people

316
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,480
can walk by and go oh there's more

317
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:10,830
greens than the Reds good we're in good

318
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:14,190
business alright so let's talk about how

319
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:16,860
we restore us securely so again we don't

320
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:18,750
have time for a reinfection we don't

321
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,790
know how long these attackers have been

322
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,540
in our network maybe they've planted

323
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,939
time bombs

324
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,170
right if they're low and slow chances

325
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,170
are it's a year two years three years

326
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:30,810
they've already infected all your backup

327
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,400
cycles so if you restore a system you're

328
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,010
restoring the infection we don't have

329
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,140
time for that so we're gonna restore to

330
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:40,140
this quarantine now there's one problem

331
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:44,250
with this diagram remember how we said

332
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:46,050
all systems are impacted chances are if

333
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:48,990
you're part of this type of situation

334
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,609
they hit your backup systems first there

335
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:56,030
recall and all the tapes on your on-site

336
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:56,030
tape library and zero in those out so

337
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,529
we're calling back tapes where we need

338
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,139
physical tapes now we're on our offline

339
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:06,049
solutions there's a lot of active active

340
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:08,160
backup recoveries I'd say we're geo

341
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:09,689
geographically dispersed trade I don't

342
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,259
care whatever fancy technology in terms

343
00:14:09,689 --> 00:14:12,868
you're using

344
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:14,759
but essentially if I corrupt your data

345
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:18,540
in point a it's also replicated over to

346
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:20,730
point B and if I have a disk backup that

347
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,219
is also still online that's also gonna

348
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,290
be overwritten to make sure you have an

349
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,489
answer if your backup systems are

350
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,639
breached and they start deleting

351
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:31,559
everything how do you recover this so

352
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,529
now we can talk about the quarantine so

353
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:37,379
the quarantine system this is out AB and

354
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:39,420
this is air gapped and I really mean air

355
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:42,239
gift because again we can't risk an

356
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,488
infection most of the time you're gonna

357
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:46,619
find that the file shares have been

358
00:14:44,489 --> 00:14:48,569
infected for your entire backup cycle

359
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:50,220
you don't have a clean way to restore a

360
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:52,019
file share just from straight back up so

361
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,929
you have to get creative but if we just

362
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:56,369
put that on there your PS exact W make a

363
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:58,049
sound care how they're doing it it's

364
00:14:56,369 --> 00:15:00,329
going to start infecting your new

365
00:14:58,049 --> 00:15:02,309
network so we really have to let these

366
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:04,410
systems bake a little bit we got to look

367
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:06,839
for these iOS iOS C's indicators of

368
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:08,100
attack indicators are compromised we

369
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,730
need to verify these things are clean

370
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:16,230
before we put them back in production so

371
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:18,089
now we are also not restoring to old

372
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:20,850
production we are moving to new

373
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:22,860
production because again if we are hit

374
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,149
by something like this chances are we

375
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,720
don't have that good of a security

376
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:31,769
posture if you're not patching 408 67

377
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,899
1710 now Oh 708 chances are you're still

378
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:36,149
running Cisco Cisco on your switches how

379
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,379
do we trust the switches because if

380
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:39,089
they're in our environment for this long

381
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:42,889
chances are they've already installed

382
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:45,929
backdoors all your switches so high

383
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:48,269
something really cool happens when you

384
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:52,290
suffer a breach like this anybody know

385
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:55,889
what happens to your budget you get an

386
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:57,629
open checkbook right so I give you guys

387
00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:00,589
the open checkbook what do we want to

388
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:00,589
implement into our new network

389
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:12,040
everything wonderful it's gonna be hard

390
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:14,050
to do with we got like 24 48 hours left

391
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,370
in our time frame here because the

392
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,620
business really wants to come back

393
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:20,249
online so what are you gonna what are we

394
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:22,720
prioritizing what do we want to do

395
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:24,399
segmented networks excellent this

396
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:31,930
wouldn't be possible if you had proper

397
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:36,040
segmentation others clean file server

398
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:39,459
yeah so file servers are massive they're

399
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,870
gigantic do you know how long it takes

400
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:44,290
to restore one of those from physical

401
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:46,870
tapes maybe you don't need all your

402
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,660
family pictures stored on corporate or

403
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:51,850
maybe you had 13 different Nickelback

404
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,949
CDs on your file share you probably

405
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:56,529
don't need to do that so if you can

406
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:58,839
prioritize your business critical files

407
00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:00,639
to restore that's great that goes back

408
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:02,139
to the idea of data classification what

409
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,159
do we really need here and what's the

410
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:09,579
nice to have well that's we got open

411
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:12,669
checkbook and you guys don't like

412
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:16,418
spending money better monitoring or

413
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:17,530
monitoring at all right so again it

414
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:19,809
would be great to know how these

415
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:22,898
attackers got into our network we

416
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:25,299
probably don't know but so here's

417
00:17:22,898 --> 00:17:26,408
another thing so you're breached

418
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:29,799
everything's gone

419
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:32,830
you start recovering anybody having kids

420
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:35,230
here you ever take a ball away from a

421
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:39,070
kid what is the only thing that they

422
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:40,720
want back now so if you just if you

423
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:43,030
contain the breach you took away the

424
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,399
hackers ball that's what they want back

425
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:47,590
and they will come back so if we got

426
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:50,559
monitoring and all this other stuff now

427
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,939
we can see we have telemetry all right

428
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,770
so you guys are terrible at spending

429
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:57,100
money this is what I like to spend money

430
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:58,899
on right so we need a new domain because

431
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:02,110
at this point the domain can be assumed

432
00:17:58,899 --> 00:18:04,530
compromised we have no idea who's valid

433
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,530
who's not

434
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,220
so the question is we already have all

435
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:20,418
this stuff and it was probably

436
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,830
misconfigured that's how we had the

437
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:23,960
breach how do we verify the

438
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:26,989
configurations I'm going to punc that

439
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:30,139
until week two or three of the recovery

440
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:32,929
so because right now the business is

441
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:34,729
still down we we need to get the system

442
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:37,759
back up and then we're gonna go into a

443
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,080
full audit but basically bring in again

444
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,369
we got an open checkbook we're gonna

445
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,330
bring in consultants cuz we just don't

446
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,949
have the time when you keep this

447
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,960
business running and we're gonna run

448
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:47,059
these audits there's some great stuff

449
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,159
out there on red team automation and

450
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:52,820
stuff that comes further in the maturity

451
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:54,230
of the organization but we need to get

452
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:57,739
something you know that's what I'm

453
00:18:54,230 --> 00:19:01,039
prioritizing in our is 0-2 like 150

454
00:18:57,739 --> 00:19:03,289
basically new authentication yet domains

455
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,609
gone we need we need new domain network

456
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:08,210
segmentation somebody mentioned that

457
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:09,889
wonderful zoom logging anything we need

458
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:14,450
to Emma tree when these people come back

459
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:17,299
I got Apple where firewall in their in a

460
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:20,690
very ambiguous logo I swear but um this

461
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:21,499
is saved my behind once or twice we

462
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,169
couldn't identify

463
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:27,379
exfiltration they were tunneling on for

464
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:29,059
53 over DNS traffic if you have an app

465
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:32,269
aware firewall that's been I'd notice it

466
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:34,639
you know block it I our toolkit anybody

467
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:39,830
here able to grab a memory capture

468
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:41,689
remotely okay everybody look at Google

469
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,970
rapid response it's a free open-source

470
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,409
tool it's basically a rootkit you can

471
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,999
install on your clients you can grab

472
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:49,789
memory captures you can grab hard drives

473
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:52,519
you're gonna need a way to quickly get

474
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:57,408
the data on this secondary tertiary

475
00:19:52,519 --> 00:20:00,259
attack implement MFA most of the attacks

476
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:02,359
I saw was a no W way password spray once

477
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:03,830
they have credentials they use the VPN

478
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:04,600
connection in because everything is

479
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:09,408
single-factor

480
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:13,129
put in a multi-factor patch patch patch

481
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:16,740
patch patch patch patch patch

482
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:20,550
vulnerability scanner so let's say that

483
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:22,800
we actually had an okay patching system

484
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,159
but we still had Java installed out

485
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,110
there

486
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,000
we still had Adobe you're not gonna

487
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:29,129
really see that in a wsus or anything

488
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,470
like that go get a vulnerability scanner

489
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:34,920
that way you've got a list to work off

490
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:37,350
of somehow figure out how to proc to

491
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,790
your web traffic because they're gonna

492
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:41,070
be fishing yet they have all your

493
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:44,040
information these fish the emails are

494
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,689
gonna look really good now email

495
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,639
protection

496
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:49,590
chances are yeah maybe in OWA spray

497
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,020
maybe a fish figure out something to

498
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:55,860
drop in just again we're looking for

499
00:20:52,020 --> 00:21:00,510
foundational pieces at this point so

500
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:02,610
that was fun so there's again there's a

501
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:05,010
balance of time and implementation

502
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,540
because we're putting this stuff in it's

503
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:09,330
amazing how fast you can put stuff in

504
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:12,120
without change control but then you know

505
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:13,620
we I'm I'll be honest

506
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,449
we broke a lot of stuff but it doesn't

507
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,580
matter because the business is down but

508
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:19,170
so how much longer can you keep the

509
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,659
business down while you are running

510
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:23,010
around crazy can you perform your

511
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,250
critical functions we need to start

512
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:28,140
pumping money back into this company and

513
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,780
then sleep deprivation is a real thing

514
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:34,170
how much more can you do before you

515
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,639
start making critical mistakes project

516
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,500
make sure you define this stuff ahead of

517
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,580
time because it's really hard to think

518
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,090
about that stuff while you're also

519
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:43,740
trying to figure out the network

520
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:45,959
miscellaneous tips three to one rule

521
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:49,230
conferences everybody know it your war

522
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,940
room is going to smell terrible make

523
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:52,790
sure people are getting showers make

524
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:55,440
sure people are cleaning up the food

525
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:57,720
okay I put three hours of sleep in their

526
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,350
heads that's a pipe dream you're not

527
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,970
sleeping a sign war room manager find

528
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:05,250
somebody that can actually manage all

529
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:08,130
the meeting invites the conference rooms

530
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,840
the note-taking the food the caffeine

531
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,720
intake right you're gonna need somebody

532
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,159
to think about this stuff and it can't

533
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,380
be healing you need to

534
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,550
down here recovering the business save

535
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,900
absolutely everything you don't know

536
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,639
what's gonna be discoverable in court

537
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,680
what's gonna save you five years down

538
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,010
the road USB drives are cheap start

539
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:28,920
right into those in this last part this

540
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:31,410
is a lesson learned from a another

541
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:34,290
poorly configured company ensure secure

542
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:36,810
out of banned communications if you are

543
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:38,730
breached and you know your email system

544
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:41,310
is breached don't email the new

545
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:44,280
credentials to your new systems over

546
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:45,990
that same email all right if you have

547
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,960
corporate phones assume those are

548
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:54,060
breached don't be texting passwords get

549
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:57,750
out of band and so that was awful

550
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:59,040
I never want to do that again so we kind

551
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,080
of want to talk about how do we move

552
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,909
forward from this because this is the

553
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:06,870
most expensive learning lesson you are

554
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:08,280
ever gonna have so don't waste it so u

555
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:10,530
s-- again you you start asking yourself

556
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,580
questions where we week how we

557
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:16,170
prioritize any sis appease in here

558
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,620
gap analysis this is what we're gonna do

559
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,870
it right now

560
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,669
so we're gonna define three things where

561
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,270
are we where do we want to be and how do

562
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,630
we get there

563
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:26,010
well we know where we are we're terrible

564
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:28,590
we just lived through it the only stuff

565
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:29,360
we have is the stuff we rebuild where do

566
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,770
we want to be

567
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,719
I'll go steal go steal somebody's

568
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:35,310
framework these people are a lot better

569
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,290
at defining this stuff they do it for

570
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,429
the jobs go steal somebody's framework

571
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,690
don't try to make it up here on it's

572
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:43,290
like rolling your own encryption don't

573
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:46,170
do it now has anybody here read one of

574
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:48,690
these frameworks how many of you fell

575
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:52,320
asleep during it he said these documents

576
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:54,000
are awful to read and another challenge

577
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,510
you're gonna have is educating your

578
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,430
board your C levels your executives know

579
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:01,200
what just happened and why do we care

580
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,610
about it so you're gonna have to do is

581
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,530
kind of create your own framework and

582
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:06,179
get it to a point that you can educate

583
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:07,879
these people they're not technical

584
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:11,070
people some of here's another project

585
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:13,050
your board is very good at very little

586
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:15,000
they know how to make money and they

587
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:17,700
know how to manage risk that's about it

588
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,210
but they're really good at it give it to

589
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:23,190
them in a way that they can consume it

590
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,900
here's one of the eye charts there's a

591
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:26,530
link at the bottom go steal this I

592
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,940
created this framework for one

593
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:31,480
the companies but basically it's an

594
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:33,700
estate hundred fifty three and what I

595
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,490
did is I made it understandable to the

596
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,860
public so instead of talking about

597
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:42,010
standards and network encryption and all

598
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:44,679
this other stuff like so if we had a

599
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:47,440
standard for every networks which is

600
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,720
talking us and then P to a logical

601
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,610
server we just have network operations

602
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,170
our baseline that's something that they

603
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:55,929
can consume and that's something that

604
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:57,970
they can run with action so again we'll

605
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:00,040
zoom up so here's one physical devices

606
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:01,540
are inventoried right this is like 13

607
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,030
pages in this it's awful

608
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:05,590
but this is understandable it's gonna

609
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,660
relate to your asset management program

610
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:09,669
IT is most likely the people gonna be

611
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,070
driving it and I got this scale one

612
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:13,990
through five if you're here for Isaiah's

613
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:16,540
talk I talked about how I love the

614
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:18,130
maturity models so what we're gonna do

615
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:20,010
is we're gonna define where we're at in

616
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:22,960
the scale from a scale of one to five

617
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:25,090
and now notice this one we want to be at

618
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,190
a three if you make everything a five

619
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:29,080
you are wasting money because every

620
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:31,090
dollar we spend here we can't pump back

621
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,500
into the business to make money so we

622
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:35,639
need to be very strategic and where we

623
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,870
want to be so they defined this

624
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:41,140
capability maturity model against this

625
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:43,629
B's this is boring stuff but it's really

626
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,520
good in getting budget and you know

627
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:48,100
explaining to others that aren't in the

628
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,870
trenches like us so we're gonna go from

629
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,639
one through five one is an ad hoc

630
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:55,300
process this is something that you have

631
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,900
to think about every time number two is

632
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,450
repeatable

633
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:01,960
Ryan can do it every time and it's the

634
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:03,850
same way but if I talk to Joe Joe

635
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,550
doesn't know how to do it right so he's

636
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:09,310
back down to a 1 I'm at a - ok fine

637
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:11,680
we'll call it it - we go to 3 there's a

638
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:14,200
defined process I can hand this off to

639
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,180
somebody else with similar skills and

640
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,170
I'll get the same outcome alright this

641
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,460
is where your processes and your

642
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:22,000
procedures and your standards and all

643
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:24,940
that stuff comes from or is managed this

644
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,670
is doing notice exceptions immediately

645
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:30,010
so we have a baseline and we see an

646
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:33,010
alteration on that we know about it and

647
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:35,060
we can react to it now and then 5 it's

648
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:36,740
optimized continued improvement

649
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,350
this is the highest level of

650
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:41,930
optimization right so this is you have

651
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:43,459
some type of machine running your

652
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:45,890
process for you there's little to no

653
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:48,980
human involvement it's really expensive

654
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:50,690
all right so we're gonna go through this

655
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,970
framework and identify where we're at

656
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:56,000
today and then where we want to be or

657
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:57,770
where is good enough right in security

658
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,870
perfect is the enemy of good we don't

659
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:01,460
need to be perfect everywhere but we

660
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,439
need to explain where we want to be at

661
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:07,280
least as a baseline and then we can

662
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,990
start improving from there so we start

663
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,600
talking about activities so if we're at

664
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,070
one in a physical asset management now

665
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,469
and we want to be a three what do we

666
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:18,379
need to do so we start defining projects

667
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:19,730
we defined programs around this so this

668
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,900
one is an asset management program right

669
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,970
we're gonna have a system that's

670
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:25,250
tracking acquisition to deposition for

671
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:27,020
all of our assets all right we're gonna

672
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:29,120
have stickers on front of our laptops

673
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,340
with barcodes I can scan them it goes

674
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,530
into some system and we're tracking the

675
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,659
assets now cool we just went from a1 to

676
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:37,639
a3 and we're gonna work through our

677
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:39,560
entire sheet until we have all these

678
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,350
different programs you're gonna notice

679
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,490
that like we can get ten or fifteen

680
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,770
controller cards with an asset

681
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:47,960
management program so you're gonna have

682
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,580
these different programs that you need

683
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,160
to do right you got asset management for

684
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:53,570
mobility management I am you go down the

685
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,440
list there's a lot of stuff we need to

686
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:59,389
do as we weren't doing security first so

687
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:02,570
yeah that's a lot of work so what do we

688
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:03,440
do first well we can throw out a lot so

689
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:06,139
there's a lot of different ways of

690
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,390
threat model we can do this data flow we

691
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:10,070
can do entity relationships we can talk

692
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,990
about the geopolitical relationships in

693
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:15,980
the Middle East

694
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:18,080
no again we're at Ground Zero

695
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,400
let's dump this down all right there's

696
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:24,530
bad guys there's good guys and there's

697
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:26,180
things we're protecting so loss

698
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:28,520
expectancy everybody know what lost

699
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:30,200
expectancy is we're at a casino you

700
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:35,030
should really know about lost expectancy

701
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:36,590
so this is how likely are you to lose

702
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:39,050
how much basically you multiply them

703
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:40,699
together you get lost expectancy so

704
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,440
here's a pictorial representation of

705
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,720
that so things on the all the way right

706
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,180
are guaranteed to happen things on the

707
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,660
left

708
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:51,390
probably not gonna happen got impact on

709
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:53,490
the y-axis so up at the top big impact

710
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,720
down at the bottom little impact and

711
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:56,970
what happens is you get this nice little

712
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,500
overlay top rights are need to mitigate

713
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:01,040
these things are most likely gonna

714
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,510
happen it's gonna cause you a big impact

715
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:07,139
bottom-left don't worry about those low

716
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:08,640
impact low likelihood where you get

717
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,490
those other two quadrants or tough

718
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,560
decisions it's like do we have to plan

719
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:15,300
for earthquakes if we have an earthquake

720
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,760
in our data center we're probably down

721
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:21,060
right so but it might be low impact

722
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,950
unless we're on the west coast so gotta

723
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:25,710
understand this stuff but uh I have

724
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:28,170
another option I call this bang for buck

725
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:30,810
so we take our loss expectancy and we

726
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:33,030
put it on ease of implementation so on

727
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:36,870
the left is very hard stuff to do on the

728
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:40,020
right is very easy stuff to do so now we

729
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:41,669
have a very good one this is no brainers

730
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:44,010
this is very easy stuff that's going to

731
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:45,780
mitigate 80% of your problems right this

732
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:49,590
is the 80/20 rule that you hear always

733
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:55,190
talked about anybody running laps local

734
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:57,419
admin password solution how easy is it

735
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:59,280
so for those of you that don't know

736
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:02,070
local admin password solution is from

737
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:04,230
Microsoft it on your endpoints you have

738
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,970
a local admin password that is probably

739
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:08,370
shared across every single device that

740
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,680
you have in your environment so if I'm

741
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:12,149
able to grab that I have access to every

742
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,760
single endpoint on your environment it's

743
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:18,390
bad bad news so Microsoft said all right

744
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:20,220
here's a free tool lapse what it does is

745
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:21,690
you push it out there's a PowerShell

746
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,550
script that you run to update your

747
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,170
schema and then there's a GPO to push it

748
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:27,510
out to your clients that's it it's three

749
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:29,490
steps it's awesome but what it does is

750
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:31,260
it hooks into your endpoints and it

751
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:33,180
rotates the local admin password on

752
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:36,150
there at some cadence that you set one

753
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:38,970
hour 24 hours 30 days it's definable and

754
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:41,220
then to anybody that needs access to the

755
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:43,830
admin password there's a little GUI that

756
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,840
they log into and you get the computer

757
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:48,060
name and the current admin password for

758
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,220
it once you use it you have the option

759
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:52,530
to cycle it so nobody actually knows

760
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,570
your passwords on your endpoints what do

761
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:58,460
you say

762
00:30:53,570 --> 00:31:01,340
a couple minutes hours they about an

763
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:07,429
hour and a half that is way up there on

764
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:09,230
the no-brainer scale go do laps top left

765
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:11,120
these are big projects these are things

766
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:13,040
that are very hard to do that will

767
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,820
mitigate your biggest problems you hear

768
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:18,139
about zero trust you hear about

769
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,549
privileged access management if you're

770
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:22,070
able to pull these things off they

771
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:23,750
eliminate most ear threats but they're

772
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,460
very hard to do we're not gonna

773
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:28,190
prioritize those over the no-brainers

774
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,780
right now bottom right are things that

775
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:31,040
really don't have an impact but we know

776
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,660
there's problems with them and we'll

777
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,960
just get back to them right audit

778
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:38,240
remediations on like 2% of your estate

779
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,130
right these are things together they're

780
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,419
easy to do we don't have time to do it

781
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,950
right now though so when we have time

782
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:44,870
we'll do it if you're hiring interns

783
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:46,850
this is intern work right you've done

784
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:48,489
the softball projects that actually have

785
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:50,270
an impact but are really easy to do

786
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:52,669
bottom-left don't do them they're really

787
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:53,929
hard to do I don't have any examples of

788
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:55,040
these but anything that's really hard to

789
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:58,850
do that doesn't really solve a problem

790
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,740
don't even talk about cool so we know

791
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:05,120
what we need to do we know we need to do

792
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:06,620
first let's go do it we know that we're

793
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,270
gonna need people to do this go find

794
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:12,139
some people we're going to need money go

795
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:15,379
find somebody so again we talked about

796
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:19,400
the open checkbook anybody know how long

797
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:21,620
the open checkbook lasts for I've seen

798
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,809
about three to six months and then all

799
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:25,790
of a sudden everybody forgot about what

800
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:28,070
just happened they want to spend money

801
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:30,799
on new R&D and your security program is

802
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:32,600
getting cut again we need to govern this

803
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,460
and we need to show progress because

804
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,260
otherwise you're gonna lose all your

805
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:39,049
momentum and especially if you did a

806
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:40,790
really good job at recovery I've heard

807
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:42,139
this side was well it only costs us a

808
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,460
couple million dollars and this is the

809
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,760
first time that's ever happened in 20

810
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,250
years

811
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,590
if this happens once every 20 years I'm

812
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:50,559
good with it

813
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:53,480
and we did do a good job of recovering

814
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:55,340
all right so we need some governance and

815
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,720
we need this some metrics and show that

816
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,399
we're actually putting value back into

817
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,049
the company we can't be a cost center if

818
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,429
we become a cost center or is the only

819
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:03,429
thing that anybody cares about

820
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:10,250

has changed as well environments change

823
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,410
reprioritize your projects based on

824
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:17,809
changes and then continue your gap

825
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:21,799
analysis and you know what happened

826
00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:26,330
you're accidentally I see so no whether

827
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:28,730
you like it or not so thanks everyone I

828
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:30,199

833
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:39,080
the conversations that's on off of this

834
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,179
my goal of this talk is not to educate

835
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,470
you as something on anything new I got

836
00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:43,880
other talks on that where we're dropping

837
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:46,160
new tools or O'Day's or anything like

838
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,919
that this talk is really meant for you

839
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,490
to think about what you would do in this

840
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:51,290
situation

841
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:52,730
think about your environment if you

842
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:54,409
didn't have your backup systems what

843
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,240
happens if you had a complete

844
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:58,400
compromised what happens if your

845
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,750
firewalls were compromised and you can't

846
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,270
trust your firewall rules what are you

847
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:04,370

848
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:05,510
