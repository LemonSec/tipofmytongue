1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:13,230
hey everybody we're about to get started

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,820
here we're about to have Justin Baumann

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,650
who is currently a leader in information

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,330
security for IBM cloud with a background

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,520
in red and blue teaming over the past

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,930
ten years so have multiple degrees and

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,400
certifications in the field and he's

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,779
affected positive change and securing

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,098
some of the largest environments and

10
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,660
cloud deployments in the world today

11
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,660
please everybody give him a hand

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,710
everybody can still hear me right ok

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,670
good good so I know it's a little late

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:50,180
for this but good morning

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:54,410
that was weak it was terrible

16
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:57,180
one more time good morning thank you

17
00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:00,989
thank you all right

18
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,670
so I promise I did not put any memes in

19
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:03,660
my slideshow because I figure you guys

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,159
have probably seen enough of those

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,950
you're gonna see more later on today so

22
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,840
it may look a little dull but I promise

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,140
I will try to make it as interesting as

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,659
possible I'm not gonna spend a lot of

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:20,070
time on myself try not to be a selfish

26
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:23,150
person but here's my credentials well

27
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,990
what you need to know anyway right so as

28
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:28,140
previously mentioned I work for IBM

29
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,149
cloud my thoughts and in comments here

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,250
today though disclaimer are my own I'm

31
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,950
not a rep of IBM and if I ever claim to

32
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:39,119
be I will probably lose my job so we'll

33
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:43,740
just leave it at that so jumping right

34
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,270
in my total plan for this presentation

35
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,649
is actually have you guys do the

36
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,350
presentation I'm just gonna ask you guys

37
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:51,780
questions and you look for feedback

38
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:55,199
anybody in here let me gauge really

39
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,509
quick here anybody here technically

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,960
experienced in penetration testing or

41
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:05,520
ethical hacking show hands ok we have a

42
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,500
few ok let's go to the opposite side

43
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,419
anybody in here technically experienced

44
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:14,340
on the blue team side security

45
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:17,010
monitoring sock instant response dir

46
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,629
okay we have we have some okay so let's

47
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,560
get away from technical real quick let's

48
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:22,859
go non-technical

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,750
anybody experienced in bringing outside

50
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,940
vendors into your organization to

51
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,849
provide some kind of service like pen

52
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,379
testing or vulnerability scanning okay

53
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,390
so we've got a few we got a few so you

54
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,890
guys know the pain right you guys have

55
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,349
been you guys are familiar with

56
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,208
procurement right

57
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:41,488
terrible terrible doesn't matter who you

58
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:44,430
work for terrible so let's go to the

59
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:47,370
other side non-technical side do we have

60
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,599
any auditors in the in the crowd and

61
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,709
I'll understand if you don't want to

62
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:54,899
raise your hand yes I thought I think we

63
00:02:52,709 --> 00:03:00,150
have one hand come up your brave soul

64
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:04,349
brave soul okay so um does everybody

65
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:06,900
know what pin testing is maybe a better

66
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:08,510
way to phrase that is does everybody

67
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,890
understand the difference between

68
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:16,530
vulnerability management slash skinning

69
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:19,500
and an actual pen test okay I see a few

70
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,970
heads there's a few okay so let's run

71
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,220
through it real quick so what is pin

72
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,959
testing so pin testing the long and

73
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,790
short it is not if you skip to the

74
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,230
middle bullet point there it is not

75
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,200
vulnerable team management

76
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:34,798
I don't think across the industry we

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,078
have a huge misconception today with

78
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,090
mixing up vulnerability management and

79
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,560
pen testing but if you would have asked

80
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,450
people that same question probably two

81
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,349
or three years ago there would have been

82
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:48,358
a lot of mix and part of that which I'm

83
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:51,869
going to talk about today had to do a

84
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:54,000
lot with outside vendors right because

85
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,220
vendors are in the they're in the market

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,019
to make money right and seller services

87
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,910
just like all of the companies that we

88
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,540
work for they're doing the same thing

89
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,099
right and so if they could squeeze in

90
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,358
they're going to squeezing a service if

91
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:08,280
they're going to provide value to your

92
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:11,040
organization they want to do that right

93
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,510
it's twofold so but to be clear pin

94
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,220
testing is not bold a building

95
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,639
management a vulnerability management

96
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,260
the big difference is lots of automated

97
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,139
scanning for vulnerability management

98
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,570
and on the pen test side virtually no

99
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,700
automated scanning

100
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:30,800
like 85 90 percent manual testing of

101
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:33,590
whatever technical systems or

102
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,450
applications you provide that that team

103
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:38,270
thing or in scope does that make sense

104
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,490
everybody awesome

105
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,710
awesome so down at the bottom there's a

106
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,450
couple of things there this is just a

107
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:48,590
brief list of everything that pen

108
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:52,729
testing can or may cover this is totally

109
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:54,500
dependent on the scope that that you

110
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:56,180
guys assuming you're bringing an outside

111
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,590
vendor in you're an outside team and

112
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,040
it's totally dependent on what you guys

113
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,619
want

114
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,970
right what it what's required another

115
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,740
question I'm gonna ask a lot of

116
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:08,200
questions

117
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:14,840
who here has to deal with PCI yeah yeah

118
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:16,610
terrible terrible PCI is a pain it has

119
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,489
good intentions and it is very

120
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:22,760
technically valid which is great far

121
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:24,980
more mature than HIPAA but if you've

122
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,680
been through PCI audits or been involved

123
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,660
in PCI in any way shape or form being

124
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,460
you probably have familiarity with some

125
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,250
of the pen test and and vulnerability

126
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,680
scanning requirements that are there the

127
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,770
network segmentation testing things of

128
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:43,580
that nature so let's skip to the next

129
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:46,370
slide okay so we're going to talk about

130
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:49,159
pen testing in three different forms the

131
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,140
first stage is your pre engagement stage

132
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,370
so this is your planning stage it's just

133
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:56,840
like any other project right in most

134
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,100
organizations you're going to have one

135
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,989
of two types of people or a team of

136
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,310
people that are doing the pre engagement

137
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,130
right you're either going to have just

138
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:06,650
PM's or some kind of business control

139
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,300
person looking at the vendors helping

140
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,159
determine the scope business analyst

141
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,570
login to your tech folks helping

142
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,490
determine the scope right or you're

143
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:18,590
going to have a mix or and in my case

144
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,720
we're all all of us are hardcore

145
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,570
technical security people but we also

146
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,380
act as project managers which is not

147
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:30,560
always the best thing but it works right

148
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,010
we make it work so as I mentioned

149
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,540
already

150
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:36,110
always remember vendors are out to make

151
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,490
money part of this talk is to cover how

152
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,819
to how to six

153
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:43,430
excessively bring in vendors to meet

154
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:45,110
your requirements that's that's what you

155
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,669
want that's why you hire a vendor in the

156
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,160
first place right is to meet your

157
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:51,289
requirements you're the client you're

158
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,009
not there to meet their requirements

159
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:56,900
right it's the other way around okay the

160
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:59,120
first rule in pin testing when you're

161
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,818
bringing in a vendor is schedule as far

162
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,919
in advance as possible now a little bit

163
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:08,210
more background on it's exactly what I

164
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:10,250
do so my entire team of hackers the only

165
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,830
thing that we do we do we do red teaming

166
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,440
internally for IBM cloud but the

167
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,599
majority of our work is strictly hiring

168
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,610
outside vendors to come in and do the

169
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,930
hacking for us and it's just simply

170
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:26,750
because we have so much PCI scope and we

171
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:29,960
also have internal IBM security policies

172
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,789
that require pin testing of everything

173
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,460
under the Sun around the world so we

174
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:37,370
have a team of dedicated red teamers to

175
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,810
do red teaming but also the vendor

176
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,430
hiring and we did that for a reason

177
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,719
right we did have a reason because we

178
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,000
could talk the lingo with the vendors

179
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:46,159
right it's easier when you've done to

180
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,539
work yourself to communicate with the

181
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:49,759
vendor that's going to provide that

182
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:53,030
service it's easier to break the scope

183
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,909
down right and make sure that you're

184
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:58,309
covering with that vendor everything

185
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:59,870
that you need to be has anybody done a

186
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,880
pinch I've brought up a vendor and done

187
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,130
a pen test and they realize like a month

188
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,650
or three or four months later that you

189
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:10,250
missed a resource that should have been

190
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,419
in scope and redo a test I know we

191
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,169
didn't have a lot of people bringing in

192
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:17,810
vendors okay so that happens for more

193
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:20,630
than probably what you think a lot of

194
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,759
folks think I talk to a lot of more on

195
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,680
technical technical PM's they're charged

196
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:26,659
with bringing these vendors in and they

197
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,190
don't have good solid technical security

198
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:30,050
folks to talk to them and provide them

199
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,088
guidance on what exactly needs to be in

200
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,130
scope from like a PCI pentest

201
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:35,990
perspective or let's say an FFIEC

202
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,120
pentest perspective they're gonna be

203
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,740
lost right chances are if something's

204
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,560
gonna be left out and it may or may not

205
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:46,820
get caught until the next year's pentest

206
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:50,270
right going back to part of what my team

207
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,410
does is because we do the red teaming

208
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:54,680
internally but also we bring

209
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:58,310
vendors we do almost 500 penetration

210
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:01,670
tests a year and that's a lot 400 of

211
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:04,369
those are third-party vendors doing it

212
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,870
for us so we have a ton of experience in

213
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,920
the space which is why I'm gonna bring

214
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,920
this talk to you guys today

215
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:15,529
okay the second rule of thumb is

216
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:17,389
negotiations are key on how many people

217
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:20,449
in here have experience just with any

218
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:23,569
vendors period security non-security

219
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:25,250
anything okay so we have quite a few

220
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:28,219
then if we if we broaden that scope we

221
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,230
apply for you right so you guys are

222
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,470
probably familiar with bidding things

223
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,639
out and things of that nature right

224
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:37,639
always some of that kind of comes as

225
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:39,170
common sense unfortunately you know

226
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:40,850
several years ago one of the issues that

227
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:44,660
we had in our organization is that

228
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,670
wasn't happening and the simple fun fact

229
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,399
was we had a lot of non-technical PM's

230
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:51,319
doing this work and they were not being

231
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,899
given any technical resources to bounce

232
00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:55,550
ideas off or help validate scope and so

233
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:56,750
we were missing a ton of things that

234
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,819
should have been in scope on our tests

235
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,519
that weren't and then we were coming up

236
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:05,329
short and our compliance regulations

237
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,910
like PCI and FF IC whatnot right so

238
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:14,599
hence our team got put in place no more

239
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:16,550
issues right so going on to the testing

240
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,959
methodology so a couple items that you

241
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,199
want to look at when you're engaging

242
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:23,268
Pincess vendors you want to ask for

243
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:26,359
their testing methodology this is

244
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:28,610
important because it gives you an idea

245
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,279
of how much manual pen testing they're

246
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,769
gonna do versus automated automated

247
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,480
scanning they're gonna do wise I'm gonna

248
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:40,639
porting goes back to our previous slide

249
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:43,040
right n zesting is not what right

250
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,240
exactly exactly and you don't want you

251
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,069
don't want to pay for a vulnerability

252
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,480
scan when you can do that you're still

253
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:49,759
if you probably already are doing that

254
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,470
yourself right that's just gonna show

255
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,930
you oh well you know I'm running an

256
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,029
outdated version of TLS you know TLS 100

257
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:58,519
or 100 and whatever it may be and I

258
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:01,009
should be running 1.2 right now that's

259
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:03,709
not part of pin test criteria that's

260
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:04,630
part of on durability scanning right and

261
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:06,969
so you don't want to pay

262
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:09,610
for an expensive pen test 30 40 50 60

263
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:11,380
thousand dollars just to find out the

264
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:15,190
same things are already seeing your own

265
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:17,260
vulnerability scans write the statement

266
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,960
of work is key so you want to make sure

267
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:23,920
your statement and work is it's very

268
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:27,190
sound the testing methodology may or may

269
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,719
not be part of your smw but at the as

270
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,150
part of the pre engagement when you

271
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,500
engage a vendor you're going to have an

272
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,810
initial conversation with them to

273
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,930
discuss the scope they're gonna draft an

274
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:39,430
initial s o W for you to review there's

275
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:42,550
a couple of things you want to look for

276
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:44,260
in there one the scope what's the point

277
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,810
of an S o W if it doesn't include the

278
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:49,240
scope right you want to make sure that

279
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,849
all of the technical details of the

280
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,410
scope you discuss are in the s o W I

281
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,540
can't tell you how many times I've I've

282
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,920
gone to a vendor and said hey here's

283
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,329
what we're going to do we gave them all

284
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,060
the tech details and then we got the

285
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:03,190
draft s o W and guess what it's missing

286
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,750
the tech details so we had to go back to

287
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,520
them and say hey look guys how do we

288
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,720
know what you guys how do you know what

289
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,640
you're supposed to be doing what are we

290
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,050
agreeing to if you guys didn't include

291
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:17,050
what we told you we wanted to hire you

292
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:19,000
for right the testing time frame number

293
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,160
of days number of man-hours is

294
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,550
critically important to be included in

295
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:28,209
your s o W here most vendors will break

296
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:30,189
down a pen test engagement by either or

297
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:32,710
those or they will provide both number

298
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:36,070
of testing days or number of testing

299
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:39,550
hours I usually see a lot of man hours

300
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:42,370
versus days so you know for example if

301
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:44,229
we if you pitch them a scope they may

302
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,480
come back and they say okay well here's

303
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,850
the total cost you know fifteen thousand

304
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,880
five hundred dollars and that's for

305
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,170
sixty four or man-hours of testing and

306
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,030
then of course that leads you in in the

307
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,189
conversation of well when can we test

308
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:59,530
what time of day can we test you are

309
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,300
their customer change windows we need to

310
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,730
consider so we're restricted you know

311
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,189
that's a lot of times why they don't go

312
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,170
by days because there may be specific

313
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,180
restrictions in place to like change

314
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:13,540
windows they may not be able to sit down

315
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:15,550
and do your entire pen test you know

316
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,709
Monday Tuesday Wednesday as they like to

317
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,339
do it you know because you might have

318
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,019
specific

319
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:23,529
trolls for your environments they just

320
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:26,430
can't do it right look for that in your

321
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:30,759
s Oh W obviously in the final price is

322
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:32,529
important if you can get them to provide

323
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:35,620
you a breakdown a pricing breakdown

324
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:39,699
which goes to point number three that is

325
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:41,439
great because it shows you how many how

326
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:43,290
much time during that engagement they're

327
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:46,300
going to spend actually doing testing

328
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:48,579
versus actually working on reporting a

329
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:52,449
lot of vendors will say okay we're going

330
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:54,160
to give you sixty four hours of of

331
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:57,160
testing and we're going to assign two

332
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,749
resources to it but one of the things

333
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,670
that could be left out or missed is

334
00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:02,769
you're thinking well I'm getting sixty

335
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,839
four hours of testing right in reality

336
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:07,180
you're not you're maybe only getting 48

337
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:09,040
hours of testing because the other hours

338
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,469
might be allotted to just developing the

339
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,998
report okay so that's important to look

340
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,160
at you know you want to make sure you're

341
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:16,930
getting the best bang for your buck you

342
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,240
don't want to pay for 64 hours of

343
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,339
testing and find out you only got 25

344
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,170
hours of actually testing and then all

345
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:25,929
the rest of it was you know documenting

346
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:30,490
a word document and generating a PDF

347
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:32,889
report for you right and of course the

348
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:36,189
last of the last few bullet points kind

349
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:38,079
of go hand in hand so the tools of

350
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:42,069
methodology this is another good one to

351
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:44,469
look for may not be included in the sfw

352
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:47,649
but it should be included in the final

353
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:49,749
report you get which will touch on tools

354
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:52,629
will give you a really good indicator as

355
00:14:49,749 --> 00:14:54,819
to how much automated versus manual

356
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:56,410
testing they're gonna do so if you see a

357
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:57,670
lot of tools so say if they give you

358
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,040
four or five different tools are gonna

359
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:02,259
use if you see things like like

360
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,269
automated scanners like necess that's

361
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:06,189
fine but if all the other tools are

362
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:08,379
automate are automated scanners that

363
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:10,029
would that's a big red flag right there

364
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:12,100
that's a really good indicator you're

365
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:14,709
gonna get a vulnerability scan and not

366
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,600
an actual pen test so if you start

367
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:18,939
seeing tools like burp suite how many

368
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,519
people have heard of burp suite anybody

369
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:25,259
used it right say okay so we got for you

370
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,589
okay if you see tools a lot of times

371
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:29,679
excuse me

372
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:31,269
Kali is the big Linux distro right a lot

373
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,410
of times instead of listing all the

374
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:34,839
individual

375
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,640
they'll just put Kali Linux bet you're

376
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:39,880
good indicator that they're probably

377
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,920
going to do a lot of manual testing and

378
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,649
they've of course the scope so one of

379
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,170
the things that you might scope if you

380
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:49,630
do your own in-house app development and

381
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,520
let's say for example it has to be PCI

382
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,920
compliant or let's say for a better

383
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:57,279
example your your organization is really

384
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:01,209
prime with doing proactive security haha

385
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:03,580
and they want to pay a $60,000 test to

386
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:07,869
test your in-house app that's non

387
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:09,790
regulated right that's great to hear one

388
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:12,339
of the things in your in your in your

389
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:15,849
scope might be code scanning or code

390
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:17,860
review anybody anybody seen that manual

391
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,930
code review in any pens s they've been

392
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:22,180
engaged in it okay so it's usually a

393
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:24,399
pretty hefty or price but it's a really

394
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,140
good way to bring in an outside vendor

395
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,690
in that may have some background in

396
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,459
development or web application pen

397
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,830
testing and give them access to your

398
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:35,500
source code that's what code code review

399
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:37,450
is and they will actually go through

400
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,740
your your code line by line and make

401
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,510
sure it actually does what it's supposed

402
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:43,209
to do is it acting the way it's supposed

403
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:45,220
to are there are there better ways to

404
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:47,500
write code to do the same thing that's

405
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,029
more secure we like to say usually

406
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,510
there's a heavier price it comes with

407
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:54,430
that but that's something that you know

408
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,930
if you start seeing tools like

409
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,029
checkmarks anybody familiar with

410
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,199
checkmarks

411
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:02,290
they're they're kind of an automated

412
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,110
code reveal tool they have a automated

413
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:09,790
but manual mechanism and they're in

414
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:12,250
their tool I believe so anyway if you

415
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:14,379
guys don't for those that do in in-house

416
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,630
app development I do highly recommend

417
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,970
bringing an outside vendor in to do

418
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,709
those manual source code reviews a lot

419
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,179
of people don't do that because they're

420
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:27,069
thinking well I've given my crown jewels

421
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:28,990
to a third a third party vendor you know

422
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:32,409
but if you properly vet them they have

423
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:33,790
strong credentials then it shouldn't

424
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,260
really be an issue as long as you don't

425
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,970
say okay yeah we're going to give you

426
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,710
guys our source code and then you post

427
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:41,730
all that code on public github repo

428
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,730
don't do that

429
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:47,220
okay so we touched on a few of these

430
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,320
already bid your workout

431
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,150
this was the our organization this was

432
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,280
the number one problem that we were

433
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:56,490
seeing B aside from the scope issue that

434
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,470
I mentioned earlier is because we had a

435
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,560
lot of folks that weren't experienced in

436
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:04,290
insecurity or they weren't experienced

437
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,760
in in vendor management in general what

438
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:08,520
we were seeing was we were spending a

439
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,340
ton of money per vendor on on just one

440
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,440
vendor and nothing was being bid out and

441
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,990
so you know once our team was put in

442
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,630
place we immediately fixed that and we

443
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:20,460
did it for two reasons first reason was

444
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,020
because we were spending almost triple

445
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,720
the amount of money a year than what we

446
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,330
actually needed to be spending and the

447
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,460
second thing is is because the quality

448
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:32,760
of our testing which you can usually

449
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:35,580
tell from the reports you get was very

450
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,740
very low so we were getting crushed in

451
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:41,520
both areas that we shouldn't have been

452
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:43,950
right so bid everything out even if

453
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,710
you're an organization that only has to

454
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:50,340
do the the one time of year pen test for

455
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:53,280
some regulation still bid it out to at

456
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,689
least at least three vendors three

457
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,430
different vendors and if you have no

458
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,660
idea where to start I promise you

459
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,810
there's a ton of communities out on

460
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:04,070
Google I'm sorry Tony communities out on

461
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:08,190
DuckDuckGo just you know DuckDuckGo it

462
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:10,620
and I promise you you'll find a slew of

463
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,480
vendors that you can pick from and if

464
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,209
you find that you have enough time to

465
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,430
take bid more than three you know do

466
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,140
five six or seven however many it takes

467
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,940
to make your organization feel

468
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,560
comfortable with the amount of money

469
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:26,670
you're going to spend versus what you're

470
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:28,710
going to get back from them right the

471
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,360
other thing you want to ask is are they

472
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:33,030
actually authorized have they ever done

473
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,550
PCI testing have they ever done the

474
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:38,220
FedRAMP testing by the way anybody

475
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:42,360
involved in FedRAMP in testing FedRAMP

476
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:46,980
and all okay so is anybody familiar with

477
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:49,679
3pa OS / FedRAMP okay so if you have to

478
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:52,190
bring in a vendor hey I can only speak

479
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,679
from pen testing for two

480
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:57,139
the FedRAMP certified environment that

481
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:59,929
vendor has to pay a really really hefty

482
00:19:57,139 --> 00:20:03,080
cost every year to be what they call a

483
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:05,149
three p AO which is specific to Fred

484
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,250
Graham if they don't have that

485
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:10,129
credential then that vendor can never

486
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:12,289
ever ever test a FedRAMP certified

487
00:20:10,129 --> 00:20:14,480
environment and if they do your tests

488
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:16,879
and and the money you spend is totally

489
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,019
invalid because it won't be accepted by

490
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:22,009
by the auditors that makes sense I

491
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:25,159
learned that lesson the hard way this

492
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:26,450
year we only have one FedRAMP

493
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:30,289
environment and we don't you know we

494
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:32,809
test it annually and yeah it was a good

495
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:35,090
lesson learned so another thing you want

496
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:37,340
to ask are the insured what what do you

497
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:40,639
what what do you do who's gonna eat the

498
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:42,799
cost if they come in and you have a

499
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:46,100
multi-million dollar public facing site

500
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,090
and they instantly ddos it who's going

501
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,309
to cover that cost

502
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:51,620
what if it's down for four days and cost

503
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:54,200
your company you know a million dollars

504
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,090
because of downtime who's going to cover

505
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,019
that cost well I can tell you who should

506
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:59,418
cover it

507
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:01,460
right but some of it boils down to how

508
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:03,769
much insurance they have to cover losses

509
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,779
they got may or may not be expected

510
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:07,850
right now I can tell you in my

511
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:10,039
experience I've never seen this happen

512
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,299
an actual incidental DDoS happen to

513
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:13,009
where you know what costing them money

514
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:15,379
but then again I'm only testing one

515
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:17,629
organization and there's a ton out there

516
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:20,090
so has anybody heard any stories of any

517
00:21:17,629 --> 00:21:22,820
Pinto spenders accidentally tipping

518
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:24,620
something over they should know okay

519
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:30,559
okay we should chat after this because I

520
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:32,239
like stories so and then of course the

521
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,320
scope creep so scope creep does

522
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,259
everybody know what scope creep is

523
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,178
anybody heard the term

524
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:40,100
okay okay so in general it's you know

525
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:42,169
you set a scope and they went somewhere

526
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:46,730
down the road in the project it changes

527
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:48,259
usually by expanding right I can tell

528
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:51,470
you the pentose measures do not like

529
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:53,539
that at all simply because they charge

530
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:55,519
by the hour and they're very very tight

531
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:56,990
with their scope and planning as part of

532
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:58,850
their pre engagement process right

533
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:00,710
especially if they're if they're a

534
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:03,590
smaller organization and they only have

535
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:05,430
let's say four or five testers they're

536
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,080
probably spread thin with

537
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:09,390
all of the clients and so if they have

538
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,949
to reschedule or expand the scope on the

539
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,530
fly let's say two or three days before a

540
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,330
test is supposed to kick off that's

541
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:17,670
really going to put the vendor in a bind

542
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:20,159
and I would expect you should probably

543
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:22,470
hear hey we just can't do that you know

544
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,240
or we need to schedule this out another

545
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,650
three months to make sure we have the

546
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,600
resources to actually cover this

547
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:29,070
additional scope oh and by the way this

548
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,189
exotic costing under ten thousand

549
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:34,710
dollars on the rescheduling the

550
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:38,460
last-minute rescheduling most vendors as

551
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:40,500
a safeguard for themselves usually what

552
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,950
they will do they will have a clause in

553
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:47,940
the Esso w that basically states hey if

554
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:50,070
you reschedule with us within within two

555
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,080
weeks of the testing start date we

556
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:54,030
previously agreed on we're going to

557
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,040
charge you an extra ten percent for your

558
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,810
tests to accommodate their resources

559
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,790
that we now have to find the other work

560
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:02,190
for so that's something else you might

561
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:03,840
look for in your also W that's a

562
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,730
question you would ask if you if you

563
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,129
know you're pushing a lot of code

564
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:10,860
changes and you're very prone to needing

565
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,910
to change things up last minute look for

566
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,159
that clause and have that conversation

567
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,050
up front with the vendor and ask them

568
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,360
hey can we remove this or can we reduce

569
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,980
this penalty cost because there is a

570
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,699
really fat chance that we're gonna have

571
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,800
to reschedule

572
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,290
last minute unfortunately because of the

573
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:29,520
way our environments are interacting

574
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:32,670
with and they of course validate your

575
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,500
scope to prevent scope creep that's

576
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:37,260
that's probably the number one thing you

577
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:40,500
can do is to validate your scope about

578
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:43,950
19 times before you sign the Esso w

579
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:46,200
agreement it is a contractual agreement

580
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:49,650
it doesn't mean that it cannot be

581
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:52,410
amended after the fact but it's better

582
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,940
to you know as with any project before

583
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:56,280
you start to make sure you have all your

584
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,860
ducks in a row before you fully commit

585
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:01,530
and you're actually providing a check to

586
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:05,669
a vendor to cash right a lot of vendors

587
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:08,190
will if it's a one-time test for you

588
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:10,950
that year they usually want to charge 50

589
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,580
percent upfront so whatever that total

590
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,590
cost may be

591
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,780
once the Esso W signed they're gonna

592
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:17,490
want to charge 50 percent of that total

593
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,980
cost that day or

594
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,330
sometime thereafter usually before the

595
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,250
engagement starts and then they will

596
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:25,110
charge you the other 50% of that cost

597
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,760
sometime after the engagement and the

598
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:30,559
final report has been provided to you

599
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,559
any questions so far

600
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:56,910
yes so for everybody else in the back

601
00:24:55,020 --> 00:25:00,420
the question was what would you expect

602
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:01,920
the difference between to be between as

603
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:04,020
far as number of hours of testing

604
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,270
between a white box and a black box test

605
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:08,400
okay let me go look at my next slide

606
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:18,929
because I think I touch on this a little

607
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:21,030
bit here we'll skip to that I'll cover

608
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:22,740
that right now though so I guess the

609
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:24,330
first question I asked I should ask to

610
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,070
lead up to that is does everybody

611
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:28,860
understand what white box grey box and

612
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:32,189
black box pen testing is you've at least

613
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:35,309
heard the terms okay so in a nutshell

614
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:36,780
white box is where you hire them whoever

615
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:38,820
may be and you give them everything

616
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:41,160
under the Sun all the way down to your

617
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,780
architecture diagrams internally to show

618
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,340
how your networks are mapped how your

619
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,520
applications are integrated together

620
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:50,280
black box is totally the opposite black

621
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,340
box is as close as you can get somebody

622
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:57,090
to actually act just like a real hacker

623
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:59,070
would where they have no info even that

624
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:01,050
may or may not include they may not even

625
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:02,280
have a website to start from you know

626
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:06,120
they may have to start with very basic

627
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:09,059
Oh sent just like any other real-world

628
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:12,389
attacker would grey box is like 50/50

629
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:14,850
right so number of hours between white

630
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:17,820
box and black box testing simplest

631
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:21,389
answer is I would expect to see black

632
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:24,240
box cost more hours because of the level

633
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:26,250
of research that same goes into it as

634
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,250
the first couple of days in the

635
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,059
engagement but I will also counter with

636
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,070
that

637
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:33,869
saying that it's up to you as the

638
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,359
organization to help determine how much

639
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:38,428
testing time right the reason I say that

640
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:40,739
is because a lot of organizations we

641
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:44,039
have budgets and as anybody who has

642
00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:46,820
anybody anybody new budgets Hawaiian

643
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:49,710
items so yeah this sucks terrible

644
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:53,700
terrible security people need unlimited

645
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:56,070
budgets okay unfortunately a lot of it

646
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,739
boils down to money which is where a lot

647
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:00,689
of companies get stuck and so they'll

648
00:26:58,739 --> 00:27:02,580
we'll start out in the pre engagement

649
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:05,519
the planning phase they'll get the draft

650
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:07,139
s o W and then they're back to Finance

651
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:08,609
internally a finance they look at it

652
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:11,309
before anything gets signed and they'll

653
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:14,580
say oh you know we're just test is gonna

654
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:16,769
cost $75,000 we're only gonna give you

655
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:19,879
30 figure out how to make it work

656
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:22,619
anybody ever run into that yes I

657
00:27:19,879 --> 00:27:26,789
everybody has everybody has everybody

658
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:30,749
has deals with budget so unfortunately

659
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:34,440
yes black box will usually take way more

660
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:37,849
man-hours to do the other part of black

661
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,440
box that's the that it's depending on is

662
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:42,839
what's the goal you want him to

663
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,839
accomplish if you want them to just do

664
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:48,690
whatever they can to break in if they

665
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:50,309
find anything significantly way more

666
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:52,109
hours right because they may or may not

667
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:53,399
find anything and so that's part of the

668
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:55,529
reason they have a capital in hours

669
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:57,089
right you know if they say a hundred and

670
00:27:55,529 --> 00:28:01,320
four hundred twelve hours of testing

671
00:27:57,089 --> 00:28:02,279
part of that cap is is it's because you

672
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,859
know they don't have the resources

673
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:07,080
usually to spend six months on one

674
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:08,908
customer engagement right and once that

675
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,099
customer has an unlimited budget which

676
00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:16,489
we just previously discussed nobody has

677
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:16,489
that does that answer your question

678
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:36,420
yes so so in for us we typically lean

679
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:38,940
towards white box testing a mixture of

680
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,890
gray box and white box testing partly

681
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,770
because of the number of regulations we

682
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:45,620
have to abide by a lot of the the

683
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,970
requirements we have to abide by require

684
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,709
not only all of our public stuff to be

685
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:52,590
tested but also our internal network

686
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:54,630
infrastructure to be tested right PCI is

687
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:57,179
a good one so for those of you familiar

688
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:58,860
with PCI you know about the network

689
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,150
segmentation testing that has to happen

690
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:02,790
twice a year right

691
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:04,020
that's all internal that's usually going

692
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,970
to be considered a white box test

693
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:08,280
because you have to give them access to

694
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,810
your internal stuff you have to give

695
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,200
them some kind of knowledge of how

696
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:15,389
everything is set up right

697
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:18,030
the way we approach application level

698
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:20,070
testing let's say in your case and your

699
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:21,960
example we have a web application that

700
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:24,689
the public uses to interact with our

701
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:28,230
organization in some fashion the way

702
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:29,670
that we scope those out the first thing

703
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,520
we do we bid to a minimum of three

704
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:34,560
vendors every time the way we we set

705
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,300
that up though is we actually control

706
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,879
the scoping questionnaire or scoping

707
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,350
document our vendors don't

708
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,420
that's probably different than what a

709
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:44,340
lot of you see usually the vendor will

710
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:46,380
provide you the scoping document with a

711
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:48,720
whole lot of questions technical

712
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,460
questions questions they want to ask you

713
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,850
to determine the scope of the test right

714
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:55,200
in order our organization we developed

715
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:57,120
our own questionnaire and we make our

716
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,740
vendors use that that is perfectly

717
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,379
acceptable and it's definitely good to

718
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,510
ask your vendors right because you may

719
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:05,190
know something they may not right if

720
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,720
they don't ask the right questions the

721
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:10,920
scope is going to be off web

722
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:15,030
applications we ask for the is there is

723
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:16,770
there a web UI yes or no is there are

724
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:21,210
there API endpoints because they're

725
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:22,320
tested similar fashion but not right you

726
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,940
have to ask different questions if

727
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,480
there's a web application that totally

728
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:30,420
consumes a web app API or multiple API

729
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,980
endpoints then you want to test through

730
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,250
the UI but you also want to test

731
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:37,230
directly against those endpoints right

732
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:40,830
you want to ask number of dynamic or

733
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:42,780
static web pages in your root domain of

734
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:45,840
that website right that's going to be

735
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:47,160
dependent it's gonna be a dependency to

736
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,560
determine the cost and number of hours

737
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,840
to do what you want to do right if you

738
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,760
go to them and say hey I've got 500

739
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,830
pages in or linked or embedded in this

740
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,920
one website they're probably gonna say

741
00:30:55,830 --> 00:31:02,070
okay well 200 hours 110 thousand dollars

742
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:05,100
we're good to go if you say well we only

743
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:07,560
have ten or five yeah it might only be a

744
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:10,439
ten thousand dollar test right API

745
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:12,899
endpoints number of calls and number of

746
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,210
methods those are totally dependent I've

747
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:18,240
seen api's that range up into hundreds

748
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:19,620
of methods and calls which is a massive

749
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,470
test especially when you combine

750
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:25,830
something like that with you know like a

751
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:29,580
slash 24 slash 23 subnet internally

752
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:31,770
that's a big test that's kind of how we

753
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,449
approach our our testing it's a good

754
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,910
mixture between white box and gray box

755
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:38,520
to make sure we're getting the best bang

756
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:44,640
for our buck right does that answer your

757
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:47,129
question okay perfect perfect so I had a

758
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,420
slide in here to talk about engagement

759
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,440
because that's the second phase right

760
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,630
once you make it through all this

761
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,360
pre-engagement mumbo-jumbo going in the

762
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:57,240
engagement when you hire a third party

763
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,219
vendor the growing job during the

764
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,080
engagement is just to look for updates

765
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:04,050
from the vendor that's it

766
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,030
simply put I mean unless they unless

767
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:08,460
they find something that's really really

768
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:12,450
significant like a critical or high

769
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:13,890
finding that's exposing lots of customer

770
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:19,470
data you know something that would

771
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:22,260
really be considered a like a true

772
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:24,270
incident that you need to involve some

773
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:27,360
kind of dfi our team to come in and

774
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:29,879
investigate very very rare but I'm sure

775
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,340
it does happen in those cases usually

776
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,140
the vendor will pick up the phone and

777
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,629
call you and say hey look we found this

778
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:38,480
we it's a huge concern we're not going

779
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:40,280
to proceed with testing until you

780
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,530
look into this and get back to us they

781
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,120
want positive confirmation before they

782
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,350
go any further and the test usually if

783
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,389
they find something like that which is

784
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:49,189
good right they're doing two things for

785
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:51,260
there they're doing their job what you

786
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:53,809
paid them to do but they're also giving

787
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,990
you a chance to deem that and a false

788
00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:58,639
positive or proceed with the F IR

789
00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:01,570
without them interfering

790
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,890
anybody who has anybody done forensics

791
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:05,720
okay the last thing you want when you

792
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:08,660
have a forensic investigation going on

793
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,429
is for a pen test company to be actively

794
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,650
pen testing your web apps or something

795
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:14,870
like that or your network and filling up

796
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:17,780
the logs and then you're losing evidence

797
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:19,428
right that is not good that's a really

798
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:23,210
good that's a really quick way to make a

799
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:27,860
forensic guy really upset so let's talk

800
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:31,910
about post engagement usually pen tests

801
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:33,379
and in my experience the reports you're

802
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:35,179
looking for the report right they

803
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:38,660
usually include a lot of findings or

804
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:42,350
next to no findings okay if you get a

805
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:44,690
report back how many people would get

806
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:46,820
nervous if you pay thirty five thousand

807
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:49,790
dollars for a pen test that lasts like

808
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:52,700
five days and got a PDF report back with

809
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:55,040
one finding it at one low finding who

810
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,900
would be nervous about the net yeah

811
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,280
naturally most people would write

812
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:02,000
because you're thinking your automatic

813
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:04,309
thought is what they do did they do

814
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,600
anything you know yeah I mean that's

815
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:08,389
usually the first reaction especially

816
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,850
when you know you're the person that has

817
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:12,350
to go to your VP and report those

818
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:14,509
findings because you know what they're

819
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:16,368
gonna ask you know most bps are looking

820
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:18,379
for those fancy colorful charts you know

821
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:20,869
criticals highs medium lows

822
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:22,699
informational you know all those shiny

823
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:25,010
colors that vulnerability management

824
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:27,350
automated systems usually show the nice

825
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:29,690
graphs that's not usually the case with

826
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:32,719
pen testing okay in the pin in the case

827
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:34,879
of pen testing it is not abnormal to get

828
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:37,009
reports back that only have one or two

829
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:39,379
low findings in them okay

830
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:42,230
part of the reason you're hiring that

831
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:44,239
vendor and some of this comes with

832
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:45,770
experience with vendors like learning

833
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:50,149
Whitman there's really produce good

834
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:51,829
quality work versus which ones don't

835
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:54,799
and unfortunately experience is the only

836
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:56,629
teacher in that area right it's not

837
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:59,420
abnormal they're doing what you hired

838
00:34:56,629 --> 00:35:01,220
them to do if they come back their name

839
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:04,249
and their credibility is going to be on

840
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:07,549
that report okay does anybody in here

841
00:35:04,249 --> 00:35:14,118
have clients that require them to share

842
00:35:07,549 --> 00:35:18,019
audit reports with them nobody okay okay

843
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:20,059
so so maybe one okay so that's one of

844
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:22,549
the things that we have to deal with so

845
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:25,910
every pin test that we do with a vendor

846
00:35:22,549 --> 00:35:29,089
all of our reports have to be able to be

847
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:30,558
shared with an external client okay and

848
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:31,788
we're going to talk about how we get

849
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:33,499
around some of that stuff because I'm

850
00:35:31,789 --> 00:35:35,150
sure a lot of you are thinking well if

851
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:36,919
we find a critical finding I don't want

852
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,420
to share that what a client you know

853
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,950
nobody wants to share that of the client

854
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,839
we have ways that we get around that

855
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:43,730
that still communicate what the clients

856
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:47,619
want I want to hear right and it's not

857
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:49,730
cheating by the way I promise but

858
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:50,839
pentesters it's not abnormal to get

859
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,910
reports back they only have one or two

860
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:54,769
findings it's also not abnormal to get

861
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:58,160
pin test reports back they have like 50

862
00:35:54,769 --> 00:36:00,859
findings in there okay I truthfully get

863
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,859
more nervous when I see reports there

864
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:06,230
are 40 and 50 pages long because my

865
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:09,078
first thought is holy crap I just paid

866
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:10,759
for vulnerability scan and then I start

867
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:13,430
looking through the findings to see what

868
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:15,380
they are if I start seeing a lot of well

869
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:17,960
we're running an outdated version of TLS

870
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:20,390
or we're missing the HSTs you might know

871
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,299
what HSCs is it's a secure header

872
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:24,499
configuration for web applications

873
00:36:22,299 --> 00:36:26,150
that's the kind of stuff that you're

874
00:36:24,499 --> 00:36:28,160
going to find in your vulnerability of

875
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:31,130
ulnar ability scans on your web apps

876
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,230
right I do not want to see that in my

877
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:35,720
Pincess reports because that's not what

878
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:38,660
I'm paying for in your pin test reports

879
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:42,848
in general and this is really skipping

880
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:45,348
to the last one pen testing is

881
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:47,839
exploiting vulnerabilities right

882
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:50,650
vulnerability management is identifying

883
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:53,569
vulnerabilities that may or may not be

884
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:56,930
exploitable so in your pin test reports

885
00:36:53,569 --> 00:37:00,200
you only want to see findings that are

886
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:01,940
actually exploitable and one of the

887
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,020
things you want to see as part of your

888
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:06,050
findings

889
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:09,860
from your vendors you want to see sample

890
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:12,680
payloads exact screenshots of how they

891
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:14,540
exploited those vulnerabilities number

892
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,180
one reason for that is is because you

893
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:19,340
need to be able to reproduce that if you

894
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:21,770
can't reproduce it then it's potentially

895
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:23,300
a false positive and it's time to go

896
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:26,060
back to the menu and have a discussion

897
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,980
with them to see where their concern is

898
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:30,410
or how they got that finding in the

899
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:32,510
first place right we do a lot of that

900
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:34,310
and that is perfectly normal

901
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,300
we have a lot of conversations post

902
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:37,370
engagement with our vendors to

903
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,840
understand how they found stuff simply

904
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:41,330
because a lot of times they'll find

905
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,220
stuff that that we didn't think about

906
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:45,620
they're thinking about attack scenarios

907
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,540
and testing those we just simply didn't

908
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:51,170
think about which is part of why you're

909
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:54,800
hiring them right who is related

910
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:58,280
findings I had one I had one vendor that

911
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:02,450
was really really heavy on putting it

912
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:04,070
who is findings in pen test reports and

913
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:06,649
it did not make it didn't make anybody

914
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:08,540
in my company happy so um everybody's

915
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:10,310
familiar with who is right through his

916
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,320
information you know it's usually

917
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:15,850
information like oh well I can map your

918
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,860
website you know domain to so-and-so

919
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:21,740
subnet addresses or I know who this

920
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:25,730
domains registered to or you know I know

921
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:28,939
what your ASN number is right terrible

922
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:30,410
non exploitable findings don't want to

923
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,020
see those in Pintas reports that's a

924
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:34,790
another really clear indicator there was

925
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,020
a lot of vulnerability scanning going on

926
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:38,300
because that's one of the things will

927
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:42,440
row the scans they do they do those who

928
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:44,900
is lookups right we talked about missing

929
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,250
header related findings again we don't

930
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:49,130
want to see those that's something that

931
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:51,530
your app scans will pick up very very

932
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:54,110
easily it's something that it's

933
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:58,580
something that enmet can do nowadays

934
00:38:54,110 --> 00:39:01,300
very very easily anything of course we

935
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:04,040
already chatted about non exploit

936
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,150
exploitable findings in general we don't

937
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,700
want to see those we want to see things

938
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:10,340
that attackers can actually exploit to

939
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:14,339
compromise our systems that's the entire

940
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:16,750
point of hiring a pen test vendor

941
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:17,950
so I'm gonna go back up because I know I

942
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,720
skipped a few of these

943
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:21,160
I've got about eleven and a half minutes

944
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,598
left I'm gonna try to finish up here in

945
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,680
about the next four minutes to make sure

946
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:30,190
we have time for additional questions

947
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,649
mapping your standards to a our mapping

948
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:34,000
your findings to a specific standard

949
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:37,509
those of you they have seen pin test

950
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,089
reports or vulnerability reports do you

951
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:42,720
typically see like the findings they map

952
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:47,440
to a standard like a wasp or NIST

953
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,069
controls okay let me ask this in a

954
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,140
different way

955
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:55,210
how many people have implemented some

956
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:58,598
form of the NIST framework okay how many

957
00:39:55,210 --> 00:40:00,789
people look at the OWASP top 10 when

958
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:06,150
they're doing any kind of security

959
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:09,910
reviewers assessment ok so last question

960
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:12,369
would it not be nice to see your book or

961
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:13,779
your pen test findings mapped to a

962
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:16,890
specific NIST

963
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:20,769
or a wasp control so you can identify

964
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:24,069
where your framework gaps are perp

965
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:26,740
intestine yes that's one of the things

966
00:40:24,069 --> 00:40:30,009
that we did as well that was not being

967
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:34,348
done that's one of the things by the way

968
00:40:30,009 --> 00:40:37,059
if you get in bed with a good vendor

969
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:39,910
then they're gonna do a lot of this

970
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:42,039
reporting next next to free they'll have

971
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:44,440
a flat rate cost for reporting in there

972
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:46,450
but if you go back and ask them hey I

973
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,430
know this is your default report format

974
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:53,129
but can you customize this a little bit

975
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:53,129
for us which leads to the next slide

976
00:40:54,809 --> 00:40:59,520
reporting

977
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:03,090
detailed exact summary what did you do

978
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:05,790
who did you hire right what did you hire

979
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:07,890
them for if they're testing a specific

980
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:10,259
web application for you and you have 90

981
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:13,799
web applications which one did they test

982
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:16,860
write detailed sample exploits or

983
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,210
payloads right you want to see the

984
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,260
payloads and we kind of touched on that

985
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:21,090
right because you want to be able to

986
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:23,760
replicate what they did if you can't

987
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:26,760
replicate it then it may or may not be a

988
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,440
false positive false positives in pen

989
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,440
test reports for those of you they have

990
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:34,170
to deal with PCI auditors you know like

991
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,550
PwC or internal auditors usually they're

992
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:38,460
going to ask for your pin test reports

993
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:40,650
as part of audit right one of the things

994
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,300
they're gonna ask and I'm picking on PCI

995
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:46,410
because PCI is a big one everybody knows

996
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:50,670
PCI right one of the things that we get

997
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:52,350
asked is is not only they ask would it

998
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:53,850
be test they want to make sure we tested

999
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:55,710
all of our public facing stuff but also

1000
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:58,410
our internal stuff right to meet PCI

1001
00:41:55,710 --> 00:42:00,300
controls but they also want to see how

1002
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:02,730
it was done right if we get a report

1003
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,260
back that just says hey we found you

1004
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:06,570
know social defense exploit or

1005
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:08,700
vulnerability on you know on this

1006
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:10,200
internal winx box and then they just

1007
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,029
provide you a brief description i'm

1008
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,879
maybe an olaf smacking to it and then

1009
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,470
that's it then you're not really getting

1010
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,600
any info from them they're not telling

1011
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:20,759
you how they did it they're not telling

1012
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,529
you how you can replicate it to test it

1013
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,470
to see if you need to fix it and they're

1014
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:27,450
also not telling you whether or not it's

1015
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:30,000
a false positive if you get a report

1016
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:32,160
back and you can prove to the vineyard

1017
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,510
it's a false positive it's totally worth

1018
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,859
going back to the vendor and saying hey

1019
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:36,660
look let's have a discussion on this

1020
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:40,530
because I think this is a false positive

1021
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:43,290
and or we have compensating controls in

1022
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:45,660
place for this that's a big one that's

1023
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:47,610
where your auditors will be very very

1024
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:50,509
happy with you if you can get the a

1025
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:53,640
finding reduce from a a high to a low

1026
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:55,770
which in some cases because of

1027
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,210
compensating controls you can get your

1028
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:58,740
vendors to do that but you have to

1029
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,970
provide them evidence because their name

1030
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:03,629
is on the report right that's a

1031
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:05,430
credibility issue for them that's where

1032
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:07,190
your audit really ties into your pen

1033
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:09,410
test reports

1034
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:11,150
and of course your standardized finding

1035
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:14,660
mappings your cbss everybody familiar

1036
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:16,520
with cbss usually if you're involved in

1037
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,920
going to be vulnerable to management in

1038
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:22,120
some way shape or form you see a CBS s

1039
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:25,420
score right it's on a one to ten scale

1040
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:28,069
higher the number the worse it is right

1041
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:30,050
that's usually associated there that's

1042
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:31,550
also where you want to start questioning

1043
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:34,610
well do I want these to be mapped to

1044
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:37,190
OWASP sure do I want to see the nist

1045
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:39,290
mapping there may be several hundred

1046
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:41,420
controls of NIST's which there are

1047
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:43,610
obviously right but it's a good way if

1048
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:45,440
you know use nist very heavily across

1049
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:46,940
your organization it's a good way to get

1050
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,920
a risk assessment from a pen test

1051
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:53,210
perspective that maps to nist controls

1052
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:56,750
right okay anything an overall risk

1053
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:59,330
reading it's nice to have the risk for

1054
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:01,970
each individual finding sometimes what I

1055
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:05,090
find is I'm gonna see an overall risk

1056
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:07,100
rating from from the vendor usually I

1057
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:08,750
have management teams that that want to

1058
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:11,060
see an overall risk high medium low

1059
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:13,880
based on the total number of findings

1060
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:17,330
and their combined individual risks

1061
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,830
right if you get that it can be a good

1062
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:21,200
thing but it can be kind of detrimental

1063
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:22,970
to you want to ask your vendors how they

1064
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,710
make up that risk or ask them about

1065
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:25,879
their risk rating system if it's

1066
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:28,130
something that kind of developed

1067
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,050
in-house on their own and ask them to

1068
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:32,150
provide you some solid documentation and

1069
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:34,970
reasoning behind how they're figuring

1070
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:37,550
out the risk or your findings right it

1071
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:39,500
may be way jacked up it may be way

1072
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,730
dingiest ooh it might be some you know

1073
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,160
something you haven't thought about that

1074
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:46,580
makes total sense right or they may have

1075
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:48,049
used some kind of stain or like cbss to

1076
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:52,069
assist them so they don't have to

1077
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:53,720
reinvent the wheel right I'm ending of

1078
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:55,970
course the detailed list of items

1079
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:59,120
usually in your in your reports you'll

1080
00:44:55,970 --> 00:45:01,220
see several appendices usually in your

1081
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:04,670
appendices is where you'll see the scope

1082
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:07,270
if it's not in the very beginning of the

1083
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:09,980
report like just under the exact summary

1084
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:11,630
usually in one of two places when you

1085
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:14,150
get to find a report back these are all

1086
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:16,790
things to look at and scrutinize right

1087
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:18,770
and then go back to the vendor and with

1088
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:20,869
any questions or concerns you might have

1089
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:22,609
right number

1090
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:24,140
reasoning is because you're paying for

1091
00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:26,210
it right you want to make sure you get

1092
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:29,598
the best bang for your buck but - it's a

1093
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:33,200
lessons learned for you and them both

1094
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:37,910
right no organization is exactly the

1095
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:39,979
same if all of us ran the same ABCD comm

1096
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:41,569
website I promise you every one of us

1097
00:45:39,979 --> 00:45:44,479
would deploy it and implement it and

1098
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:46,460
secure it in a different way so every

1099
00:45:44,479 --> 00:45:48,379
pin test is gonna be a little bit

1100
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:52,009
different right your controls might be

1101
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:55,779
implemented differently right any

1102
00:45:52,009 --> 00:45:55,779
questions on this particular slide yes

1103
00:45:56,589 --> 00:46:21,339
yes for that our vendors do map

1104
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:23,210
everything to see if SS CB SS

1105
00:46:21,339 --> 00:46:25,640
unfortunately our organization and

1106
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:28,549
totally disregards it because we map

1107
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:32,118
everything to NIST and wasp and NIST is

1108
00:46:28,549 --> 00:46:35,359
what all of our reporting up to our

1109
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:38,499
exact VP's that's it's it's all NIST

1110
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:42,049
based and so for us individually we're

1111
00:46:38,499 --> 00:46:44,538
we totally ignore the CMS CB SS coercing

1112
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:47,359
our reports most people wouldn't be that

1113
00:46:44,539 --> 00:46:48,769
way I can't really give you a solid

1114
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:52,400
answer to be balanced with you just

1115
00:46:48,769 --> 00:46:54,709
because we we don't use it I apologize

1116
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:59,479
if anybody is anybody else I have have

1117
00:46:54,710 --> 00:47:04,489
any experience in that they may and

1118
00:46:59,479 --> 00:47:07,390
maybe I need to repeat the question okay

1119
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:07,390
yes

1120
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:20,740
so if you look at the miss framework in

1121
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:23,410
800-53 and the document why the

1122
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:25,569
appendices list every missed control out

1123
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:29,100
there that that's in that document right

1124
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:31,690
and so what we have our vendors do is

1125
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:33,400
every time we hire them and they do an

1126
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:36,910
assessment we have them go through that

1127
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:41,020
entire list and they actually they pick

1128
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:42,790
out the the control that most closely

1129
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:45,100
fits the finding that they found and

1130
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:47,830
that's what they map it to there are

1131
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:49,870
usually about 95% right sometimes we

1132
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:56,170
have to go back and discuss it with them

1133
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:57,520
though I think that's where they use it

1134
00:47:56,170 --> 00:48:00,250
that's part of the reason they continue

1135
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:03,009
to use UCF s CBS s scores because that's

1136
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:05,110
where they can add risk rating from the

1137
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:07,480
NIST control doesn't necessarily give

1138
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:09,580
you a risk rating if that makes sense

1139
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:17,490
that did that helped a little bit at

1140
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:17,490
least okay okay okay lessons learned

1141
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:24,880
metrics is there anybody in here that

1142
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:25,569
does more than one pin test a year okay

1143
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,550
you guys

1144
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:29,680
okay so metrics are good to track you if

1145
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:32,170
you just want to just do it one test per

1146
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:35,589
year you want to see if you're seeing

1147
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:37,150
repeat findings if you're doing in-house

1148
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:39,970
web app development and you're seeing

1149
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:41,530
the same findings every pin test you

1150
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:47,709
might have a problem with your

1151
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:50,650
developers ask me how I know no

1152
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:52,090
seriously though this is a great way as

1153
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:54,790
part of lessons Lawrence to figure out

1154
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:57,340
where your gaps are in your skill sets

1155
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:59,529
and your knowledge with your staff it

1156
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:02,680
sees the same findings over and over

1157
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:07,180
it's that's a really good place to start

1158
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:10,240
first preventive measures all of our pen

1159
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:13,660
tests pre-engagement our sockets

1160
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:16,209
notified IP addresses destination source

1161
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:18,580
if we have detailed payloads which most

1162
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:19,260
the time we do our Sauk gets all of

1163
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,240
those because

1164
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:23,490
they can tune up and look for custom

1165
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:25,229
attacks and then that's our preventative

1166
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:28,979
measure so that integration is hugely

1167
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:30,060
important and then of course I'm going

1168
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:32,790
to skip to the last I talked about

1169
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:35,490
minute and 15 seconds to left give the

1170
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:37,890
vendors feedback okay I mentioned very

1171
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:39,839
first on in this presentation that

1172
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:41,850
several years ago there was a big

1173
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,560
problem with vendors saying yeah we do

1174
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:45,839
pen testing the thing you actually got a

1175
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:49,320
vulnerability scan right not so

1176
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:52,560
prominent today but vendors only know

1177
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:54,690
and only learn what they get from us as

1178
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:57,450
our clients the same way that we only

1179
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:59,490
know and learn from outside educational

1180
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:01,649
institutions and the feedback that we

1181
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:04,080
get from our clients and our staff right

1182
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:07,620
it's hugely important to talk to them

1183
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:10,470
openly if you can and help them learn to

1184
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:11,910
better themselves for future engagements

1185
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:14,040
it's only going to increase the quality

1186
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:16,649
for the the dollar amount that you're

1187
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:21,060
paying for them okay I'm gonna stop

1188
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:30,710
there I've got 25 seconds any additional

1189
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:30,710
questions yes this one here

1190
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:59,980
okay let me close out real quick and

1191
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:01,690
we'll chat on the side if that's okay

1192
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:03,580
thank you everybody thank you everybody

1193
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:10,440
for coming out thank you so much

1194
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:10,440
[Applause]
