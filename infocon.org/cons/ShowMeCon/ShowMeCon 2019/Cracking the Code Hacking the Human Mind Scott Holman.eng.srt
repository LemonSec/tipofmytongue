1
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:26,360
hello everybody we're gonna get started

2
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,310
with this talk this is cracking the code

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,630
how do f coy hack the human mind with

4
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,669
Scott Holman

5
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,230
basically he's gonna be our soft skills

6
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,030
speaker for the evening he's gonna teach

7
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,440
you how to get buy-in from everybody you

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:45,260
need to in your organization for

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:47,390
security excellent

10
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,420
get the ovations early that way I can't

11
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:54,080
mess it up hey this morning I read that

12
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:56,600
from the CEO of LinkedIn that the

13
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,000
greatest skills gap in America now has

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,559
to do with soft skills has nothing to do

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,360
with the hard skills anymore has nothing

16
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,819
to do with coding has nothing to do with

17
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,560
IT all these areas that once upon a time

18
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,990
or where everyone needed to exist it's

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,909
moved now we have corporations across

20
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,759
America that have no clue or have

21
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:16,010
individuals inside that have very little

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,340
clue how to deal with other individuals

23
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:22,210
in order to ultimately get what needs to

24
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,950
be done in the organization complete

25
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,570
we're growing up in a world and this

26
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,740
will help stay off the soapbox but we're

27
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,500
growing up in a world where quite

28
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,810
frankly many of us are being raised in

29
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,469
homes where we don't necessarily get to

30
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:39,079
see what a real relationship looks like

31
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:40,729
we're growing up in and and family

32
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:43,189
environments that are not always the

33
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:46,039
best case scenario and so what we have

34
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:48,199
is a group set of people that are moving

35
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:51,880
into the business and corporate life and

36
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:55,670
we just don't know how to deal with

37
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:58,070
relationship whether good bad conflict

38
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,710
whatever the case may be so that's the

39
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:02,119
purpose of today is just to talk about

40
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,589
some of the soft skills and how to

41
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:05,179
connect with people how to relate to

42
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,210
people and ultimately how to persuade

43
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:10,610
people last year I don't remember her

44
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:14,120
name but there was a speaker she was the

45
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:16,190
very first speaker here and she got up

46
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,740
and did a talk about how important it is

47
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:23,000
for each and every one of us to get the

48
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:24,950
buy-in of our executives so that we can

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,190
accomplish the goals that we believe we

50
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:30,679
need to accomplish as I looked around

51
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,010
and looking at my background I realized

52
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,310
many of us in this room

53
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,890
our technology people not necessarily

54
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,840
people people and how many in here would

55
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,458
raise your hand admit I know that I need

56
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,690
to get executive buy-in in order to

57
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,250
accomplish the goals I want to

58
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,230
accomplish within my organization

59
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:50,090
now how many would keep your hands up

60
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:53,250
and say that's an easy task it's not

61
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,410
it's not at all because now I got to get

62
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,379
their attention and I have to persuade

63
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,660
them that what I think is important

64
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,790
should be important to them and I have

65
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,220
to continue that relationship with them

66
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,310
so that we can ultimately accomplish

67
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,230
those goals over time and that is the

68
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,709
whole point of this talk today is just

69
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:16,379
to show a few insights on how that can

70
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,120
be done or maybe just one aspect that

71
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:21,690
you can apply to how you're handling

72
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,480
your job your career and maybe you can

73
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,940
just use that as a tool so you can

74
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:32,910
accomplish your goals that you have I

75
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:34,940
need to get this little hear a little

76
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:38,459
bit about me and I will be brief

77
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,709
ironically Valerie over there when she

78
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,560
was talking about access control yeah

79
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,180
that's what I do everybody my background

80
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,569
this 20 plus years in the physical

81
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,849
security space I actually have spent 20

82
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:52,980
years as a systems integrator an Account

83
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:55,679
Manager working with large corporations

84
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,630
on applying the systems needed to

85
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,190
protect the building I've been doing

86
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,109
access control I've been doing video

87
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,720
surveillance alarm systems intercom

88
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:06,150
systems all of that for again 20 plus

89
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,419
years I came to show me con 3 years ago

90
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:13,079
because I realized something do not tell

91
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:14,970
my bosses I said this I realized that

92
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,639
the same exact devices that we're

93
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,829
putting in place to protect a facility

94
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,180
in the assets of a corporation in many

95
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,710
cases are one of the largest

96
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,070
vulnerabilities for the cyber

97
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:28,109
professional it is one of the entry

98
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,229
doors to someone who may actually want

99
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,960
to hack a facility if that system was

100
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,669
not put in correctly if it was not

101
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,020
locked down correctly and of course

102
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:40,380
that's what we just heard a few hours

103
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,770
ago that's what brings me here I'm an

104
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,249
Account Manager a relationship manager

105
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,188
educator coach and part of the John max

106
00:04:45,249 --> 00:04:49,359
team and so I speak on leadership

107
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:52,959
persuasion connection things of that

108
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:55,739
nature now today we're going to talk

109
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,819
about the power of connection and

110
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:59,859
applying some of these principles to

111
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:03,579
your life there's a book out there

112
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:06,779
called big potential by shawn Achor in

113
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:09,789
the very first chapter talks about a

114
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:12,389
biologist Hugh Smith who is in the main

115
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:15,159
growth forests of Southeast Asia and

116
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:17,860
when he was in there on this River it

117
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:21,188
was late at night very dark couldn't see

118
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:24,309
a thing and then out of nowhere a tree

119
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:27,069
flashed and he described it as if

120
00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:28,929
lightning shot out from the tree not

121
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:31,239
lightning hitting the tree but rather

122
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:33,308
like Lightning flashing out of the tree

123
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:35,109
of course that drew his attention into

124
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:37,659
the forest and he said within seconds

125
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:40,989
the tree flashed again and then other

126
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:44,429
trees started to flash until ultimately

127
00:05:40,989 --> 00:05:46,748
the whole Riverside was one big flash

128
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:51,159
anybody got an idea what the flash might

129
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:52,479
have been fireflies and this led him

130
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:55,779
down an avenue of learning about

131
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,179
fireflies Oh or this particular species

132
00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:01,769
of Firefly and what he learned disease

133
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:05,679
fireflies synchronize with each other

134
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:07,989
these fireflies will look basically at

135
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:10,388
the Firefly next to them and they will

136
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:12,578
begin to match their light and it will

137
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:14,589
flash at the same time and of course I

138
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:17,019
guess thousands millions I don't know

139
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:18,969
the actual number over time looking at

140
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:22,419
the next one you start getting these

141
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:24,269
large bursts of light now ironically in

142
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:28,029
their study what he learned was this is

143
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:29,289
that the reason these males flash their

144
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:31,149
light of course is basically they're

145
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:33,849
trying to find the female or allowing

146
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:36,909
the female to find them and what they

147
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:40,209
learned is that a Firefly that flashes

148
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:43,119
its light randomly has a three percent

149
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:46,509
chance of success in a female finding

150
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:52,599
him that's pretty low lot feel sorry for

151
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:55,630
those guys those that synchronize their

152
00:06:52,599 --> 00:07:02,020
flash their odds

153
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:05,050
success increase up to 82% it's pretty

154
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:07,659
astounding pretty astounding that that

155
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,570
one would believe that by flashing in a

156
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:12,700
group which could be considered

157
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:14,650
competition is ultimately better than

158
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,780
trying to do your own thing and I think

159
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,940
what we can learn by that is we need

160
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,250
people we need the cooperation of people

161
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:24,550
and we live in a society here really in

162
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:27,190
America that we focus on can everyone

163
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,980
see me okay right if I come down we live

164
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:32,350
in a society in America that we focus on

165
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,940
the whole idea that it's about me I want

166
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:36,580
to be the best I want to be the one in

167
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,750
charge but what we see through fireflies

168
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,849
teaching us and really all the

169
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,830
statistics by working together in the

170
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,960
power of cooperation and flashing

171
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:48,729
together we will ultimately have greater

172
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:51,340
success in life we will not only shine

173
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:53,980
brighter and ourselves but our entire

174
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,979
teams will shine brighter if we get

175
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,660
better at working together now I know

176
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,800
we're technology people so maybe you're

177
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,020
saying I don't really care about

178
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:07,630
fireflies so let's put it in a different

179
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:10,510
way can anyone tell me what this is it's

180
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:12,909
a diagram of what I got IT professionals

181
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:17,039
come on someone help me it's a network

182
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:19,360
what kind of network it's a peer-to-peer

183
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,870
at least that's what the pictures tell

184
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,760
me I'm not a network guy okay I'm gonna

185
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,410
openly admit I'm one of those who's been

186
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,659
a physical security I know just enough

187
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:30,400
to be dangerous but I don't know your

188
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,770
language but I've always heard of

189
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,780
networks and I know the principle of a

190
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:38,380
peer-to-peer network and a peer-to-peer

191
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:41,049
network is based on computer nodes in

192
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,750
essence working together so in this

193
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:45,729
scenario there is no master server that

194
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,250
has all the information that's feeding

195
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,740
each and every computer its computer

196
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,990
gets its knowledge and information from

197
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:56,560
the other computers that is ultimately

198
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:58,980
connected with to simplify and again

199
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,119
this is just to try to don't judge my

200
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,580
technology knowledge here this is just

201
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:08,290
to simplify the concept to simplify this

202
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:09,430
in essence if one computer has some

203
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:12,160
knowledge

204
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,500
and it connects to another college that

205
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,100
has another computer with a different

206
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:20,770
set of knowledge both computers

207
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,290
ultimately get smarter is that correct

208
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:26,710
you can go with that logic and if I can

209
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,180
continue to connect to other nodes the

210
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,740
more and more I connect to the more

211
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:33,489
diverse of the information the more

212
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:35,560
diverse the knowledge in theory I get

213
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,450
smarter and smarter the more I connect

214
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,000
with other computers can everyone go

215
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:44,020
with that I want to show another

216
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,580
peer-to-peer network this one is with

217
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:51,130
human beings here my peer you're my peer

218
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,400
how many's heard the phrase jack of all

219
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:56,770
trades master of none how many like

220
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,150
being a jack of all trade anyone in here

221
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,890
openly admit I'm a jack of all trades

222
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:02,140
master none all right don't get mad at

223
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:04,330
me I would kind of consider myself this

224
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,410
and but I'm a recovering one I'm one

225
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,760
that likes to try to do everything

226
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,530
myself because I'm actually kind of

227
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,300
cheap all right I don't like to pay

228
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,770
people for stuff I can figure it out in

229
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,240
fact I had a guy at Home Depot told me

230
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,010
the other day he's like you know what I

231
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,750
quit hiring people to do this stuff I

232
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,580
can do just as bad a job as they do and

233
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,900
I can do it myself and I thought that

234
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,130
was kind of funny and I feel the same

235
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,199
way but what I've actually come to

236
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:26,350
realize is I only have so much mental

237
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,130
power I only have so much time and so

238
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:32,560
for me to ultimately become better I

239
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:34,360
can't learn it all I can't be a jack of

240
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,719
all trades master of none in fact I

241
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,820
really need to be a master of some and

242
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,860
forget the other stuff and what I need

243
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:45,010
to do is I need to connect what you name

244
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,240
I need to connect the Bob who's a master

245
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,980
at some other stuff

246
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,720
maybe his personality is different than

247
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,180
mine maybe I'm not good with details

248
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,430
maybe bob's good with details I need to

249
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,290
connect with Bob and then Bob helps me

250
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,790
and I get better and Bob gets better

251
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,680
because we have different skill sets and

252
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,150
we've learned to work together and I can

253
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,199
go on through the room everybody get it

254
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:06,520
and that's exactly how we must find

255
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,560
ourselves within the organizations and

256
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,439
really life in general if we work

257
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,689
together and become masters at some or

258
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,310
masters even at one we're ultimately

259
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,310
gonna shine brighter

260
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:24,709
so here's what I hope to do I hope to

261
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:29,540
show you how each and every one of us

262
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:32,180
can add people or nodes into our network

263
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:36,079
our own personal network because with

264
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:37,790
each person we add ultimately we shine

265
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,559
brighter how many would like a raise

266
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:43,368
this year how many would like a

267
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:46,339
promotion how many would like just to be

268
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:48,170
known for something more you can figure

269
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:50,389
out what you want how you want to define

270
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:52,099
success success is truly defined within

271
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:54,230
each individual I strongly believe that

272
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,449
but what you will find is your success

273
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,459
is only going to be achieved by the

274
00:11:56,449 --> 00:12:02,089
power of your own personal peer-to-peer

275
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:03,378
network and so this intimidates some are

276
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:05,389
there any in here that would openly

277
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:08,569
admit that you are not natural when it

278
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:10,279
comes to dealing with people it's kind

279
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:12,229
of awkward for me I really don't like it

280
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:13,879
maybe we'll take it a step further

281
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,679
maybe you feel comfortable with your

282
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:18,559
friends and family but when it comes to

283
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:22,459
meeting someone new how many just love

284
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:25,730
that I mean it's good that's great how

285
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:27,829
many seriously today you have sat by

286
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,839
someone you did not know and you've had

287
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:34,670
a genuine conversation with them and got

288
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,589
to know them in the back I see one hand

289
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,878
she literally pulled me out earlier

290
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,110
downstairs instead of talking to me I

291
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:44,720
was really proud of you by the way and

292
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:45,800
that was fantastic my goal today is

293
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,259
actually to let you know it's really not

294
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,969
that hard we tend to look at life in

295
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:52,579
relationships as being something that's

296
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:55,429
natural for people and I actually argue

297
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:57,620
that it's not natural I argue that those

298
00:12:55,429 --> 00:12:59,600
who appear to be natural when it comes

299
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,249
to connection and relationship it's

300
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,470
really not natural it's that they were

301
00:13:01,249 --> 00:13:05,629
brought up an environment in an

302
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:09,860
environment that allows them to feel

303
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:12,799
like it was natural which really leads

304
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:15,259
me to my theory that all relationship is

305
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:17,629
not necessarily natural but it is a

306
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:19,759
science a science that can be learned

307
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:21,829
just like any of the other technology

308
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:24,980
that we learn about it is a science that

309
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:27,439
has hard principles because our mind as

310
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:32,070
complex as it is all the research shows

311
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:34,709
that certain inputs always equal certain

312
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:36,600
outputs why do you think marketing if

313
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:39,030
you watch commercials on TV or anything

314
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:44,610
of that nature guys it is set with a

315
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:47,579
principle it has hard data tied to it

316
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:50,640
because it knows that by presenting this

317
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:55,440
information in this way human brain will

318
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:57,090
react in this way so my goal again just

319
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,000
not learn today I want you to pull

320
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:03,060
yourself back and say hey if this in

321
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,370
fact is a science then maybe I can learn

322
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:09,500
a little bit take out one detail today

323
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:11,220
and get a little better at this now I

324
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,040
love this one

325
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:17,220
wreck-it Ralph just because you're a bad

326
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:20,099
guy doesn't mean you're a bad guy why is

327
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:23,700
this up here because what I just said

328
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,830
actually scares some people if hacking

329
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,440
the human mind as I called it there is

330
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,970
in fact the possibility and a science

331
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,140
that can be learned or an art that can

332
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,730
be learned if you want to look at it

333
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:37,949
that way that scares a lot of people

334
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,960
because if I know that I can do certain

335
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:44,400
things and get a certain response from

336
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:46,320
Bob isn't that manipulation and so that

337
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,520
begins to scare human beings and they

338
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,790
say wait wait a minute

339
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,170
I don't know how I feel about that but I

340
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,150
want to challenge each and every one of

341
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:56,209
you in this room what kind of conference

342
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:59,220
is this somebody yell it out

343
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:01,560
it's a hackers conference in fact three

344
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:05,100
years ago I walked away with the term

345
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:08,790
and ethical hackers conference ethical

346
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,080
hacker all right just because you know

347
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,199
how to hack does that mean you do bad

348
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,700
things not at all

349
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,990
just because I know how to interact with

350
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,700
human beings and I know the science

351
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,170
behind it does that mean I manipulate

352
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,930
not at all

353
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:23,939
it comes down to your intention so I

354
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,949
really just want to put this out put

355
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,870
that fear aside it's okay

356
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,880
to learn the science and it's okay to

357
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,590
use it the st. Louis Blues they want to

358
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,320
hear they won the Stanley Cup you guys

359
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:38,010
heard that yeah absolutely you know what

360
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,980
those guys won the Stanley Cup because

361
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:43,680
they practiced their art they practice

362
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,240
their trade and they got better and it's

363
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,040
no different in this

364
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,410
you know if you want to be good at the

365
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:54,630
people trade you have to practice your

366
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:58,290
art and just know how it works how many

367
00:15:54,630 --> 00:16:00,540
know what the pretext is why in the

368
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:03,930
world would I be bringing pretext into

369
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:08,089
this conversation pretext

370
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:11,430
I love the definition it's a half lie

371
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:14,160
it's a half lie to present yourself as

372
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,479
something that you may not fully be but

373
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,810
you want people to believe that you are

374
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,640
often used in social engineering often

375
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,899
used in a phishing attack basically

376
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,350
you're trying to get someone to believe

377
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:26,550
that you are someone that you are not I

378
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:29,540
know this is a little dangerous but I

379
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:31,709
want you to follow me for a moment

380
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:38,250
relationship getting good at this all

381
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:43,920
starts with the pretext when I was 14 I

382
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:45,690
was one of the shyest kids around I can

383
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,279
go back into my grade school age and I

384
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,870
can tell you when I got classes and how

385
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,000
getting glasses I started getting made

386
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,649
fun of for glasses and then my parents

387
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,390
didn't have much money in the glasses I

388
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:55,890
did have I think my parents were just

389
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:58,290
trying to keep me ugly quite frankly

390
00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:00,689
they gave me weird haircuts I just did

391
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:03,390
not have confidence I was shy I was all

392
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:05,040
kinds of things and around the age of 14

393
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:07,619
I got contacts so that made me feel a

394
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,040
little better and I was going to this

395
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:12,809
camp it was a church camp for a week and

396
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:15,270
my brother he had just read something

397
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:17,819
about the fact that if you can convince

398
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,709
your mind that you're not shy and you

399
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:21,270
can just overcome that shyness and all

400
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:22,620
of a sudden your body will believe it

401
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,589
and other people will start to believe

402
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:26,729
it too well that's interesting I don't

403
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:29,639
know if I really believe it but I tried

404
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:32,040
it so what I did is I basically created

405
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,990
a pretext for myself I created this new

406
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:37,830
pretext for my brain that you know what

407
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:40,050
I am pretty cool I am handsome people

408
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,020
like me think about the Saturday Night

409
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:46,340
Live from years ago

410
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:50,160
and you know what's funny I got the camp

411
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:51,449
and I shook hands with someone I really

412
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,890
got brave and I even went up to some

413
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,010
girls and talked the girls and I never

414
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:58,140
talked the girls and at the end of the

415
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,430
week they presented an award at this

416
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,740
they stopped that last year I think

417
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,180
people got offended but they used to

418
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,980
have an award at the end of that where

419
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,600
is basically the most popular award they

420
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,310
had for the senior high students there

421
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,439
was Camp King and then there was Camp

422
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,909
Queen and can't print and really all it

423
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,280
was was the most popular award it was

424
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:20,040
all by vote and guess who got camp

425
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:22,710
Prince that year yeah it's great memory

426
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:26,639
but you know what it taught me it's all

427
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:28,890
up here the pretext is all up here it's

428
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,080
about us being able to convince

429
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:34,470
ourselves that maybe we're not the

430
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,929
person we think we are maybe we can be

431
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:39,330
different and then we have to determine

432
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:41,280
who that is so maybe if you want to

433
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,139
connect with the executive there's an

434
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,970
executive you need to connect with to

435
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,160
start getting the buy-in you need for

436
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,870
your objectives to be met you need to

437
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,380
sit there and say what is he looking for

438
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:54,959
in an individual and if you're not that

439
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:57,690
person I want you to try to mentally

440
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,420
take on the role of the person you think

441
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:02,550
you need to be and get past your own

442
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:05,700
limiting beliefs and try it out now I'm

443
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:07,889
not saying be fake I'm saying lie to

444
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,510
yourself slightly get a pretext so your

445
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,980
mind and body begin to believe what

446
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,960
you're telling it and ultimately what

447
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:16,590
you will find is you will because you'll

448
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,870
kind of become that person that you feel

449
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,459
like you need to be in the first place

450
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:21,780
that's why I have the little mask up

451
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,920
here if you remember the movie and I

452
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,420
don't even remember a whole lot of

453
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,190
details of the movie all I remember is

454
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,480
that that mask would come on him it

455
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,910
would grip his face and he would become

456
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,560
a different person now

457
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:34,110
probably again around the same age of

458
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:37,350
the camp Prince I was very involved in

459
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:38,520
our church still involved in church but

460
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,199
at that time we had a puppet in the

461
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,389
clown ministry and they needed a clown

462
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,610
and so I decided I would be a clown and

463
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,500
so I took on the learning and education

464
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:48,330
of a clown and I learned how to get a

465
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,340
costume and learn how to do the makeup

466
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,470
and I learned how to come up with a

467
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:55,230
character in essence and become that

468
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,470
person and what I learned over time was

469
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,570
real

470
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,820
and my wife when she met me absolutely

471
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:02,658
hated it when I go through the process

472
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:05,129
of basically putting on that clown

473
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:07,559
putting on that makeup putting on that

474
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:09,929
outfit you know what's interesting I

475
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:13,080
find it very difficult to talk to you in

476
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:15,570
a normal voice it's almost like the new

477
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,889
character can take over and I know this

478
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,450
sounds weird he's like you know dude

479
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:21,299
what's this guy talking about I promise

480
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:24,960
you if you trust me in this this one

481
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:26,700
fact you can convince your mind to be a

482
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,860
little different than what you think you

483
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:32,070
are right now if you're struggling with

484
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,719
confidence just try to be bold and say

485
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:36,510
you know what I'm not that person I'm

486
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,280
not shy I belong if you need to dress

487
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,350
differently in order to feel that way

488
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,730
dress differently if you need to do

489
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,520
something different with your hair or

490
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,080
makeup do something different but become

491
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,480
that person and you will find that you

492
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,299
can change and that may just be what you

493
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,760
need to do in order to have that initial

494
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:58,350
connection because now you believe that

495
00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:00,210
you can so let's talk about how to

496
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,070
actually connect this this whole purpose

497
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,840
now is to if you remember the people all

498
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,879
around is talking about how we can add

499
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,010
people to our nose all right we want to

500
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,770
add people to this network and what if

501
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:13,980
you can remember this principle you'll

502
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:18,059
be in good shape people do business with

503
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:19,650
people they know like and trust that's

504
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:23,820
what you're going to hear most often I

505
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:26,580
actually add and respect because I

506
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,860
believe know has two different ways of

507
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,299
looking at it I can know you in the

508
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,770
sense it Bob and I know each other right

509
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,299
now maybe we could have a short

510
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:35,190
conversation we kind of know each other

511
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:37,379
and that may be helpful but to really

512
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,700
know each other it takes a little bit of

513
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,980
time and I'm going to tell you that no

514
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,360
one really cares to know someone too

515
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,720
deeply if they don't respect you

516
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:48,750
so we need to know like trust and

517
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,400
respect and so in order to get support

518
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:53,520
from people we need to be able to

519
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,020
present that to others and I have to be

520
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,590
able to convince you that you want to

521
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,500
know me

522
00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:01,500
you want to like me you want to trust me

523
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,270
and you want to respect me here's the

524
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,210
scary part everyone this happens within

525
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:10,850
seven seconds of your first meeting

526
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,850
first impressions are set within

527
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,700
hey that slide disappear

528
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:19,419
first impressions are set within seven

529
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:21,850
seconds in seven seconds you make a

530
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:24,070
decision when you meet someone of how

531
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:26,620
smart they are you typically make a

532
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,629
decision if you like them if they look

533
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,030
trustworthy and if you actually want to

534
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:33,549
have a conversation with them and in

535
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:34,750
seven seconds that quick you've already

536
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:38,200
made a decision if you're going to

537
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:40,270
connect or not that's crazy don't you

538
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,760
think but you sit there and say well if

539
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:44,350
that's true and all the research shows

540
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,658
that it is true and if you think about

541
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:49,299
it I mean really look through today and

542
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:51,159
look at go back and say I spotted this

543
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:53,139
person and ask yourself what you thought

544
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:54,850
about that person just snap judgments

545
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:58,169
and you will realize you made those snap

546
00:22:54,850 --> 00:23:01,510
judgments in seconds and it has dictated

547
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:04,000
how you have responded in kind to that

548
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,590
person today so what we need to do is be

549
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,360
able to mind that first impression we

550
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:09,760
need to be able to say how can I ensure

551
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,289
that in those seven seconds I am putting

552
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,620
off the impression that you want to know

553
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,299
me

554
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:16,989
you want to like me you want to trust me

555
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:18,940
and you want to respect me guys this is

556
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:21,880
basic stuff every one of us have have

557
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:24,460
heard it but I'm telling you if you can

558
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,760
apply this you will at least get to

559
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:30,510
second base

560
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:33,549
can you please smile every now and then

561
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:35,200
seriously we go around life and we sit

562
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:37,870
there with this grimace on and less

563
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,960
horrible and nobody likes people who are

564
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:45,459
boring but no one likes people who don't

565
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:47,409
have fun we like people who seem happy

566
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,720
the worst thing you can do is say hey

567
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:52,240
how are you and then hear all of life's

568
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,419
draining stories you're like sorry sorry

569
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,700
I asked right no let's be real you want

570
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:59,770
to see the happy side hey how are things

571
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,140
man two blows one last night it's

572
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:03,610
fantastic and maybe you're looking at me

573
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,789
saying this guy's off its rocker but the

574
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:10,418
reality is that comes off as likable

575
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:13,179
because I'm smiling I'm happy and I

576
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:15,580
passed that test the second one is eye

577
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:17,020
contact a lot of us miss this and a lot

578
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,789
of this has to do with our own personal

579
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,860
confidence so well back to our pretext

580
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:22,250
am i confident enough to look at you

581
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,100
straight in the eye when I come this

582
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,060
take your hand because when I do that

583
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,800
anyone ever looked at someone in the eye

584
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,310
and almost felt something in your heart

585
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:33,620
you're like dude we just connected

586
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:34,250
anyone okay at least I'm not the only

587
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,899
weird one

588
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,960
there is something about that eye

589
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:41,720
contact that all of a sudden says man

590
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,390
I'm legit and when I do that we become

591
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:49,270
familiar with one another creating the

592
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:53,090
likability standpoint firm handshake

593
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:56,450
you know what that symbolizes I'm not

594
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:59,179
hiding anything you can trust me I'm

595
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:01,160
confident and you can trust me and then

596
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:05,990
finally our body language and dress

597
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:07,220
really does matter this is something

598
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,540
that we don't always like because we

599
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,010
live in an age where we tell everybody

600
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,260
that they can be anything they want to

601
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:14,450
be you can dress any way you want you

602
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,670
can act any way you want you can look

603
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,620
any way you want and by golly the world

604
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:20,660
just has to deal with you and that is

605
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,550
fantastic in theory but I'm going to

606
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:25,280
tell you something every one of us make

607
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:26,810
judgments all the time and the reality

608
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,629
is again if you're honest with yourself

609
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:33,080
you're going to say I make judgments

610
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:34,160
based on the way people look I'll share

611
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,490
an example with you

612
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:39,500
if you wear a suit and tie typically I

613
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:41,240
will automatically assume that you're an

614
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,750
executive or a high-powered position

615
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,880
within an organization what basis do I

616
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,770
have to put that on anyone else join me

617
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,380
on that one

618
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:54,080
why there's no basis on it because they

619
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,790
presented themselves in that manner now

620
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,199
if I'm the president of a company and

621
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,760
I'm going around in sweatpants that's

622
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,810
great that's my prerogative but how many

623
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,310
are going to say me and that's the

624
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:05,000
president of so-and-so if you don't know

625
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:08,060
them you're not so really the way we

626
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,010
present ourself also matters if you want

627
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,600
to get respective executives and guess

628
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:13,129
what they dress up in suit and ties at

629
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,790
your organization you want to know how

630
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:18,890
to do it dress up a little bit if you

631
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:21,560
want to get respective you name your

632
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:24,110
group you kind of have to dress to who

633
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:26,450
you are trying to connect with because

634
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:28,159
it matters to who you are your body

635
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,420
language is important again I can come

636
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,710
in and I can be slumped over and you

637
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,330
guys going to be like who's this where I

638
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,590
can stand up straight and firm and

639
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,760
you're going to make judgments on my

640
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,610
confidence level you're going to make

641
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,879
judgments on

642
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:40,860
how happy I am today or or how how much

643
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,549
I believe my own information all of this

644
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:45,629
based on the body language now every one

645
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:48,660
of you in this room have heard this

646
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:50,100
stuff million its times but what I

647
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,890
encourage you to do is take one of those

648
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:56,000
and try to apply it and see if it works

649
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,990
for you get past the first seven seconds

650
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,520
the next thing when it comes to

651
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:03,380
connection guess what we like people

652
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:07,170
that we are we like people were like

653
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:09,120
guys this is so important a year ago I

654
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:11,100
went on a cruise with my wife and we

655
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,168
were celebrating an anniversary and I

656
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,760
remember that I was sitting at a food

657
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:16,890
court and I was waiting in this long

658
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,070
line and ended up looking at the person

659
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:21,870
next to me and said hey how are you and

660
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,879
and they just answered something where

661
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,639
are you from I'm from Missouri you're

662
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:30,110
from Missouri and all of a sudden we

663
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,880
connected I know someone from Missouri a

664
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:34,770
simple fact of knowing someone from the

665
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,410
same state and all of a sudden I decided

666
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:40,350
I liked them it's ridiculous

667
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:41,580
but it's true I was telling that story

668
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,990
to someone the other day and they

669
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,939
laughed they said you know I did the

670
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,650
same exact thing he said but I took it

671
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,150
further you actually just kind of left

672
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:50,520
that conversation went on did your own

673
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,870
thing I ended up hanging with guys that

674
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,730
I would never hang with in my entire

675
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,260
life I spent nights with him at the bars

676
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,210
I did things that I never would have

677
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,309
done because they were from the same

678
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:02,040
state as me and I liked them it's a

679
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:04,889
likeability factor now maybe that's hard

680
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,389
to get maybe same States not enough but

681
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,830
the key I'm trying to tell you is the

682
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:10,559
way we can connect with someone in

683
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:13,559
likeability is find out what we share in

684
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:17,490
common how can I find out what we share

685
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:17,879
in common any guesses for me who said

686
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,460
that

687
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,140
ask questions everybody quit talking

688
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,299
about yourself if you really want to

689
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:28,049
connect with people shut up stop talking

690
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:30,410
about yourself and ask questions what do

691
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:33,179
you like where'd you get that blues hat

692
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:34,890
you don't actually how many kids do you

693
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:37,770
have three kids

694
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:40,559
oh man what ages

695
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:41,990
oh man you're dealing with that college

696
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,610
life stuff aren't you

697
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:46,410
uh-huh all out well I'm trying to go

698
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:48,990
with this is if I keep asking questions

699
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:51,420
we're going to hit on something that

700
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,830
brings us some similarities I didn't

701
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:55,200
want to just stick on blues fan that was

702
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:57,720
too easy but I can follow this until we

703
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,300
hit a thread a thread of commonality and

704
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,429
once we hit that thread then I can just

705
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,409
keep asking questions and following this

706
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:06,420
thread and by time that five-minute

707
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:09,360
conversation is done I will almost

708
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:11,970
assure you what's your name then and

709
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:15,178
Scott will be friends because we share

710
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:24,090
common points and we like people who are

711
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:27,000
like us just because right anyone going

712
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,990
to the parade on Saturday I think I'm

713
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,570
gonna go I think I'm gonna be crazy

714
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:34,380
enough to do it you know what I bet you

715
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:37,889
every body down there is best friends on

716
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:40,950
Saturday why because we root for the

717
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:44,220
same team it's silly but it's true

718
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:46,800
we like people who are like us all right

719
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:49,470
so we move past this first base you know

720
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:52,139
i these guys like me I'm good all right

721
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:54,059
I've got this executive he he we have

722
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,620
some common points now I need to

723
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:58,379
actually get him to start buying into

724
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:02,040
what I'm trying to to do I need to get

725
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,330
him to ultimately want to move forward

726
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,909
with what I think we need to move

727
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:10,250
forward so our organization can really

728
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:12,870
be better John Maxwell has this quote

729
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:14,670
leaders have two characteristics first

730
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,919
they're going somewhere and second they

731
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:18,750
are able to persuade other people to go

732
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:22,380
with them

733
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:24,120
it's all about persuasion now I told you

734
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,610
I'm going to count manager simple terms

735
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,620
I'm a sales guy and a lot of times I'll

736
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:32,639
tell people you know I'm a sales guy and

737
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:36,419
you know what I'll hear often oh I could

738
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:39,270
never do that no way I could never be in

739
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,920
sales and I always answer why and and I

740
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,750
know the answer why it's because they

741
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:45,390
don't want to be the used car sales guy

742
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:48,179
and why do we always think of the used

743
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:51,549
car sales guy are they really that bad I

744
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:53,799
buy a lot of used cars and I

745
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:55,029
never run into a guy who's really slick

746
00:30:53,799 --> 00:31:00,039
and slimy

747
00:30:55,029 --> 00:31:02,799
at least at the car sales line but we

748
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:05,710
have this picture of what a salesperson

749
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:10,499
is and for some reason we don't trust

750
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:12,580
them but you have to get rid of this

751
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:16,480
because each and every one of us

752
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:18,369
we're in sales I don't care if you're

753
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,110
trying to sell your boss on a raise I

754
00:31:18,369 --> 00:31:22,720
don't care if you're trying to sell an

755
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:24,279
executive on a on a program I don't care

756
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,440
if you're trying to sell your wife on a

757
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:28,899
date I don't care what you're trying to

758
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:33,820
do we are all in sales and we are all

759
00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:36,428
persuading the key to this successful

760
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:39,609
persuasion is representing something you

761
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:41,859
believe in and that's the only way that

762
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:44,830
you will survive this picture here I

763
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:46,928
love it everybody able to see the King

764
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,850
right there and the Kings go in the

765
00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:50,889
battle with this amazing sword because

766
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,259
that's what he knows and you have the

767
00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:56,019
salesman back here who's got the the

768
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:59,320
machine gun they do a lot better in this

769
00:31:56,019 --> 00:32:02,710
battle but what's the King say the words

770
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:07,239
somehow fell out of that I'm too busy

771
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:10,809
tell him I'm too busy but the sales guy

772
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:14,679
guess what he had a better solution a

773
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:16,480
better plan how many believe this firmly

774
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:18,909
if you have a better solution

775
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,210
you really should stand up and let

776
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:25,019
someone know about it would you guys

777
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:28,109
agree with that well that's a persuasion

778
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:30,999
that's sales what's wrong with that

779
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:32,470
there's absolutely nothing wrong with

780
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:34,779
persuading when you believe in something

781
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:36,879
and it'll actually help someone out we

782
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:39,429
all persuade talked about this a moment

783
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:41,350

story and the can't really want to pull

807
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:36,909
out is sales and persuasion is about

808
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,649
sharing what it's right there for you

809
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:42,320
sharing stories I want to tell you

810

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,889
and over and I'm not picking on anyone

812
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,690
but what I've seen is a lot of people

813
00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:49,699
telling a lot of facts I've seen a lot

814
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:52,340
of speakers presenting facts facts facts

815
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,019
facts facts and very few stories and

816
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,519
I've been watching and observing and

817
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:57,679
when a speaker does start to tell a

818
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,019
story guess what happens everybody sits

819
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,909
up all sudden they're back engaged in

820
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:03,980
that whole conversation because we lost

821
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:05,690
storage now I don't know how many share

822
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,240
faith with me but I grew up in church

823
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:09,980
and I read the Bible and I'm the you

824
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,209
know everyone may know who Jesus is and

825
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,819
want me to tell you something about

826
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,929
Jesus I'm not getting religious I'm just

827
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:17,329
telling you the fact that he shared his

828
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:21,740
message through stories they call him

829
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:23,540
parable but he used stories stories are

830
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:25,428
what will get your message across so I

831
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:27,168
always encourage everyone if you really

832
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:29,300
want to get the executives buy-in on

833
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:32,089
whatever you're doing find a way to take

834
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,399
that content that is really dry I mean

835
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:37,849
how many executives know anything about

836
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:39,319
cybersecurity and you're sitting there

837
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:40,700
and you're throwing all these facts at

838
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:41,750
them and you know what they're doing

839
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:43,040
they're looking at you with the blank

840
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,060
stare see and I'd like to help but I

841
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,668
don't even know what this guy's talking

842
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:50,149
about but what if you were able to take

843
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:52,489
this story or are these facts and

844
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:55,098
package it in a story that they could

845
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:59,959
relate to something that would help them

846
00:34:55,099 --> 00:35:01,970
oh that's what it means and maybe it's a

847
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,020
little far or you know stretch you know

848
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,819
but you're just trying to create

849
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,700
something that they can relate to and

850
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:10,819
understand share the story and that is

851
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:12,819
two key to the persuasion it's a very

852
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:16,180
simple

853
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:21,000
and what you represent and share a story

854
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:21,000
and then you'll start to get the buy-in

855
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,300
there's a few things that you need to

856
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,529
know and I'm going to have to go through

857
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,090
a quick I see that clock over there

858
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:33,970
there are certain things I talked about

859
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:34,440
inputs equal outputs and dr. Robert cha

860
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:37,540
Dini

861
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:40,570
he wrote a book called influence and

862
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:42,430
persuasion great books and he talks

863
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:44,230
about seven different influence factors

864
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:46,089
and these again are scientific inputs at

865
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:48,640
equal outputs so I'm just going to talk

866
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:49,810
this three of them giving you some ideas

867
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,740
of what you might be able to implement

868
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:55,170
into your life

869
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:58,870
one is the principle of reciprocity a

870
00:35:55,170 --> 00:36:00,910
simple example is this I told you I'm

871
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:03,009
cheap right I have a membership to Sam's

872
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:05,080
got four kids two guys the like the

873
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:09,210
largest budget line in my entire budget

874
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:13,390
is food and so I have to find ways to to

875
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:15,010
curve that and so I go to Sam's Club and

876
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:17,379
I like to go to Sam's Club on Sunday

877
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:19,510
afternoons because they tend to roll out

878
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:21,130
all those sample cards and if I hit

879
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,230
enough sample carts and each one of the

880
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:25,300
kids take something if it's a really

881
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,650
good Sunday I can end up at the store

882
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,180
and I don't even have to go to lunch

883
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,690
because the sample carts took care of

884
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,899
everything

885
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:33,370
now you would say that's crazy why do

886
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,540
they do that in the first place well

887
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:36,880
I'll tell you why they do that in the

888
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:39,430
first place because when the person at

889
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,860
the car actually engages you all of a

890
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:43,419
sudden you eat a little meatball and she

891
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:45,640
engages you and tells you all about the

892
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:48,430
meatballs and guess what you do before

893
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:51,069
you even know it fine and you throw a

894
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:53,350
package of meatballs in your cart you

895
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:56,380
didn't want meat balls but because she

896
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:59,140
gave you something you almost felt like

897
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,680
you were obligated to give something in

898
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:02,680
return

899
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,819
I see three ladies sitting here I don't

900
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,069
know if you all work together if you

901
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:11,680
just became friends to get today but if

902
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:17,680
you bailed you out she's gonna turn to

903
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:18,480
you and say thanks I guys use it to your

904
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,830
advantage

905
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,430
serve anyone ever heard the concept the

906
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:26,120
servant leadership serve others first

907
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:28,279
and when you serve someone

908
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,569
first I know you're saying well should I

909
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,430
do it for that reason probably not

910
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:34,400
served because you want to but guess

911
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:36,620
what when you do serve that person is

912
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,450
always going to remember that and you

913
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:42,020
are always gonna have that favor sitting

914
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:44,779
there when you need it just use it

915
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:47,570
wisely so if you got an executive you're

916
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:49,220
trying to persuade hey find something

917
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:51,860
you can do for them whether it's help

918
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:53,270
them out on a project whether it's just

919
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:56,030
do some research where I don't know what

920
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:58,460
it might be but serve them and before

921
00:37:56,030 --> 00:38:01,250
you know it you got a favor sitting over

922
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:03,230
there when you need them the next one is

923
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:05,030
commitment and consistency what they've

924
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:06,650
learned is when I make a commitment that

925
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:08,660
I have to follow through with my actions

926
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:11,050
to show consistency to what I say I'm

927
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:14,960
going to give you a simple example

928
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:17,510
Boston Bruins st. Louis fans the Boston

929
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,130
Bruins fans said my team's the greatest

930
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:20,990
they're going to destroy the Blues the

931
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,880
st. Louis Blues fan says fine let's bet

932
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:29,779
a hundred bucks the Boston Bruins fan

933
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:33,320
says what he's kind of in a pickle he

934
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:35,210
can say no and now he appears cheap or

935
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,650
he appears that he doesn't actually

936
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:40,010
believe us team's better than the Blues

937
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:42,890
in the first place or the most likely

938
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:44,870
scenario is because he just said the

939
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:48,879
Bruins are better than the Blues it came

940
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:51,890
out of his mouth and he verbally smade a

941
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:55,730
commitment when I turn and say how about

942
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:58,220
$100 bet he almost has to accept that

943
00:38:55,730 --> 00:39:01,580
bet to be consistent with what just came

944
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:03,470
out of his mouth turning this to

945
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:06,380
business some of the best things you can

946
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:08,930
do is again and asking the questions try

947
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:10,850
to lead with some questions and get that

948
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,649
executive friend that you've just made

949
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:15,080
that you're trying to get on your team

950
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,280
ask some questions about what are your

951
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,740
thoughts on cybersecurity

952
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,030
you know where are we at risk and what

953
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:22,490
would happen what do you think would

954
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:24,410
happen if so-and-so and make up some

955
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:25,759
other company if they got hacked you

956
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:27,109
know what would this do to their

957
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,400
business oh man that would cost them

958
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:29,300
millions it'd probably be sued and

959
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,460
they'd be out of business

960
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,540
oh yeah and you'll II don't see where

961
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:35,240
I'm doing and kind of lead them and all

962
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:38,029
of a sudden they make this commitment of

963
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,290
cybersecurity is important now I'm not

964
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,960
saying you jump on them right then and

965
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:42,000
there

966
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,340
but they remember they did that so when

967
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,640
you need to go back you remember when

968
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:50,310
you said that they kind of have to

969
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:53,670
follow through some action to support

970
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:55,830
what they had already said another one

971
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:57,890
is Authority and social proof why do you

972
00:39:55,830 --> 00:40:01,620
think they put the celebrities and

973
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:02,970
advertisements on TV it's simply social

974
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:05,370
proof it's no more than peer pressure

975
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:08,189
when an authority says something we do

976
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:09,660
it I don't know who your hero is here in

977
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:12,270
this building maybe you have some heroes

978
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,950
people you've been following but a lot

979
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:15,750
of times if they were on stage and they

980
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:17,370
get up here and you love them and you

981
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:19,350
believe them and they said you need to

982
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:21,600
use this platform because this platform

983
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:24,390
does X Y & Z and they just really

984
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:26,850
believe it and you trust them and and

985
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:29,190
you believe in who they are and you

986
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:31,170
really respect their knowledge and you

987
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:34,020
need a similar system what system are

988
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:36,300
you gonna buy probably the same exact

989
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:38,580
one he just told you you should buy it

990
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,870
just comes down to social proof use it

991
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,819
to your advantage if you see an article

992
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,710
come out and it supports what you're

993
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,750
trying to accomplish email it to the

994
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:47,160
person now again remember don't email it

995
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:48,720
to a stranger you've already made

996
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,190
friends with them remember you're

997
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,899
emailing it to a friend and said hey I

998
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,760
thought you would like this I thought

999
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:58,680
this would be useful for you I want to

1000
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:00,090
just kind of help it along after you've

1001
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,830
started persuading and you got these

1002
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:03,900
guys on your team you've effectively put

1003
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:05,490
this human being in your node I need you

1004
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:09,320
to remember something it's important to

1005
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:12,479
keep this relationship for the long term

1006
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:14,070
do not let relationships go this is

1007
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,870
where relationship management comes in

1008
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:18,390
I'm going to tell you something ready

1009
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:20,190
this might be one the key components for

1010
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:23,609
any leader in here the most expensive

1011
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:25,980
thing and life and business is losing a

1012
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:31,530
relationship in your node anyone in this

1013
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:33,860
room ever been divorced expensive yes

1014
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:37,200
and whenever lost a good employee

1015
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:40,770
expensive anyone ever lost a good

1016
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:43,080
customer oh you guys are good I've lost

1017
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:45,390
customers before too it's expensive

1018
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:48,480
and the key point I'm really trying to

1019
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:50,490
make is we have to maintain these

1020
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,830
relationships and we need to keep them

1021
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:53,939
for the long term so how do we do it

1022
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:55,830
well other simple things I'm going to

1023
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,030
some relationship books on you now we

1024
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:58,470
need to mind the emotional bank account

1025
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:00,540
how many of us would a bank account this

1026
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:02,459
we know that you can deposit money in

1027
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,690
the bank account right and you deposit

1028
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,950
money in the bank account so when you

1029
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:09,210
need it you can pull it back out correct

1030
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:11,970
emotional bank accounts are simply this

1031
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:14,340
we go back to the servant thing if I

1032
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:16,350
take care of the needs of a person I'm

1033
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:18,300
trying to build that relationship and

1034
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:21,150
keep a relationship with if I make

1035
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:24,450
emotional deposits in that account when

1036
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:28,920
I actually need something back I will

1037
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:31,740
have already stored favors I will have

1038
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,870
stored help I will have stored all kinds

1039
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,950
of things there for me to pull out when

1040
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:37,319
I need it

1041
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:39,509
the key factor is make sure you do a lot

1042
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:43,140
of deposits first before you ever try to

1043
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:44,040
pull any out say how can I do that well

1044
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,509
there's a book out there it's a

1045
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:50,180
relationship book called the five love

1046
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:52,920
languages and it's really geared toward

1047
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,720
marital relationships quite frankly but

1048
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,730
I believe it aligns with business too

1049
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,350
because each one of us the theory of the

1050
00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:00,870
book is each one of us have a primary

1051
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:02,850
love language that excites us and when

1052
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:06,000
someone does this to us we actually feel

1053
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:07,440
the emotion of love each one of us in

1054
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,810
this room may have a different one on

1055
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,460
there and they are gifts acts of

1056
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:14,220
kindness quality time words of

1057
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:17,400
affirmation and touch I'm going to go

1058
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:18,959
through each one in business gifts guys

1059
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,240
this could be as simple as company swag

1060
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,180
this could be as simple as knowing that

1061
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,649
someone likes the blues and you were

1062
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,720
there buying a t-shirt and you just

1063
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:30,210
bought an extra t-shirt I'm not talking

1064
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:33,270
about large gifts I'm talking about just

1065
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:36,240
basic small stuff to say hey I know you

1066
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:37,560
I thought of you I care about you now

1067
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,819
you only do this if you know they like

1068
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,870
gifts you kind of got to get to know

1069
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,520
them you know you'll be able to find

1070
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:44,490
what they like but if it's someone you

1071
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,690
think likes when they get stuff man just

1072
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:47,160
always show up with

1073
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:51,150
something I heard a story the other day

1074
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:54,060
of oh my gosh this his name is a the

1075
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:55,920
greatest investor of all time Buffett

1076
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:57,330
Buffett I heard a story the other day of

1077
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,860
Warren Buffett when someone actually

1078
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:00,330
went to visit him and they said you get

1079
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,650
10 minutes and they measured this ten

1080
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:02,910
minutes two minutes and they did a

1081
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:04,230
little research and realized he like

1082
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,910
cherry coke and they showed up with the

1083
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:07,620
cherry coke and you know what he said to

1084
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,009
them you can have as much time as you

1085
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,420
want

1086
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:11,340
no one ever brings me with my favorite

1087
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,720
drink the simple fact that bringing a

1088
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:15,120
favorite drink opened up ten minutes

1089
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,549
into what ended up being an hour and a

1090
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,990
half conversation so gifts a lot of

1091
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:20,640
times well actually if that's your love

1092
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,189
language is going to open them up to you

1093
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,720
and continue to build that relationship

1094
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:26,490
acts of kindness again this comes down

1095
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,620
the servanthood this may just be helping

1096
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:30,390
someone when they need help but these

1097
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:32,279
random acts of kindness or maybe they're

1098
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:34,529
not so random but these helps to each

1099
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,390
other sell someone I care about you and

1100
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:38,790
in turn is filling that emotional bank

1101
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:41,790
account quality time

1102
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:43,440
that is what it is maybe you just go to

1103
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:45,390
lunch with someone maybe you meet them

1104
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,190
for coffee every now and then maybe your

1105
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:48,990
family's actually hangout I don't know

1106
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:50,850
what that looks like but what I'm saying

1107
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:52,770
is some people just like spending time

1108
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:54,060
with others and if that's the person

1109
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:56,190
you're trying to build the relationship

1110
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:58,259
and maintain the relationship with just

1111
00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:00,660
spend some time with them and fill the

1112
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:02,490
emotional bank account words of

1113
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:06,810
affirmation how many like being told

1114
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:08,279
you're a great person I like it if

1115
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:10,620
that's your person tell them they're

1116
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,390
doing a good job just everyone in hey

1117
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:14,940
man that was a great work oh man

1118
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:17,069
whatever you did on that fantastic

1119
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:19,080
and you make them feel good and you

1120
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:20,460
filled the emotional bank account this

1121
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,200
one's a little more touchy okay the

1122
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,520
whole touch one because in really in the

1123
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,169
business and work spot we can't do the

1124
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,530
physical touch that's a dangerous aspect

1125
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:30,360
to do so what I mean by physical touch

1126
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:32,640
or actually not even physical touch what

1127
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,800
I mean by touch are the simple factors

1128
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,230
of just again I'm thinking of you maybe

1129
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,630
it's a quick text hey I saw this thought

1130
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:42,840
you might like it it's the simple quick

1131
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:44,640
hit in essence they're little touches to

1132
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:47,280
say I was thinking of you and in those

1133
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:49,799
touches you are building your emotional

1134
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,570
and as you build that emotional bank

1135
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,550
account guess what when you need their

1136
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:55,080
help when you need their buy-in you've

1137
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:58,080

1139
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,520

1140
