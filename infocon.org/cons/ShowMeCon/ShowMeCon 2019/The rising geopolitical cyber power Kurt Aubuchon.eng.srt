1
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,370
all right

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,678
this next guy is a professor of cyber

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,830
security at the University of Mary Ville

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:35,969
and he's a principal consultant at pour

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:38,218
Tunis consulting Kurt ah bhishan okay I

6
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,079
guess how's this gonna stay there hey

7
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,030
welcome everybody thanks for coming to

8
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,899
my talk

9
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:48,329
aha there we go yeah so thanks very much

10
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,550
for coming to my talk my name is Kurt

11
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,879
Aubuchon and I do a couple different

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,750
things

13
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,670
I have a computer forensics and Incident

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,829
Response consulting service called port

15
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,660
Tunis consulting and has been tuned I'm

16
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,239
also an assistant professor of cyber

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,649
security at Maryville University and

18
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,210
there's a little bit about me and all my

19
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,340
alphabet soup and all that kind of fun

20
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,570
stuff

21
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,770
so this talk might be a little bit

22
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,229
different than some of them that you

23
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,490
have here at Xiaomi Con this year and by

24
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,700
the way can you guys in the back hear me

25
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,979
okay cool

26
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:23,759
so this talk was kind of inspired by and

27
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:25,860
in response to a paper that can I went

28
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,200
around the International Relations and

29
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,799
foreign policy community by a guy named

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,200
Richard hundra's Richard Andrews was one

31
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,939
of the national security advisors to a

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,970
couple different presidents including

33
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:41,520
president george w bush and earlier this

34
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,890
year andrás published a paper in a

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,579
couple of foreign policy journals called

36
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:51,840
cyber conflict and geopolitics and I

37
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:54,389
said andrás is a longtime and national

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:02:00,540
security and military guy and I'm going

39
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:01,649
to tell you why he's wrong so or at

40
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,430
least why I think he came is this a

41
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:07,860
little bit of move what is going on

42
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,509
so Andres talks about that he starts his

43
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,430
paper talking about great and

44
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,779
geopolitical shifts

45
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:20,069
and he outlines a couple of different

46
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:21,720
times when in his view one country sort

47
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:24,208
of was the out in the route in front of

48
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,799
a new technology in one country was

49
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:28,109
really in the forefront of developing

50
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:29,819
some new technology and in that country

51
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:34,200
was ultimately threatened Great

52
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:36,929
Britain's global hegemony so there's all

53
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,078
kind of my summary of what on dresses

54
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,450
argument is it's a Richard undress goes

55
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:45,209
on to say that he thinks that we were

56
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:48,089
seeing a third great geopolitical shift

57
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:50,489
in this time in cyberspace his argument

58
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,139
is that the United States led the

59
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:53,970
development of Internet technology and

60
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,189
communication technology and so on and

61
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,590
he believes that we're in danger of

62
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:00,720
being eclipsed by other powers that are

63
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,060
going to sort of embrace that technology

64
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,180
and do it better than us so he says we

65
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,980
should sort of heed the warnings of

66
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:13,319
Spain in the 16th century and Great

67
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:17,488
Britain in the 18th century so hundreds

68
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:20,629
parks and resorts to three main areas of

69
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:23,489
concern he talks about active measures

70
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:25,620
influence operations and economic

71
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,569
attacks talking to talk a little bit

72
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,859
about what undresses argument is in each

73
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:31,548
of these and I'll kind of add some

74
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:33,900
context and some of where I think Andres

75
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:36,870
is actually right in many of these areas

76
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:43,079
now I've had some context around his

77
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:45,000
argument so first uh Andres talks about

78
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:48,349
excuse me

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,310
first Andres talks about active measures

80
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:53,608
and with active measures what he's

81
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:57,599
talking about our ways and our incidents

82
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:58,739
when one adversary interferes with the

83
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,369
other adversaries critical

84
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:04,620
infrastructure and so on now as many of

85
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,040
you guys and if you all in this room are

86
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:11,040
I'm sure aware Stuxnet in 2010 kind of

87
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,728
ushered in the age of cyber warfare now

88
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,780
although it's never been like officially

89
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:19,669
admitted pretty much everyone knows that

90
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,470
the US and Israel work together to

91
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:24,620
unleash stuck

92
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:28,310
in an effort to disrupt processing at an

93
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,680
Iranian nuclear power plant our nuclear

94
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,900
enrichment facility rather so this was

95
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,460
sort of the first time that a cyber

96
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,900
weapon was used in an active measures

97
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,580
campaign at least that we are aware of

98
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,960
[Music]

99
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,130
that was pretty cool about Stuxnet again

100
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,159
as many of you in this room probably

101
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:49,010
know is that Stuxnet subtly altered the

102
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,470
programmable logic controllers managing

103
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:54,469
the centrifuges at these enrichment

104
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:56,390
facilities now I'm not a non-nuclear

105
00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:00,820
scientist of course but as I understand

106
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:04,190
it enriching uranium is a very precise

107
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,780
process and if your centrifuges spin

108
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,820
just a little too fast you look too slow

109
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,590
you don't get things that go boom at the

110
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,909
end right you don't get into uranium

111
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:15,710
that you want so Stuxnet kind of fiddled

112
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,570
with the PLC's programmable logic

113
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,250
controllers so that the centrifuges

114
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,900
would not spin at the correct crate but

115
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,970
the sea but the PLC would continue to

116
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:26,479
tell the operator that it was spinning

117
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,800
at the right rate so the guy managing

118
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,020
the system would see oh it's spinning

119
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,180
yet whatever 7,000 rpms or something

120
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,000
like normal but we're not getting things

121
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:39,070
that go boom something is wrong and so

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:48,919
that put the nuclear iran's nuclear

123
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:51,560
project back a few years now I'm sort of

124
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:56,060
trying to be objective and sort of not

125
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,620
take sides on this that is sort of good

126
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,080
as far as it goes right but I think it's

127
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,630
relatively easy to imagine that the US

128
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,050
and Israel could have set the

129
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:07,790
centrifuges to go into a unsafe state

130
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,650
they could have made such a futures blow

131
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:13,729
apart their cause damage to the machines

132
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:19,390
or injure or kill the operators standing

133
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:21,740
next to them and so the Stuxnet it was I

134
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:24,110
guess sort of notable not only for the

135
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,990
new technology but for the kinds of

136
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,960
attacks that it sort of hinted at or

137
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,340
sort of foreshadowed and you know I say

138
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,690
don't take sides I'm obviously I'm a

139
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,138
patriotic American and so on but I just

140
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:37,810
want to stick to sort of the you know

141
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:40,990
someone objective and and you know

142
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,240
technical aspects of this okay

143
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,889
so then in 2015 things started to get a

144
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,840
little more interesting when Russia

145
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:51,129
compromised some power plants in Ukraine

146
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,479
compromised the distribution system you

147
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:54,729
Russia and Ukraine were fighting at the

148
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,979
time and Russia compromised Ukrainian

149
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:58,359
power distribution system and cut off

150
00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:03,068
power to about two hundred thousand

151
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,659
people in Kiev and in 2016 or a year

152
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:12,069
later Russia did the same thing again

153
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:12,699
again as part of their conflict in 2017

154
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:14,860
fireEye

155
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:17,949
released some research on a group they

156
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:21,550
called triton which they didn't if i

157
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:24,969
right did not identify the target

158
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,740
country but they talked about how the

159
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:31,060
triton threat actor I think probably

160
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:33,669
presumed to be perhaps Russia tampered

161
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,509
with the safety systems on some of these

162
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:39,068
industrial control systems so I

163
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:41,800
mentioned earlier that you can imagine

164
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:43,509
that if US and Israel had wanted to blow

165
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,759
up the Natanz plant they could have done

166
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:47,740
it well that's probably true but these

167
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,569
industrial control systems have a you

168
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:53,409
know a safety system that's separate and

169
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:54,969
apart from the PLC what Triton did for

170
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:57,789
the first time that we know of is it

171
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:59,379
tampered with those safety systems so

172
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:01,870
that they could get an unsafe condition

173
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:03,939
and the safety systems would not stop it

174
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,529
right so they were able to override to

175
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:08,649
sort of this the brakes on the system

176
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:11,800
override the safety controls so this is

177
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:13,839
again have another escalation in the

178
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:19,949
cyber attacks being used as part of

179
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:22,270
active measures now in the United States

180
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:23,529
about 90 percent of our critical

181
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:27,580
infrastructure which is things like

182
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:29,680
power plants and dams and water

183
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,270
treatment facilities and sewer and all

184
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,810
that kind of stuff ninety percent of

185
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:36,909
that is in private hands or private

186
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:39,218
companies so we have this sort of

187
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:41,559
hodgepodge of private companies managing

188
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:44,199
our security infrastructure security

189
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:46,479
measures very widely and there's very

190
00:08:44,198 --> 00:08:47,120
little coordination among these

191
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,300
companies

192
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,010
[Music]

193
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:55,250
so for example I just kind of when I you

194
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:57,319
know googled PLC to get a sort of stock

195
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:01,220
image of a PLC controller I got this

196
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,320
person here on the left just kind of by

197
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:07,130
happenstance who is operating a water

198
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,450
control system in freer Texas so you can

199
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:11,270
see this person here it's got a PLC

200
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:13,520
basically it's a plain old PC with which

201
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,990
she is managing the water control system

202
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,730
I don't know what that is but it looks

203
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,580
like some sort of mix of chemicals or

204
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,010
whatever so that's just a plain old PC

205
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,710
right how easy do you think it is to

206
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:27,140
compromise that plain old PC and do some

207
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:30,220
sort of unauthorized change or some sort

208
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:32,930
of damage to the water control system I

209
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:36,820
was kind of interested in well what is

210
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:39,140
freer Texas and what is their water

211
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,630
company like is it's like a really big

212
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:44,270
sort of mature company that's we think

213
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:47,540
is doing security well that's the water

214
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:50,900
company in freer Texas that's it that's

215
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,790
all company right there their online

216
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,079
presence it's a Facebook page and then

217
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:59,449
some third-party companies that they

218
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:01,850
contracted for Bill collection so these

219
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,290
these people I mean I'm not trying to

220
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,890
sort of lock as I am trying to sort of

221
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:08,839
mock them but you know they're probably

222
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:10,460
civil engineers and there's probably

223
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,260
some sort of like accounting customer

224
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,450
service people all right they're not

225
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:18,200
security people and from the looks of it

226
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:21,170
they're probably kind of operating maybe

227
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,730
on the slim budget and they probably

228
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:26,540
don't really have a whole lot of

229
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:31,310
resources to protect their security so

230
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:33,650
in sort of this active measures right if

231
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:36,770
we get into a fight with another country

232
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,660
and they want to use cyber attacks as an

233
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,800
active measure these are probably the

234
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:43,010
kind of targets that they're going to go

235
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,109
after because they can go in and as

236
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:48,890
we've seen when Stuxnet and Triton and

237
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:51,140
all these other attacks everyone now

238
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:53,680
who's into that sort of thing knows how

239
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,699
to fiddle with these things effectively

240
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:00,189
so that the operator doesn't know what's

241
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:02,680
going on and hey presto you've just put

242
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,449
too much chlorine in the water or you've

243
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,920
just mixed two chemicals and caused an

244
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:13,180
uncontrolled reaction or something like

245
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:14,949
that so that's Andres talks about these

246
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:19,899
sorts of things and yet kind of added a

247
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:23,170
few examples just to to be frightening I

248
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:27,790
guess I think Sandra's is right about

249
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:30,040
that that cyber operations are going to

250
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:33,939
be more and more a part of active

251
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,110
measure or active measures done through

252
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:36,519
cyber operations they're going to be

253
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,130
more and more a part of any conflict

254
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,970
that we find ourselves in going forward

255
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:45,009
[Music]

256
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:49,540
the next hundred talks about influence

257
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:51,490
campaigns and of course the big example

258
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:54,040
of this is in the run up to the 2016

259
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:56,319
presidential election Russia carried out

260
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,319
this big multifaceted influence campaign

261
00:11:56,319 --> 00:12:01,329
to sort of undermine confidence in US

262
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:08,670
elections and undermine confidence in US

263
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:08,670
institutions and they did this through

264
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,839
basically propaganda on Facebook and

265
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:16,508
Twitter and social media and so on and

266
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,269
also through hacking the democratic

267
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:22,060
organizations and releasing documents on

268
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:26,560
blogs through this online persona of

269
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:31,050
Kucha for 2.0 as it carried out by the

270
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:34,750
FSB and the GRU the FSB is kind of

271
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,349
analogous to our CIA or FBI kind of a

272
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,810
hybrid of the two

273
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,209
and the GRU is Russian military

274
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:43,119
intelligence the GRU is actually the one

275
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:44,559
who did the most damage they were the

276
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,680
ones who actually got into John Podesta

277
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:50,380
Z mail and got into the DNC and things

278
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:55,149
like that and that online persona

279
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:59,920
lucifer 2.0 Wow was traced back to a GRU

280
00:12:55,149 --> 00:13:01,420
unit and they also did the social media

281
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:07,029
propaganda efforts to run by this group

282
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:09,399
called the internet research agency and

283
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:12,250
you know these so this was I think

284
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,840
showing how you know it's relatively

285
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,760
easy to carry out

286
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,050
luhan's campaign on social media you

287
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,540
know over the past couple of days you

288
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:21,640
guys have probably been seeing a few

289
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:25,110
articles about deep fakes and how

290
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:27,550
they're getting really good at faking

291
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:31,330
people talking right are doing fake

292
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,660
videos so the dai is getting a lot

293
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,690
better

294
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,819
and it's relatively easy now to take a

295
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,020
famous person and manipulate the video

296
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,900
so it appears they're saying something

297
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:43,300
that are really not there's a video of

298
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,640
Mark Zuckerberg going around on Facebook

299
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:48,339
now where they have Zuckerberg saying

300
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:53,110
all kinds of crazy things which is just

301
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:55,090
it just fake right and there's a website

302
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,580
called this person does not exist I

303
00:13:55,090 --> 00:14:00,970
think we can go you can get sort of an

304
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:03,130
AI generated face that it looks pretty

305
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:06,100
real but it's just a completely you know

306
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:08,980
a completely random but realistic

307
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,870
looking face so those are good for

308
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,790
things like fake social media profiles

309
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,620
it used to be that if you want to set up

310
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,760
a fake social media profile you had to

311
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,350
go out and get a stock image or

312
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,880
something right and you need to just do

313
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,590
a reverse google image search and find

314
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,570
out where the stock image came from they

315
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,290
can't do that anymore because you can go

316
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:27,700
to this person does not exist get a fake

317
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,500
picture of a person that looks very real

318
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,870
and Google refers image you will never

319
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:35,890
find it because it's not an image

320
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:40,080
anyplace right so anyways andres talks a

321
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:43,949
lot about influencer campaigns using

322
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,870
internet and social media and so on

323
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:49,090
Russia after the DNR around shortly

324
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,920
after the DNC acts in the election

325
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,360
interference Russia carried out some

326
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,060
similar campaigns against the world

327
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,580
anti-doping agency in retaliation for

328
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:06,160
some Russian athletes being banned for

329
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:08,110
doping so the third sort of main area of

330
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,770
concern that Andres talks about and

331
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:16,180
again where I think he's right is

332

334
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,929
now in the 20th century about 80% of

335
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,079
corporate wealth was intangible things

336
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:30,439
like inventory right it was in stuff

337
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:33,229
finished goods machines materials the

338
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:34,459
21st century 8% of corporate wealth is

339
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:38,660
an intellectual property and trade

340
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:40,160
secrets I used to work for a

341
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,860
manufacturing company here in st. Louis

342
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:47,059
they made big machines that did Auto

343
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:48,949
Service so like you enroll into the shop

344
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:50,689
and you did the lifts lifts up your car

345
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:52,368
and I work for a company that made those

346
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:54,829
kinds of things and brake lathes and

347
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:56,899
whatever the technical Avada convinced

348
00:15:54,829 --> 00:16:00,049
them that no one's going to come in and

349
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:02,360
steal a lift from your factory right

350
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:04,040
your threat is people stealing the

351
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,989
source code that runs those things right

352
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,439
or stealing the R&D for the next

353
00:16:05,989 --> 00:16:12,939
generation of lifts all the value of the

354
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:12,939
company now is an intellectual property

355
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,189
so of course we're all worried about

356
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:21,829
criminals stealing from companies but

357
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:23,360
nation-states are big thefts of our big

358
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:28,779
thieves of intellectual property and

359
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:31,009
trade secret as well you all may have

360
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:33,740
may remember this from a year or two ago

361
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:35,839
where by abusing the border gateway

362
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,119
protocol a bunch of internet traffic was

363
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,059
for reasons no one has ever sufficiently

364
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:42,889
explained was routed through China right

365
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:45,259
and so instead of you know if you're

366
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:46,759
trying to send Internet traffic from New

367
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:48,279
York to London for some strange reason

368
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:53,540
it would go through China like wow

369
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:55,189
that's odd and it has not been proven

370
00:16:53,540 --> 00:17:00,169
but it appears to be that China was able

371
00:16:55,189 --> 00:17:08,000
to abuse the BGP to perhaps sniff a

372
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:09,849
bunch of Internet traffic and it's

373
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,409
really China's really pretty open about

374
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:14,658
stealing trade secrets right it's just

375
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:15,940
um you know Charlie pretty much an open

376
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:19,039
secret but that's what they're doing

377
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,039
[Music]

378
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:34,090
excuse me okay sorry about that all

379
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,370
right so these are all things that

380
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:39,668
Montez talks about I think he's really

381
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:41,229
right about all these things he as you

382
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:43,749
know I think and again not a surprise

383
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,460
probably do many of you hear that cyber

384
00:17:43,749 --> 00:17:48,159
operations are going to increasingly be

385
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:50,230
a part of any conflict that we're in if

386
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:52,269
we're in you know three people called a

387
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:54,249
kinetic conflict right kinetic attack is

388
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:55,389
when things go boom right is when you

389
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:57,190
shoot something or drop bombs on

390
00:17:55,389 --> 00:17:58,719
something so I think cyber attacks are

391
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,460
going to increasingly be a part of any

392
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,119
kinetic conflict that we find ourselves

393
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:06,249
in influence operations and using the

394
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:08,049
tools of mass communication for

395
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:10,419
propaganda that's always been with us

396
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:12,639
right we've always engaged in propaganda

397
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:15,240
efforts against other countries and they

398
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:22,119
against us but it's going to get easier

399
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:23,830
and sort of more effective and economic

400
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:27,730
disruption is going to continue to be a

401
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:30,100
big part of cyber operations so the

402
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,860
challenges for us as defenders well one

403
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,639
we have the open nature of the Internet

404
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,269
right the internet wasn't really

405
00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:38,799
intended to be sort of our main

406
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:39,850
communication method and you know the

407
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,190
way about which we all get through our

408
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:45,340
lives and so it's you know the open and

409
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,720
sort of you know fluid nature of the

410
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:50,740
Internet makes it difficult for us as

411
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,289
defenders to defend our stuff lack

412
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:56,019
coordination among targeted enterprises

413
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:57,309
so get back to the fact that about 90%

414
00:18:56,019 --> 00:19:00,159
of our critical infrastructures and

415
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:01,809
private hands many of them don't really

416
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:04,509
communicate with each other now you have

417
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:06,039
efforts like InfraGard and so on that

418
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:10,090
are trying to get people to talk to each

419
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:11,200
other and those are sort of helpful but

420
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,959
and you know not necessarily

421
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,419
comprehensive in fact there's actually

422
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,830
an incentive or there are incentives for

423
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:19,840
secrecy when companies get attacked

424
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,820
right the incentive is for them not to

425
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:28,959
tell anybody because we don't to be

426
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:31,629
embarrassed so if there were a you know

427
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,820
active measures campaign in cyberspace

428
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,330
against the US I think we'd be a real

429
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,939
dissipate

430
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:40,689
because you could knock down the water

431
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:43,120
treatment plant in freer Texas and it

432
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,890
would be I think very difficult for

433
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,090
other water treatment plants to know

434
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,860
that it had happened to know what

435
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:50,649
happened to know how to defend against

436
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:53,409
it not only because for your Texas

437
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:56,680
probably doesn't have you know really

438
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:58,450
highly skilled ins in response people at

439
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,460
the ready but also because even if they

440
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,960
did they're in did their incentives and

441
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:07,570
their instinct would be to keep it quiet

442
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:10,240
right plus I have a low supply of

443
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:12,129
skilled security practitioners that's

444
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,420
great for me as a professor because it's

445
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,940
easier for me to help my students find

446
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:18,070
jobs right but not so good for the

447
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,230
people who are trying to protect their

448
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:25,240
stuff because it's difficult to find

449
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:26,710
enough good people to protect yourself

450
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,210
against people like the Russians our

451
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:31,710
nation a highly resourced and highly

452
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,710
skilled nation-state attackers a

453
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,860
difficulty of attribution even when

454
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,870
something does get hacked is always

455
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:42,070
difficult to know who really did it

456
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:43,389
I think lots of times companies if they

457
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,129
don't really know they just say it was

458
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,510
probably North Korea or China or all the

459
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,820
way of course it's North Korea yeah

460
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:51,100
those guys again right

461
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:54,220
but really it's difficult to attribute

462
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:59,530
attacks sometimes they get pretty close

463
00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:00,970
but it's really even if we sort of you

464
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,920
know even if we're talking to each other

465
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,630
even if everyone is sort of more upfront

466
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,820
about the fact that they were attacked

467
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,770
it's difficult for us to know who did it

468
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,330
who do we blame for it and if we're in

469
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:14,050
active measures campaign who do we

470
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:15,340
retaliate against this is kind of

471
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:20,830
interesting though anecdotes I have a

472
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:23,320
couple of minutes in the DNC attack so

473
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:26,020
you may remember that there was this

474
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,700
online persona named Gucci 42.0 who

475
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:30,220
gathered all these documents for the DNC

476
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:33,010
and John Podesta Z mail and so on and it

477
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:36,250
posted them online right couch ever had

478
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:37,600
this WordPress site where they would

479
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,670
post these documents and they would go

480
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,830
on Twitter and say hey go look at theirs

481
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,160
the most recent dump of so-and-so his

482
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:48,320
emails

483
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:51,680
so the crucifer 2.0 people we served

484
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:55,610
more than one used a VPN called elite

485
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:57,440
VPN that was an anonymizing VPN right so

486
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:59,030
whenever they would go on Twitter or log

487
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,710
into their work press account they would

488
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:03,770
go through this elite VPN and so you

489
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:05,110
knew it was hard to know where they were

490
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,400
coming from

491
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:09,409
except that one time when they didn't

492
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,320
right when whoever was logging into

493
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:16,130
Twitter messed up forgot to use elite

494
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:20,570
VPN and logged in from their desk which

495
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:23,390
was in the GRU headquarters in Moscow so

496
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:27,290
when the this was in some of the the

497
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:28,340
robert muller indictment reports so they

498
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:30,530
talked about how there's at least one

499
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,179
time when they left their real IP

500
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:35,360
address in the log so if I think Twitter

501
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:38,420
or WordPress so sometimes it's easy to

502
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,889
tribute attacks right but generally if

503
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:44,570
the attackers are a little more

504
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:47,800
consistent than that and of course the

505
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:47,800
enormous complexity of networks

506
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,450
information security guy you know I sort

507
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,220
of like everyone else I point and laugh

508
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:58,460
at companies that get hacked that didn't

509
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,320
do a good job but really deep down in my

510
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,910
heart of hearts I know that is kind of

511
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,620
impossible to protect a modern company

512
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,790
from getting breached if your attacker

513
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:08,389
really wants to get in and they're gonna

514
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:10,700
get in aren't they because our networks

515
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:12,830
are enormously complex we have you know

516
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:16,580
everyone has their own devices everyone

517
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:17,629
wants to work remotely right and so if

518
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,520
the bad guys want to get in they're

519
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,870
gonna get in so that it can puts us at a

520
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,350
disadvantage especially if we're talking

521
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:25,340
about some sort of active measures thing

522
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:28,129
you guys have all heard this cliche

523
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:30,080
right it's a good guys have free ride

524
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:34,040
all the time the bad guys only have to

525
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,810
be lucky once a couple examples of that

526
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:39,139
in 2017

527
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:43,129
Equifax compromised one of my good

528
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:44,810
friends is dr was the one of the

529
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:48,530
directors of the information part of the

530
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:50,060
incident response team at Equifax and

531
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:51,770
I'm pretty sure that what happened was

532
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,330
out of the thousands of servers that

533
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:55,980
Equifax has facing the Internet

534
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:58,949
they missed a patch on two of them

535
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,809
right so I'm not trying to excuse

536
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:02,669
Equifax I think my show done better and

537
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:03,928
there's sort of this you know comedy of

538
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:06,990
errors that led to them missing this

539
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:08,400
patch right you know the the CMDB wasn't

540
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:10,740
updated the guy who was supposed to

541
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,179
patch it was on vacation or whatever but

542
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,380
really it's out of the thousands of

543
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:15,540
servers they managed they missed a patch

544
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,890
on to and it led to a couple hundred

545
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:21,178
million people's information being

546
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:24,020
compromised again going back to the GRU

547
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:28,230
attack when they got John Podesta email

548
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:30,960
it was because the security guy at the

549
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:34,350
Hillary Clinton campaign just flat-out

550
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,710
goofed and missed a phishing email my

551
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:39,030
nest I got this phishing email and he

552
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,309
sent it to the security guy saying is

553
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:44,190
this legitimate the security guy said

554
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:45,660
yeah that's legitimate go ahead and

555
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:55,590
Podesta gave his password to the

556
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:57,720
Russians so again it's the the defenders

557
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,490
are at a really distinct disadvantage

558
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,590
right so if we're talking about things

559
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:04,700
like active measures or economic

560
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:07,049
interruption or interference and so on

561
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,910
we in the US are probably at a

562
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:12,740
disadvantage because of our highly

563
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:16,230
decentralized nature and because of the

564
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:19,049
meeting of the sort of nature sort of

565
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:26,490
the hodgepodge patchwork of our critical

566
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:29,850
infrastructure and so on ok so I think

567
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:32,700
where Richard and rez it kind of gets a

568
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:36,030
little off track here is he thinks that

569
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:38,700
we're in a period that's similar to the

570
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:42,240
you know the shift of naval power and

571
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:45,620
the shift of real power and he I think

572
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,660
paints a picture of a future in which us

573
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:51,239
global hegemony and global dominance in

574
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:52,890
cyberspace is going to be threatened and

575
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,470
there's gonna be some other new cyber

576
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:59,580
power that's gonna basically you know be

577
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:01,620
the dominant cyber power I think he's

578
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:04,139
sort of not quite right about that so

579
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:08,029
there's some differences between today

580
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:10,340
and the past sort of geopolitical shifts

581
00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:13,219
I think make today probably a little

582
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:15,619
scarier so first of all they're very low

583
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:17,419
barriers to entry right so back in the

584
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:19,549
old days the kind of geopolitical shifts

585
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:22,009
that Andres was talking about if you

586
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:24,559
want to become a naval power in the 17th

587
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:27,409
18th century you got to build ships

588
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,119
right you have to follow these ships and

589
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:30,830
you got to you know have all these ports

590
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:33,109
and you got a bill to buy all the

591
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:36,468
cannons and you feed all these sailors

592
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:39,259
right you've become a rail power you

593
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:40,609
have to build a railroad right Russia

594
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:41,869
was a great real power but they had to

595
00:26:40,609 --> 00:26:45,559
build a railroad clear across the

596
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:48,769
country right but what's the barrier to

597
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:51,589
entry to becoming a cyber power there

598
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:56,029
really is none right look at for example

599
00:26:51,589 --> 00:26:57,619
the the Russian influence campaign that

600
00:26:56,029 --> 00:27:01,789
caused so much disruption in the US and

601
00:26:57,619 --> 00:27:03,109
2016 how many people carry that out it

602
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:07,369
was probably a couple dozen guys with

603
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:09,369
laptops right probably just not even

604
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:11,779
very good laptops right because they're

605
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:13,209
how much power how much laptop power

606
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:17,019
does it take just in the fishing email

607
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:19,820
right card to go register for Elite VPN

608
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:23,899
so the low barriers to entry and the low

609
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:25,129
cost of operations I think is a big

610
00:27:23,899 --> 00:27:28,518
difference between now and before I

611
00:27:25,129 --> 00:27:30,949
don't think we're gonna see a period

612
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:32,869
where you know there's gonna be one

613
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:35,119
dominant cyber power that emerges out of

614
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:36,649
the chaos I think we're seeing a period

615
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:39,559
where it's going to be continued chaos

616
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:44,718
with lots of small players who are able

617
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:46,519
to sort of have outsized influence the

618
00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:50,089
conflict that ran now is very

619
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:52,909
asymmetrical look for example at North

620
00:27:50,089 --> 00:27:55,428
Korea North Korea is a pretty prominent

621
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:57,499
and pretty effective player and cyber

622
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:59,179
operations right look what they did to

623
00:27:57,499 --> 00:28:01,839
Sony for instance in retaliation for

624
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:05,149
that and Dobey movie they put out right

625
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,739
the North Korea is a tiny impoverished

626
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:09,678
country but mostly country doesn't have

627
00:28:06,739 --> 00:28:12,129
electricity but they're able to be a

628
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,129
cyber power

629
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:17,850
so I think that what we're the the

630
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,700
period that we're getting into is not

631
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:22,949
that North Korea is going to become the

632
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,990
dominant cyber power or China is going

633
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,850
to become the dominant cyber power I

634
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:28,770
think we're entering into a period where

635
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:31,050
everyone's gonna be sort of sniping at

636
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:32,700
each other all these sort of small

637
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:35,700
players are going to kind of rise and

638
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:40,470
fall in prominence you know maybe for a

639
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:41,880
year you know you know maybe for your

640
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,950
South Africa it's gonna be the dominant

641
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,260
cyber power and then you know at some

642
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:48,390
other point you know it's gonna be you

643
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,010
know Argentina and then because there's

644
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,900
no barrier to entry and as long as you

645
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:54,980
have a couple dozen guys with laptops

646
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:58,350
you can go create all kinds of havoc so

647
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:59,910
I think the notion that we're going to

648
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:02,040
have one dominant cyber power or

649
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:06,180
somewhat outdated I think we're entering

650
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:08,220
a period where whoever or is sort of

651
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:13,160
winning at any given time is can be very

652
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:15,480
fluid also we have the ease of surprise

653
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,310
it's kind of hard to surprise someone

654
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,160
with the fact that you were building a

655
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:21,990
railroad right it's kind of hard to

656
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:26,160
surprise someone with an aircraft

657
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:27,570
carrier anymore pretty easy to surprise

658
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,610
somebody with a DDoS attack though isn't

659
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:31,050
it

660
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:33,929
we're pretty easy to break into freer

661
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:39,120
Texas and poison everyone's water

662
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:41,070
completely by surprise difficulty of

663
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,340
assessing impact this is especially true

664
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:47,070
on the economic side how do you assess

665
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:48,689
the impact if for example China steals a

666
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:51,629
bunch of intellectual property from a

667
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:52,860
major American company it's a major

668
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:55,320
American company probably can't even

669
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:59,520
really assess the impact how do you how

670
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:01,439
do they place a value on their R&D for

671
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,510
the product that they were supposed to

672
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,480
release you know next year year after

673
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:09,330
next and if they can't attribute if they

674
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,880
can't assess the impact and if we can't

675
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:13,980
assess the impact then how do we

676
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:17,400
retaliate for it how do what do we do

677
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:19,440
with well you went and did his economic

678
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,320
impact we're not really sure how bad it

679
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:26,050
was

680
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:28,000
don't do that again you crazy kids again

681
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:30,550
the difficulty of attribution sometimes

682
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,180
we can distribute it but often times we

683
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:36,250
can't the Sony attack everyone pretty

684
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:39,310
sure was North Korea but we're not

685
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:41,020
really sure I mean is if we're going to

686
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:44,830
retaliate against North Korea with a

687
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:46,080
kinetic attack our is pretty good pretty

688
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:48,550
sure is that good enough

689
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,470
Fargo be really sure it was them before

690
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:55,990
we touch off the cruise missiles right

691
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:57,580
which brings me to the last point kind

692
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:01,140
of rolling these all up we have to saw

693
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:04,720
this undefined threshold for retaliation

694
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:06,310
so the United States like last year

695
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,530
Department of Defense issued a white

696
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:11,320
paper saying that we reserve the right

697
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:13,300
to respond to cyber attacks with kinetic

698
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,470
attacks all right so the Department of

699
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:18,669
Defense says if you would have got if

700
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:20,860
you hacked us we might bomb you but

701
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:23,020
what's the threshold for that right how

702
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:25,090
much of a cyber attack are we willing to

703
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:28,660
take before we go out and bomb somebody

704
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:32,379
I don't think anybody really knows that

705
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:35,350
yet and so I think this all again adds

706
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:39,670
up to we're kind of entering this very

707
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:42,520
chaotic political atmosphere where we're

708
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:45,400
all gonna be attacking each other seeing

709
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,360
how much we can get away with we're all

710
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,640
going to be getting increasingly

711
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,560
sophisticated with our active measures

712
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,560
and with our influence campaigns and

713
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:56,350
everything how much can we get away with

714
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:59,290
how sophisticated we can get before

715
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:02,110
someone presses the button right or how

716
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:06,100
sophisticated it can we get how much can

717
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:08,469
we you know if we ddos this company over

718
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:11,199
here are they who are they going to DDoS

719
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:13,570
in return right or if we you know if one

720
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,680
country shuts down the water treatment

721
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:21,159
plant in freer Texas what is our

722
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:23,680
response right is that enough to elicit

723
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:26,010
kinetic response or do we go and try to

724
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,169
hack one of their water plants

725
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:29,580
[Music]

726
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:36,929
so I think we're entering so I think

727
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:39,928
again were where noted national security

728
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:44,130
expert Richard Andres is wrong and I

729
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:45,660
Cornish on cybersecurity I am correct is

730
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,660
that Andres I think is looking at this

731
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,620
from sort of a historical view of

732
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:51,450
someone's going to be the global

733
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:53,100
dominant our and I think what's gonna be

734
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:55,790
the global dominant situation is this is

735
00:32:53,100 --> 00:33:02,129
going to be a long period of chaos and

736
00:32:55,790 --> 00:33:07,379
sort of asymmetrical conflict and recent

737
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:11,929
development just two weeks ago Israel

738
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:14,429
announced that they had taken a

739
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:17,280
cyberattack Israel didn't really say

740
00:33:14,429 --> 00:33:21,030
what it was is a cyber attack that they

741
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:23,790
attributed to Hamas Israel said that

742
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:26,370
they counteracted the attack and then

743
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:28,590
they blew up the building where they

744
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:31,830
believed the Hamas cyber attackers were

745
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:34,139
working from this is believed to be the

746
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:39,418
first time when a country responded to a

747
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:41,429
cyber attack with a kinetic attack and

748
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:43,820
so I think it I think we're all kind of

749
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:46,260
waiting to see how this shakes out right

750
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:51,510
will the international community think

751
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:53,250
that that is proportional or you know

752
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:56,700
are we all gonna kind of think that was

753
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:58,200
overkill right what is it what is a

754
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,650
proportional response to a DDoS attack

755
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:05,760
right or to again a critical

756
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:06,570
infrastructure attack so it was

757
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,389
interesting that this was the first

758
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:10,379
attack I offer no political opinions on

759
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:12,659
whether this is good or bad

760
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:13,710
but we as a gig and kind of as

761
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:16,100
international community we have to

762
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:17,750
decide what is a proportional response

763
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:23,399
[Music]

764
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:25,730
and we just don't know yet okay so I did

765
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:28,409
not go as long as I thought it would go

766
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:32,679
I'll be happy to answer any questions to

767
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:36,169
the extent that I thought I can

768
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:38,810
yeah so you mentioned your card I was

769
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:40,609
there this year at cyber and one of the

770
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,620
things they talked about was many of

771
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:44,380
these major fortune 500 fortune 100

772
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:48,409
companies are actually looking at

773
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:51,770
cybersecurity insurance and if they are

774
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:53,359
breached being compensated for that you

775
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:54,739
know the the amount of time in

776
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,230
remediation that the amount of time

777
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:59,240
potentially in IP loss like talked about

778
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:02,420
but you also talked about the difficulty

779
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:05,470
of assessing damage from a corporate

780
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:09,680
perspective how do you feel the the

781
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:11,359
efficacy of these insurance programs and

782
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,410
frankly their ethical and moral

783
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,540
implications

784
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:16,580
I can't assess how much damage was done

785
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:20,450
how much are these companies going to

786
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:22,009
end up hanging out at all yeah and I

787
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:24,910
don't so the question for those of you

788
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:27,440
may have heard was you know cyber

789
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:28,670
insurance is becoming more common and

790
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,170
sort what the implications of that

791
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,930
especially if you can't and do a good

792
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:35,330
job of assessing the damage and that's

793
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:37,100
another area that I think we're getting

794
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:39,680
closer to a level of maturity in cyber

795
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:41,870
insurance I'm not quite there yet one

796
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,940
company I worked at recently did by

797
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:47,720
cyber insurance it was actually I

798
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:49,250
remember eight or ten years ago in a

799
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,890
previous company I looked at cyber

800
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:54,140
insurance and it was crazy expensive and

801
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:56,390
there was this audit that no way my

802
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:58,100
company could have passed and so it was

803
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,960
just it was a very survival onerous

804
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:02,089
process to get cybersecurity insurance

805
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,790
now the insurance industry has matured a

806
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:06,530
lot now oftentimes there's not even any

807
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,910
audited anymore right in the insurance

808
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,410
company doesn't even bother to come in

809
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:11,660
and check your controls beyond sort of a

810
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:15,980
very cursory look and it's a lot cheaper

811
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:19,730
now so most of the insurance I'm aware

812
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:24,890
of covers things like cost of litigation

813
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:26,930
or cost to go out and hire an incident

814
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:28,339
response personnel they don't really do

815
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:30,830
a very good job of covering the cost

816
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:33,770
like the loss of electoral property @bz

817
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:36,440
and how do you know right so you know

818
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:39,470
let's say a competitor comes in and

819
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:41,329
steals your design for next year's

820
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:43,578
product

821
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:46,400
well your insurance will pay for things

822
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:49,069
like your forensics you're suing them

823
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,569
whatever but I'm not really compensate

824
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:54,220
you for whatever market share you lost

825
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:56,509
right one interesting wrinkle is most

826
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:59,209
cyber insurance policies I'm aware of

827
00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:06,349
will compensate you if you pay the

828
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:08,119
ransom if you get ransom weird so and

829
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,890
that's that count gets to the more

830
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:11,869
that's art the ethical like social good

831
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:14,180
discussion right if you see if you get

832
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:16,940
ransom weird you know the FBI is gonna

833
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:18,470
say don't pay the ransom because number

834
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,240
one you're not sure it's gonna they're

835
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:22,490
gonna get you're gonna get the key but

836
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,939
number two don't feed the beast right

837
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:27,799
don't encourage the bad guys but you

838
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:32,150
know the FBI doesn't have during the

839
00:37:27,799 --> 00:37:35,150
company right there was a last year

840
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:37,460
there was a city government a small city

841
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:40,700
in Texas that was not completely offline

842
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:42,650
by ransom where their emergency services

843
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,848
was down their bus was down everything

844
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:50,059
was down people couldn't pay their bills

845
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:52,069
for weeks and they had insurance to pay

846
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,420
the ransom and they paid the ransom at

847
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:55,520
the FBI told not to but they went and

848
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,980
paid it because the FBI doesn't have to

849
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,259
make sure the bus is run right the FBI

850
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:03,319
isn't manning the 9-1-1 system in this

851
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:06,260
town so it is an ethical problem right

852
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:07,940
because now your insurance company is

853
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,520
making it so there's no real economic

854
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:12,710
disadvantage to paying the ransom right

855
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,210
look you know why not pay the ransom

856
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:18,470
we're paying the insurance company for

857
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:19,400
this and you have an incentive to pay

858
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,290
because you want to get your business

859
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,470
back up but you know that by paying

860
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:30,040
you're just feeding the bad guys right

861
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:33,098
so I don't know sure thank you

862
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,099
[Music]

863
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,579
[Music]

864
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,770
Wow

865
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,960
so for those of you who may not have

866
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:00,880
heard in the back there was a some

867
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,680
companies that got ransom weird they

868
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,360
paid the ransom asked their insurance

869
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,310
company to reimburse them insurance

870
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,210
companies said no because it was an act

871
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:11,799
of war

872
00:39:07,210 --> 00:40:06,520
and traced it back to Russia that's some

873
00:39:11,800 --> 00:40:07,990
very clever yes I I mean I don't have a

874
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:11,110
lot of question is what have we done to

875
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:13,959
sort of prevent a replay of the 2016

876
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:15,900
election interference and to be honest

877
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,820
so much we've done a whole lot you know

878
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:20,710
so the you know the the people who were

879
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:23,650
sort of on the front lines of the

880
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:25,690
Russian election interference for people

881
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:27,430
like the Clinton campaign the Democratic

882
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:30,100
National Committee the Democratic

883
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:33,279
Congressional Campaign Committee so I

884
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:34,569
hope that Democratic organizations have

885
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,000
sort of learned their lesson and gotten

886
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:39,820
better but I don't know right there a

887
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,710
lot of them are you know they're a lot

888
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:45,010
of them are sort of largely volunteer

889
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:46,840
run you know they're they're going to be

890
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:48,310
spending as much money as they can on

891
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,080
campaigns how much money they can spend

892
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:52,170
on security

893
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,170
[Music]

894
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:09,140
that's unclear that is unclear to me

895
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:12,599
yeah yeah it's unclear to me right um

896
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:14,368
because again you the government it

897
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:16,800
might you know the feds might be able to

898
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:20,780
do things like protect federal agencies

899
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,950
right but they can't really force the

900
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:27,690
you know Democratic National Committee

901
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:33,750
to do better they because we have yeah

902
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:35,760
yeah they were they were yeah right

903
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:38,250
and you mentioned voting right who runs

904
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,390
our voting system in the u.s. counties

905
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:44,599
right there's how many counties are

906
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:44,598
there you in the US a gazillion right so

907
00:41:46,580 --> 00:42:00,480
so I'm not doing so I want to avoid

908
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:03,570
getting into a political discussion

909
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,770
because I don't want I just like rotten

910
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:08,700
fruit to be throwing back and forth

911
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:10,880
across the room yeah

912
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:13,710
but as far as what we're doing I think

913
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,290
clearly we are not doing enough clearly

914
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:18,810
I think at the federal level the

915
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:22,710
government appears to have other

916
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:25,320
priorities at the moment place in parts

917
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:28,200
of life so I think we're probably so we

918
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:31,470
need to do better but we just haven't I

919
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:35,609
don't think we've really fully protected

920
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:38,149
ourselves against another 2016 yeah

921
00:42:35,609 --> 00:42:41,220
we'll find out about a year right other

922
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:44,119
questions comments

923
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,118
snide remarks yeah

924
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:34,619
decided to hold CIA source yeah so what

925
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,520
are we doing to incentivize people to do

926
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:41,039
things like you know work for CIA FBI I

927
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,920
said all right so unlock everyone

928
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:46,500
they're competing to pay us enough right

929
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:49,410
so I don't know kind of what their pay

930
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:52,140
structures like I do know that people

931
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:54,859
like the FBI are talking to me trying to

932
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:57,118
get my students to come work for them

933
00:43:54,859 --> 00:43:59,098
they do have a hard time paying as much

934
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:03,150
as the students are going to get in the

935
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:05,099
private sector you also you know you can

936
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:07,410
go work for a crowd strike and do cool

937
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:09,049
stuff and you don't have to run a mile

938
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:11,578
and a half at under ten minutes right

939
00:44:09,049 --> 00:44:15,480
like you do for the FBI or whatever the

940
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:16,950
number is so those guys do have a are at

941
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,819
a disadvantage when it comes to you know

942
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:24,930
compared to private sector but I mean I

943
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:27,089
do know that you know we have recently I

944
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:29,578
think kind of in in the u.s. we have a

945
00:44:27,089 --> 00:44:30,808
Cyber Command which is separate from you

946
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:32,039
know then Department of Defense let's

947
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:35,490
have a command which is separate from

948
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:37,230
like the infantry and so on so I know at

949
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:40,950
the DoD level we're sort of putting more

950
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:42,569
emphasis into it that you know the DoD

951
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:44,490
is not the ones out there protecting the

952
00:44:42,569 --> 00:44:47,910
private industry I think the sort of

953
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:50,038
decentralized nature of the United

954
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:51,660
States not only in terms of critical

955
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:53,490
infrastructure but also in terms of

956
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:57,538
state government local government County

957
00:44:53,490 --> 00:45:00,270
government really limits what the feds

958
00:44:57,539 --> 00:45:01,980
can do so I think we're always going to

959
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:04,259
be kind of in a reactive mode because of

960
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,630
that and you know I think you make a

961
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:08,880
good point that the other you know

962
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:11,690
smaller countries with maybe you know

963
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,690
maybe a more

964
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:17,290
it's been more powerful more powerful

965
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:19,540
but maybe a you know a more central

966
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:21,509
government probably has a better good

967
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:24,599
time of it than we do yes sir

968
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,599
[Music]

969
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:57,299
yeah I wasn't wear that so thanks for

970
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:57,300
DDS digital defense services great

971
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,310
and Kenneth similar that I can't the

972
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:08,200
name of it but there's this new sort of

973
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:10,960
government internship kind of thing for

974
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,609
cybersecurity people where you do

975
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,260
basically an internship for a

976
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:16,630
cybersecurity student you do an

977
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:18,910
internship with the feds you owe them

978
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:20,440
like a couple years afterwards and then

979
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:21,549
they sort of help you can over the

980
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:23,010
private company it's okay

981
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:24,970
I think a little bit almost like the

982
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:27,570
flip side but you're describing right

983
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:31,629
where you or the DDS invites private

984
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:33,850
company experts in here they're trying

985
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:35,800
to you know the feds say we'll give you

986
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:37,150
a good high quality internship you know

987
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,470
if you do two years with us and then

988
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:41,410
