1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,040
hey everyone and welcome to my talk

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,519
today in order to have future foresights

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,440
it requires that we look back at events

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,280
that have already taken place and that

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,199
is what i'll be doing in my talk today

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,359
i'll be presenting a retrospective of

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,800
2021 and do some analysis and insights

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,119
of some of the major security news and

9
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,199
events that have taken place over the

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,279
past year just a quick introduction

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,599
about myself i'm a cloud architect i

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,440
specialize in security and enterprise

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,680
cloud architecture and i help large

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,719
organizations adopt aws my research

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,960
interests include privacy surveillance

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,879
encryption and disinformation and i'm

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,200
also involved in policy advocacy work on

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,440
these topics as they relate to national

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,760
security interests i'm also a bit of a

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,160
aerospace nerd my twitter handle is at

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,160
jared nordia and my blog is at

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,000
criticalvoid.com

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,520
in my talk today i'm going to be talking

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,320
about the year of the supply chain 2021

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,000
has really been the year of the supply

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,559
chain with many supply chain issues as

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,119
well as supply chain attacks i'll also

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,200
be talking about some other issues for

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,680
example about the apple csam debacle

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,400
disinformation the cybersecurity review

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,320
board ransomware trends as well as

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,920
the software bull of materials as well

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,320
2021 was really a challenging year for

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,759
the supply chain

35
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,000
fire drought geopolitics and the

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,320
pandemic really stretch the supply

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,320
chains to their breaking points and

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,759
there is a worldwide shortage of rubber

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,320
lumber a specific type of chlorine due

40
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,960
to a massif fire at a production

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,159
facility

42
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,960
a shortage of semiconductors and chips

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,159
which have

44
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,960
had a massive impact in the automotive

45
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,240
industry as well as in the shipping

46
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,479
and transportation industry as well

47
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,719
where there isn't enough containers as

48
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,719
well as very long wait times at the

49
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,200
various ports obviously we all had a

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,119
joke at the ever given that got stuck in

51
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,680
the service canal but really the big

52
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,360
challenge here is that due to the

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,679
pandemic consumer spending has shifted

54
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,000
away from services to consumer goods

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,800
which has created a massive

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,280
demand for these consumer goods

57
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,360
texas also had a massive issue earlier

58
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,000
this year where they were not able to

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,160
meet the electricity's

60
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,280
demand

61
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,599
with the supply due to cold weather and

62
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,040
they were actually four minutes away

63
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,840
from experiencing a total grid collapse

64
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,000
in the digital world we had a number of

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,920
supply chain attacks and probably one of

66
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,080
the largest supply chain attacks that

67
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,640
ever took place against solarwinds which

68
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,040
really started out with the fire eye

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,599
breach in december of last year firearm

70
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,680
detected a malicious activity on its

71
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,800
network a user account that had newly

72
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,000
registered

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,680
mfa device

74
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,280
which was also used as a secondary

75
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,519
device triggered an initial alert which

76
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,920
then triggered a massive investigation

77
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,400
to kick off firearm knew immediately

78
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,800
that a nation-state actor was behind

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,120
this breach due to the crack tradecraft

80
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,120
that was being used during this

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,560
investigation

82
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,680
farah honed in on the solar winds

83
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,560
deployment and they reversed engineered

84
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,440
the code to actually find 4 000

85
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,159
lines of malicious code that was added

86
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,159
into solarwinds

87
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,920
for those of you that are not familiar

88
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,799
solarwinds is a item service

89
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,360
platform that provides remote management

90
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,799
and monitoring as well as some other

91
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:33,840
features

92
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,120
for it service management and due to its

93
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,599
specific function it actually requires

94
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,239
privileged access to some of these

95
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,879
systems in order for it to work

96
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,720
the main issue with the solar wind

97
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,480
supply chain attack was that in the cicd

98
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,720
system when they released software one

99
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,120
of the components was a jenkins machine

100
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,040
which was exposed to the internet with

101
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,840
the password of

102
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,840
adversaries were able to

103
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,319
break into that jenkins machine and then

104
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,040
able to add malicious code

105
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,959
which would create c2 channels as well

106
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,159
as web shells on victim infrastructure

107
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,560
from a timeline perspective in august

108
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,279
2019 the initial command and control

109
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,519
setup was done in october 2019 a dry run

110
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,080
of the attack took place and in december

111
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,360
2019 the first payload with cobbled

112
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,680
struck was actually detected a lot of

113
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,520
commentary has been made in the

114
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,120
community about the fact that they were

115
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,320
using a cobalt truck given that a cob a

116
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,840
lot of security tools can actually

117
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,880
detect cobalt struck and it would seem a

118
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,520
bit unintuitive to actually use cobble

119
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,479
truck in an attack of this nature

120
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,240
malware known as sunburst was actually

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,720
then injected into the orion platform in

122
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,400
february of 2020 and in march of 2020

123
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,800
the first sound backdoor version of the

124
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,040
solarwinds platform was actually

125
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,680
released to customers who received it

126
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,080
through an update process

127
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,320
at the end of december

128
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,440
fire

129
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,440
announced that they had been a victim of

130
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,199
a nation-state attack

131
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,840
fire disclosed the supply chain attack

132
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,400
to solarwinds who thereafter then

133
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,280
notified the customers as well as filed

134
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,039
the sec statement

135
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,800
for their shareholders

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,199
what's very interesting uh

137
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,520
the finger was pointed at this being a

138
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,000
russian operation very quickly however

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,639
president trump at the time uh insisted

140
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,400
that this was a chinese attack and

141
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,639
rather than a russian attack and at the

142
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,479
end of december to 2020 uh microsoft

143
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,919
actually announced that some of its

144
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,080
source code had actually been breached

145
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,720
as part of this

146
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,199
and as the new year started so that

147
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,199
would be the beginning of this year

148
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,720
a lot of people started realizing that

149
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,120
this was going to be a fairly

150
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,600
significant breach and a joint statement

151
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,759
by the fbi caesar

152
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,919
the national intelligence office as well

153
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,680
as the nsa really alerted people to this

154
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,280
significant breach

155
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,280
in terms of impact

156
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,919
this attack allowed adversaries to get

157
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,479
access to microsoft source code as well

158
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,520
as to the saml signing tokens for 40

159
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,000
companies which allow attackers to log

160
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,160
into services and infrastructure

161
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,479
directly without mfa

162
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,120
in most cases when you log into

163
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,280
something with saml that's typically

164
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,600
done by some kind of identity platform

165
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,000
and by having those keys you effectively

166
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,479
can bypass that

167
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,240
infrastructure which would also then

168
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,039
enforce mfa in the process the access

169
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,680
gained by the adversaries allowed them

170
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,720
to move laterally in the customer

171
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,440
environments of microsoft customers as

172
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,000
well and 30 percent of the private and

173
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,680
government businesses affected by the

174
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,880
breach had no known link to solarwinds

175
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,960
a number of u.s agencies were affected

176
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,199
by the breach and up to

177
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,680
000 private and public entities were

178
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,240
directly affected by the supply chain

179
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,120
breach

180
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,840
microsoft president brad smith was

181
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,240
ordered to testify in front of congress

182
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,840
and he was actually grilled about

183
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,720
microsoft's licensing policies where a

184
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,960
lot of logging features for example are

185
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,680
not available on the lower tier plans

186
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
this is one of i think microsoft's big

187
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,000
failures from a licensing perspective

188
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,080
and on the side notes i think

189
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,919
you know if you compare this to aws for

190
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,880
example this is one area where aws

191
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,960
actually does really well actually

192
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,479
another supply chain attack that we

193
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,720
learned of is a code cov which is a code

194
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,160
coverage tool adversaries were able to

195
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,400
use a vulnerability to gain access to a

196
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,720
vulnerable docker container where they

197
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,280
were able to change the ip address of a

198
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,360
specific configuration file which

199
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,000
allowed them to pull sensitive

200
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,199
environment variables out of codecov's

201
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,000
customers which included a number of big

202
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
names including hashicorp the

203
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,840
washingtonpostmonday.com

204
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,599
and uber

205
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,759
some companies had limited exposure for

206
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,560
example hashicorp only had its bgp

207
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,039
key exposed whereas other companies had

208
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,960
more sensitive credentials exposed

209
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,960
another interesting supply chain attack

210
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,400
was that on cassette vsa cassette vsa is

211
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,800
a remote monitoring and management tool

212
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,960
primarily used by msps to manage

213
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,919
customer networks a vulnerability

214
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,799
allowed an authentication bypass on the

215
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,120
platform where attackers could install

216
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,760
malware on the hosts managed by the

217
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,839
specific

218
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,240
platform affected systems were encrypted

219
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,480
with ransomware from the revo group and

220
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,160
the revo group claimed that over a

221
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,399
million systems were actually infected

222
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,279
where

223
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,040
this was actually disputed by cassaya

224
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,600
they said that between 800 and one and a

225
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,200
half thousand systems were actually

226
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,440
impacted

227
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,920
one of the most notable impacts was a

228
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,040
swedish

229
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,959
retailer called coop

230
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,360
800 stores had to close down due to

231
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,720
their payment systems not being

232
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,800
available and this actually had an

233
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,440
impact on the food supply chain in some

234
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,240
small villages where coop was the only

235
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,519
retailer

236
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,080
a food retailer in that area another

237
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,680
interesting attack

238
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,640
was on travis ci a vulnerability in

239
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,959
travis cr allowed environment variables

240
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,880
to be exposed during the build phase

241
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,600
this meant that open source code

242
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,519
could be used to actually retrieve

243
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,680
environment variables of systems using

244
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,800
travis ci and to make this even worse

245
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,720
travis here i actually tried to hide

246
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,880
this from their customers

247
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,720
once it was actually disclosed to them

248
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,720
which i think is completely unacceptable

249
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
the next attack was against the linux

250
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,320
kernel

251
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,640
an assistant professor at the university

252
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,000
of minnesota

253
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,839
actually tried to fix real bugs in the

254
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,720
linux kernel but in the process of doing

255
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
so also intentionally introduced new

256
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,360
security flaws as part of a research

257
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,720
project

258
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,600
this led to the university of minnesota

259
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,200
getting banned from the development on

260
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,839
the linux kernel as the open source

261
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,839
community found that this behavior was

262
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,800
completely unethical

263
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,480
one of the other interesting things from

264
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,920
a supply chain perspective was

265
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,640
compromised packages so there have been

266
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,600
a very large number of new

267
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,720
uh mpm packages registered i think after

268
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,480
the solarwinds breach everybody wanted

269
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,640
to get into the

270
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,680
supply chain attack and you can see on

271
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,320
the right hand side there how many new

272
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,160
npm packages were actually registered at

273
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,079
the beginning of this year following the

274
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,320
solomon's breach and what attackers

275
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,160
would do is they would use compromised

276
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,920
repositories and accounts to add

277
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,360
malicious code to popular npm packages

278
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,519
and those included uipulsa rc coa and

279
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,000
web browser file which together have

280
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,680
over 30 million downloads per week

281
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,519
tapas squatting was

282
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,760
also on the increase this year with over

283
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,839
3 600 packages on pop pi with similar

284
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,720
names that also contained malicious code

285
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,600
another interesting discovery made

286
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,160
earlier this year was this issue of

287
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,640
dependency confusion this is a risk

288
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,920
where ides and package managers are

289
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,360
unsure whether to

290
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,959
fetch a package from an internal

291
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,640
repository or external repository so

292
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,000
you could tell

293
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,800
a system to go get a specific package

294
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,120
and if it fetched the wrong one for

295
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,680
example from an outside source you could

296
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,279
actually introduce

297
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,760
malicious code into the system by doing

298
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,640
so

299
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,279
a researcher actually managed to do this

300
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,680
into apple microsoft and dozens of other

301
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,880
companies

302
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,120
some other notable supply chain attacks

303
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,519
that have taken place in the post an

304
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,480
attacker distributed a version of xcode

305
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,200
which was backdoored and what it would

306
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,920
do is whenever new ios applications were

307
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,839
created it would actually inject this

308
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,240
malicious code into the ios

309
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,880
app that xcode then created this

310
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,120
resulted in thousands of compromised

311
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,360
apps on the ios app store in march 2016

312
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,320
a popular open source bittorrent client

313
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,440
trans

314
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,920
mission was compromised to include mac

315
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,279
os ransomware in its installer

316
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,920
in june 2017

317
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,680
the not picture malware was actually

318
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,160
spread through a breach at a ukrainian

319
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,600
software company

320
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,920
and this then turned into a wormable

321
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,519
exploit that did spread worldwide

322
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,519
and affected many organizations in the

323
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,720
process

324
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,600
and a few months later avast sea cleaner

325
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,360
tool was also

326
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
compromised and used to attack large

327
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,600
technology and communications companies

328
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,839
worldwide another interesting supply

329
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,760
chain attack which was actually not done

330
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,079
by malicious actors but rather by law

331
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,120
enforcement the fbi actually managed to

332
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,399
shut down

333
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,839
and arrest the uh operations team of

334
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,920
incra chat and phantom secure these are

335
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,279
platforms used by the underworld to

336
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,680
for drug trafficking as well as other

337
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,160
nefarious activities and

338
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
after the fbi did this they realized

339
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
that there would be a massive

340
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,000
hole left in the underground market for

341
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,639
a secure messaging platform and they had

342
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,399
this brilliant idea of creating their

343
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,399
own backdoor

344
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,560
secure messaging platform that they

345
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,959
would want to share with all of uh their

346
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,880
members of the underground so that's

347
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,720
exactly what they did they teamed up

348
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,079
with the

349
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,639
australian federal police and europol

350
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,519
to basically set up a bunch of secure

351
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,639
backdoor phones and they then created a

352
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,720
new service called the nom

353
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,880
that was only available on purchase

354
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,920
devices they already used the trust

355
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,240
networks that were already

356
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,120
presence in the underworld and

357
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,440
they ensured that the the system was

358
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,760
only invite only and they used

359
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,600
influencers in the underground to

360
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,160
basically spread these devices around

361
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,199
and the scarcity uh made people believe

362
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,959
that this platform was actually really

363
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,959
secure

364
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,279
what they also did is they used a clever

365
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,279
cryptography so that

366
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,680
the messages were into end encrypted but

367
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,279
they had the master key so that they

368
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,040
could intercept and decrypt all of the

369
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,360
messages as they were being sent around

370
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,839
the world and the fbi let the service

371
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,800
run from eight to 2018 to 2021

372
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,360
and during this period uh 200 million

373
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,800
messages were intercepted from 11 800

374
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,279
devices in over 90 countries

375
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,600
and yes a map you can see uh law

376
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
enforcement agencies in north america

377
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,399
europe and australia and new zealand

378
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,600
were involved in this operation

379
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,880
when arrests started to take place they

380
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
seized a large amount of currency as

381
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,480
well as phones you can see a specific

382
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,560
you know drug trafficking arrangement

383
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,839
taking place here they also then went uh

384
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,680
to seize the drugs that were being

385
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,279
currently trafficked

386
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,199
and you can see a number of interesting

387
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,639
containers

388
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,959
as this occurred

389
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,440
more than 800 suspects were arrested and

390
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,199
more than 40 tons of drugs were actually

391
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,600
seized as part of this operation as well

392
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,560
as 250 firearms were seized

393
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,639
one notable thing about this is that the

394
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,959
fbi routinely complains that they are

395
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,279
going dark due to encryption but one

396
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,120
thing we can actually take away from

397
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,360
this is that actually these initiatives

398
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,440
allow law enforcement you know to go

399
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,160
after their targets without requiring uh

400
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,639
back doors in our

401
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,279
on our phones

402
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,279
moving on to ransomware

403
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,120
over the past few years ransomware has

404
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,360
really exploded in both the number of

405
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,800
victims as well as the amount of money

406
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,519
paid to ransomware groups

407
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,680
the infection mechanisms have changed

408
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,759
somewhat in the past that was always a

409
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,880
system compromise whereas today phishing

410
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,600
as well as software vulnerabilities are

411
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,240
becoming the primary entry point for

412
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,519
ransomware the internet crime sensor has

413
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,560
actually noticed a 62 increase in

414
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,759
reporting of ransomware tax

415
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,680
on the first based on the first half of

416
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,759
the year compared to the previous year

417
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,639
and you can also see some of the common

418
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,320
variants that are affecting people

419
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,079
around the world

420
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,079
one thing that people don't often note

421
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,720
is how organized these ransomware groups

422
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,399
actually are they actually have

423
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,759
affiliate programs that they they market

424
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,000
and this really allows them to scale

425
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,759
appropriately

426
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,880
and

427
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,800
when we start looking at ransomware as a

428
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,040
service um you know many people are not

429
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,279
actually aware that you know there's

430
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,279
actually the ransomware group which

431
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,839
creates the actual malware there's the

432
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,000
affiliates which actually then go

433
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,799
infect and attack people as well as deal

434
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,079
with the operations of of running the

435
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,280
ransomware

436
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,559
and the typically during an attack um

437
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,880
the ransomware group would give an

438
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,480
affiliate

439
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,559
software that has a unique id so that

440
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,880
the ransomware group can actually track

441
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,039
the targets that they are hitting and

442
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,919
when a victim is actually infected with

443
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,319
ransomware they would typically the

444
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,120
victim would pay the affiliate

445
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,520
which would take a 75 to 90 percent cut

446
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
of the ransom and the ransomware group

447
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,039
would get a 10 to

448
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,520
25 percent cut of the ransom so

449
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,120
sometimes the ransomware group and

450
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,640
affiliates will actually work together

451
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,960
when they go after a large target

452
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,799
and sometimes the media thinks that both

453
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,880
the ransomware group and the affiliate

454
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,640
is actually one entity when it actually

455
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,760
it's two

456
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,520
completely separate entities and this

457
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,320
can lead to some interesting factual

458
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,000
errors when

459
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,799
they report on these stories

460
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,960
one of the benefits um of having this

461
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,200
affiliate model from a ransomware group

462
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,360
perspective is that they can scale their

463
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,280
business to have multiple affiliates and

464
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,240
therefore

465
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,240
a lot more targets one of the other

466
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,720
things the ransomware group does as well

467
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,880
is that they actually use

468
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,799
master key encryption so that the

469
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,000
ransomware

470
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,360
group has the master key so that when

471
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,679
affiliates go attack victims and if they

472
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,960
were to attack a high profile victim the

473
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,440
the ransomware group would be able to

474
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,720
offer a decryption tool to the victim

475
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,960
bypassing the affiliate in that case

476
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,039
and then many affiliates will actually

477
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,559
use multiple

478
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,480
variants of ransomware from different

479
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,480
groups to try evade detection from law

480
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,360
enforcement as well as some ransomware

481
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,840
groups don't allow affiliates to attack

482
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,000
certain targets so for example some

483
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,320
ransomware groups won't attack hospitals

484
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,360
while others have no problem in doing so

485
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,200
one of the interesting supply chain

486
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,039
attacks from a ransomware perspective

487
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,960
that took place was at the attack

488
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,039
against colonial pipeline

489
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,480
where an unpatched legacy vpn was used

490
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,640
by the dark side ransomware group to

491
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,880
encrypt all of their systems and they

492
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,080
demanded a 4.4 million dollar ransom the

493
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,880
colonial pipeline processes

494
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,919
45 of all of the fuel in the us

495
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,960
and this led to a number of fuel

496
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,559
shortages as

497
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,039
people were holding fuel including some

498
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,120
unintelligent people who

499
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,640
for example this person on the right

500
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,440
hand side of the screen who used the top

501
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,360
inside his pickup truck and then filled

502
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,559
it up

503
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,559
with fuel which is not a very smart

504
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,160
thing to do

505
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,799
after this attack had taken place and

506
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,880
could the colonial pipeline had actually

507
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,679
paid out the ransom um 2.3 million

508
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,559
dollars went to the affiliate and 2.1

509
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,400
million dollars went to the dark side

510
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,559
ransomware group the justice department

511
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,039
was actually able to seize and recover

512
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,039
2.3 million dollars

513
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,480
of the 4.4 million dollar ransom payment

514
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,320
another

515
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,880
large ransomware attack was against jbs

516
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,679
which

517
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,480
is the world's largest meets

518
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,520
processor based in the us and australia

519
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,440
the rival group was behind this and they

520
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,000
demanded an 11 million dollar

521
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,039
ransom

522
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,880
last year i spoke about

523
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
somebody that passed away after a

524
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,440
ransomware attack hit a hospital which

525
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,520
actually delayed treatment

526
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,919
and a subsequent investigation actually

527
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,520
turned out that the patient died of

528
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,919
other causes although the ransomware

529
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,840
incident was actually a factor in the

530
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,240
death what came to light this year was

531
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,679
actually

532
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,360
the first death that's actually almost

533
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,280
directly attributable to ransomware

534
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,080
an expectant mother went to a hospital

535
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,520
to deliver

536
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,760
her baby and she was not aware that the

537
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,320
hospital was actually in the process of

538
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,640
recovering from a ransomware

539
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,120
attack the ransomware attack took out

540
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,000
the

541
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,640
rt network that the hospital was using

542
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,960
and this rt network supported vital

543
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,360
monitoring systems that would look at

544
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,480
fetal

545
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,640
vital signs and this was not

546
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,440
communicated back to the nursing staff

547
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,640
who was looking after this mother-to-be

548
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,960
and they were not aware that the baby

549
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,440
was actually distressed as the umbilical

550
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,520
cord was actually wrapped around

551
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,320
the baby's head and this led to severe

552
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,240
brain damage and the baby then passed

553
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,559
away nine months after

554
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,880
birth this came to light this year

555
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,480
because the family is currently suing

556
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,880
the hospital because they argue that had

557
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,919
they known that the hospital was under a

558
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,840
ransomware attack they probably would

559
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,360
have gone to another hospital

560
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,360
the response from the federal government

561
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,720
to ransomware has been quite fierce

562
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,280
the fbi and state department have

563
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,000
offered a reward of 10 million dollars

564
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,400
to the dark side ransomware

565
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,600
group

566
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,480
as well as a separate reward for 10

567
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,559
million dollars for

568
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,400
targeting the leadership of the rival

569
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,799
ransomware group an additional 5 million

570
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,360
dollars for information of of the

571
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,520
affiliates or partners

572
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,039
one of the interesting things that

573
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,640
happened was that

574
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,440
paul nakasoni who's the director of the

575
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,039
nsa and the commander of cyber command

576
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,960
actually spoke at a recent conference

577
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,440
saying that you know in the past the fbi

578
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,679
always dealt with ransomware because it

579
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,080
was criminal activity however when

580
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,640
ransomware starts touching critical

581
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,200
infrastructure it now becomes a national

582
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,760
security issue and if you read between

583
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,679
the lines here what he's actually trying

584
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,080
to say is he actually believes that the

585
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,360
government should actually allow

586
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,840
intelligence agencies around the world

587
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,240
including the nsa to actually go after

588
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,640
these ransomware groups and cyber

589
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,760
command actually took out a bunch of

590
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,400
infrastructure from a number of

591
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,559
ransomware groups including darkside

592
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,480
actually after this event

593
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,679
one of the other things that the

594
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,840
government has done is they've set up a

595
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,320
number of resources including

596
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,480
a website where people can get immediate

597
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,360
help

598
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,039
during an incident

599
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,799
if they need to

600
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,679
they also went after the people behind

601
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,600
the kasaya vsa

602
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,960
breach

603
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,799
one of them has been arrested and the

604
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,520
other one is wanted by the fbi

605
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,520
in the indictment they claimed that

606
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,039
these two

607
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,320
affiliates

608
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,080
they were able to get 6.1 million

609
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,000
dollars from the various attacks that

610
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,320
they were involved in

611
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,000
earlier in may

612
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,840
president joe biden actually signed an

613
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,240
executive order to improve the nation's

614
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,559
cyber security as part of this they

615
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,880
wanted to improve the software supply

616
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,080
chain security as well as incident

617
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,120
response as well as the security posture

618
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
in the federal government

619
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,400
in 2018 cesar was actually created but

620
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,840
they realized that they actually need to

621
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,880
go further than that so um the office of

622
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,760
the national cyber director was created

623
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,080
biden hosted a number of tech ceos to

624
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,159
at a security summit to discuss how they

625
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,799
can actually improve cyber security and

626
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,679
when

627
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,240
joe biden actually spoke to vladimir

628
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,200
putin

629
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,760
he actually warned him that russia needs

630
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,640
to take action on these groups

631
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,720
as well

632
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,000
the nsa released kubernetes hardening

633
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,919
guidance as well as

634
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,919
guidance for securing

635
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,559
5g cloud infrastructures they also put

636
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,120
out guidance on how to embrace

637
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,440
a xero trust security model and they

638
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,919
really hope that many u.s government

639
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,159
agencies will actually start migrating

640
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,559
their architecture into a zero trust

641
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,480
model which would have a significant

642
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,760
impact on

643
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,440
the nation's cyber security posture

644
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,799
one of the other initiatives is uh

645
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,559
the creation of a software bill of

646
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,840
materials so the idea behind this is to

647
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,080
manage vulnerabilities to have

648
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,320
software inventory software licensing

649
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,640
and supply chain data as well as

650
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,720
tracking component metadata in

651
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,039
enterprise software and the way that

652
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,080
this would be done is whenever a new

653
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,000
piece of software is released

654
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
all of the high level components are

655
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,880
detailed in those documents

656
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,440
what the version is other identifiers

657
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,279
the dependency

658
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,640
relationships and this would effectively

659
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,600
allow these systems to be able to track

660
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,000
when a specific component is actually

661
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,159
vulnerable what other systems could

662
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,159
actually be affected by that

663
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,159
vulnerability

664
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,559
at the security summit uh google

665
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,240
actually

666
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,000
committed to

667
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,960
securing open source so google already

668
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,440
has programs in place to actually

669
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,360
improve the security of open source

670
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,279
software but they've committed a whole

671
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,799
bunch of money to actually take this

672
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,559
even further

673
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,279
one of the big highlights of the

674
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,760
executive order on national security is

675
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,880
the formation of a cyber security safety

676
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,320
review board

677
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,279
and

678
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,520
the purpose of this is really to create

679
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,760
a board that can really investigate

680
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,919
cybersecurity incidents

681
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,400
so when a plane crashes that

682
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,799
is typically investigated by the

683
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,880
national transportation safety board or

684
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,480
the ncsb they're one of the most trusted

685
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,480
government organizations in the world

686
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,080
and their primary purpose is to

687
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,080
investigate transportation accidents

688
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,600
across aviation railroad highways marine

689
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,679
and pipelines and to make safety

690
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,840
recommendations when needed they've

691
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,400
completed over 150 000 accident

692
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,360
investigations and have made 15 000

693
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,360
safety recommendations

694
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,960
to 2400 recipients one of the main goals

695
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,880
of the ncsb is

696
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,039
to determine not just what happened but

697
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,400
why it happened so that it doesn't

698
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,760
happen again

699
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,480
and the ntsb is actually part of a

700
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,000
worldwide

701
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,480
group of agencies that do these kinds of

702
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,960
investigations and a lot of them have

703
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,200
bilateral agreements with one another in

704
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,480
order to

705
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,159
investigate various accidents especially

706
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,200
aviation accidents and we really need

707
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,360
something like the ntsb for cyber

708
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,360
security one of the problems that we

709
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,679
have in cyber security is with that when

710
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,559
breaches take place we often get second

711
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,120
hand or third hand information about

712
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,279
what actually happened and often the

713
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,200
information that is shared is often

714
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,679
actually just the um you know the

715
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,520
indicator of compromise

716
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,919
and or the attack factor but we don't

717
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,159
actually get any information

718
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,279
beyond that

719
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,159
and what we really need is for example

720
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,760
if an attack took place and there was a

721
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,200
monitoring system and the monitoring

722
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
system didn't detect it you know why

723
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,679
didn't did it detect it and if it did

724
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:08,799
detect

725
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,360
it um you know and somebody wasn't

726
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,520
notified what you know why wasn't that

727
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,000
the case and we really need to get

728
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,159
visibility into these kinds of failures

729
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,399
if we want to move forward as a cyber

730
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,840
security

731
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,760
community

732
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,760
these kinds of investigations exist in

733
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,279
many industries

734
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,000
but until we actually get a really

735
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,640
concrete solution for cyber security and

736
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,679
we're going to be kind of in this

737
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,360
this place that we have been in the past

738
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,000
so the ntsb has a very formal process of

739
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,120
how they investigate incidents so when

740
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,360
an accident occurs they establish

741
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,919
parties to the investigation and and the

742
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,480
investigation protocols they gather all

743
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,880
of the information that they can they'll

744
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,039
then actually brief the media where they

745
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,360
hand over this factual information that

746
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,840
they have at the time to the media they

747
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,399
will then hold investigative hearings to

748
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,559
get any additional information for

749
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,480
example from the vendors etc

750
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,399
and once all of this has been completed

751
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,480
and the investigation has been completed

752
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,799
um they will actually meet to finalize

753
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,559
the probable causes and safety

754
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,039
recommendations after which the report

755
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,200
has been released and just to give you

756
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,640
some examples of these reports in 2010

757
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,279
an a380 had a fan

758
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,080
bladeout event that actually

759
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,320
caused shrapnel from the engine to

760
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,320
actually sever the electronic trunks in

761
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,760
the airplane

762
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,039
which made

763
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,480
controlling the airplane fairly

764
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,760
difficult and it was only due to proper

765
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,240
crew resource management that the pilots

766
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,559
managed to land the plane safely and

767
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,320
interestingly enough crew resource

768
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
management was actually something

769
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,600
introduced by

770
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,679
the ntsb a few

771
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,399
uh many years ago

772
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,279
to help decision-making in cockpits

773
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,080
one of the findings of this incident is

774
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,600
that when those

775
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,760
cables were actually severed

776
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,240
the pilots received over 400 alerts in

777
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,440
the cockpit and this was a problem for

778
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,279
them because they were overwhelmed by

779
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,000
the number of alerts so various system

780
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,120
changes were made to make that easier as

781
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,159
well as the fact that those electronic

782
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,240
cable trunks are no longer run together

783
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,520
they actually

784
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,200
are separated now

785
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,360
and it's not just big accidents that

786
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,120
need to be investigated but it's also

787
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,440
the near misses as well where you know

788
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,760
nothing major happened but there are

789
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,840
always lessons to be learned from you

790
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,640
know

791
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,760
near collisions or near mistakes or near

792
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,279
accidents as as well another example is

793
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,679
the miracle on the hudson so a plan

794
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,760
departed a new york

795
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,039
airport in 2009 it flew into a flock of

796
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,120
birds which resulted in dual engine

797
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,320
failure

798
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,080
the aircraft was actually ditched in the

799
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,480
water um everybody was rescued and there

800
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,880
was no fatalities um

801
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,760
what was observed uh during the

802
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,320
investigation is that um pilots can't

803
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,080
actually practice water landings in a

804
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,159
simulator because they didn't allow them

805
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,559
they didn't have the capability to do so

806
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,480
and many pilots thought that if you

807
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,799
actually landed a plane in the water

808
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,039
everybody would actually die so one of

809
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,279
the safety recommendations that came out

810
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,559
of this incident was that simulators

811
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,080
need uh

812
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,399
must allow pilots to practice water

813
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,760
landings earlier this year um a tron's

814
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,640
air quagga flight that departed hawaii

815
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,440
had a dual engine failure um the pilot

816
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,120
successfully ditched the plane in the

817
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,919
sea

818
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,440
they were rescued by the coast guard

819
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,600
they never had any injuries

820
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,240
but the interesting question to ask is

821
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,240
had they not been able to train in the

822
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,720
simulator to do the ditching

823
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,120
with this uh event have turned out any

824
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,960
differently

825
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,840
and there's just some images of the ntsb

826
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,000
during the recovery they actually pulled

827
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,600
out the plane about

828
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,080
two weeks ago you can see the front

829
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,760
parts of the pane

830
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,240
plane in this image as well as the rear

831
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,159
section and the reason this is so

832
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,159
important is to actually have a feedback

833
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,200
loop in the industry so the ntsb reports

834
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,240
are often

835
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,720
used in airline training

836
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,200
programs so that pilots can learn from

837
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,120
mistakes that have taken place and

838
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,799
there's also a dedicated youtube

839
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,480
community of

840
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
youtubers who actually take these

841
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,320
reports and actually make really high

842
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,440
quality

843
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,919
videos from those reports and even if

844
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,399
you're not interested in aviation

845
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,840
you know these videos are still quite

846
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,679
interesting

847
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,080
and it's not just aviation

848
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,960
this

849
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,679
expands across engineering as well so if

850
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:54,880
you

851
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,039
if you studied engineering you probably

852
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,440
would recognize this this is the hybrid

853
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,279
uh regency walkway collapse that killed

854
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:04,559
114 people

855
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,679
and this event resulted in

856
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,480
from a small design change that was done

857
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,200
and had obviously a tragic impact

858
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,440
the u.s chemical safety board also

859
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,840
investigates accidents in chemical

860
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,120
manufacturing

861
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,519
and again you know they use this as a

862
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,760
lesson to learn thing if we want to move

863
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,760
forward in the security community we

864
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,640
really do need an agency like this um to

865
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,039
be able to give us factual information

866
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,200
as well as to solve some of the common

867
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,679
challenges that people are having

868
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,600
i think one of the big challenges that a

869
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,480
lot of companies have is uh enterprise

870
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
crepeway uh one of my favorite

871
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,000
conference talks is actually uh by harun

872
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,760
who actually presented a talk around

873
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,440
how broken the enterprise security

874
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,120
business is at virus bulletin in 2019

875
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,799
and if you haven't seen it i would

876
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,200
recommend that you watch it and the

877
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,840
point that harun makes is that

878
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,320
you know we suck at uh evaluating

879
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,839
security products and i think when such

880
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,599
a review board

881
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,839
you know is created it will be able to

882
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,480
shed light on what products actually do

883
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,719
work and what actually products are

884
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,119
actually bad to close off this topic i

885
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,679
think we are in a sorry state when um

886
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,520
eight of the 25

887
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,359
most exploited vulnerabilities are

888
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,918
actually in security gear um 30 percent

889
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,760
of all of the vulnerabilities across the

890
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,839
us government are actually in their

891
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,719
security software and hardware and until

892
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,280
we start fixing the core issues behind

893
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,280
this i don't think we'll actually move

894
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,719
forward

895
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,440
from a security posture perspective

896
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,800
the next topic is disinformation or how

897
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
the supply of information has been

898
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,079
twisted

899
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,960
over the past year with the coronavirus

900
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,440
and there's been a large anti-vex

901
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,599
movement to

902
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,560
undermine the rollout of the covert 19

903
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,920
vaccine

904
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,359
they often

905
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,160
will spread false baseless claims with

906
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,119
emotionally charged imagery and language

907
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,359
to provoke an emotional response from

908
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,760
the reader and research done by the

909
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,520
center for countering digital hate

910
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,400
discovered that 12 individuals

911
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
called the dirty dozen were responsible

912
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,160
for 65 percent of all of the

913
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,680
disinformation

914
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,800
related to the coronavirus vaccine

915
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,720
and these individuals have a large

916
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,680
following

917
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,079
and have routinely you know pedaled

918
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,240
these base baseless clam about the

919
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,280
coronavirus and the vaccines and in

920
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,440
doing so many of them have generated a

921
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,960
large amount of revenue by pushing

922
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,040
alternative unproven treatments and

923
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,119
cures for cover 19.

924
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,960
a lot of them have books and webinars

925
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,680
and seminars that they have as well as

926
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,240
pools that they then sell and this is

927
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,560
obviously ironic because

928
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,160
many people won't take the vaccine

929
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,599
because they say they don't know what's

930
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,760
in it but they'll happily take a pull

931
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,480
from an unregulated person

932
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,920
which i think is quite

933
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,040
ironic

934
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,400
well this information around the

935
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,119
coronavirus vaccine may pose a public

936
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,480
health

937
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,359
issue

938
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,200
the real challenges when this

939
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,000
information is has been weaponized

940
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,720
to spread false baseless claims for

941
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,200
example the theory that the u.s election

942
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,280
was stolen you know this led to

943
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,760
real-world violence on january the 6th

944
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,320
during the insurrection of uh trump

945
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,280
supporters where the u.s capital was

946
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,880
actually um

947
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,000
attacked in a an in in an attempt to

948
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,040
overthrow uh the election

949
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,359
and this obviously raises you know the

950
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,920
issue of how do we actually you know

951
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,839
address these issues there was a rather

952
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,079
controversial op-ed in the new york

953
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,800
times about the limits that free speech

954
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,119
should have i personally believe in free

955
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,400
speech

956
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,040
however how do you actually go about

957
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,680
combating this information while making

958
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,599
sure that you don't infringe on free

959
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,880
speech

960
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,760
rights and this is really a whole a

961
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,760
heart problem this is really a hard

962
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,359
problem to solve next up is um the apple

963
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,079
see sam debacle of how apple you know

964
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,079
portrays its values

965
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,920
in the past apple has proclaimed that

966
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,160
privacy is one of its core values and

967
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,000
has routinely taken shots at its

968
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,560
competitors such as google regarding um

969
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,079
privacy however in august of this year

970
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,640
apple announced plans to put content

971
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,839
scanning technology on iphones to combat

972
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,880
child sexual abuse material or csam as

973
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,720
part of this announcement they also

974
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,400
announced initiatives to combat nudity

975
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,920
in messages i'm not going to go into

976
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,880
that

977
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,520
i'm going to focus on the csam issue

978
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,599
so how this would work is apple would

979
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,680
get a list of known csun material from

980
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,760
the national sensor for missing and

981
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,880
exploit to children um they will compare

982
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,119
the hashes of known csun images to

983
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,640
images on a particular user's iphone and

984
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,640
if the image matches

985
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,680
the photo

986
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,520
is encrypted with a safety voucher and

987
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,320
then is sent to apple apple will verify

988
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,400
the image hashes before

989
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,839
sending it back to the center

990
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,119
during that process

991
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,280
and then this would be reported to law

992
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,280
enforcement the response from the

993
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
security community was swift and clear

994
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,200
that this is a bad idea

995
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,800
and it was really great to see the

996
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,960
entire community really you know agree

997
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,280
on this even people that i typically

998
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,560
disagree with

999
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,119
actually you know said that this was a

1000
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,720
terrible idea

1001
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,800
one of the first problems is the hashing

1002
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,960
so in the past images were hashed with

1003
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,240
shot 256 and md5 and if the image was

1004
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,320
resized or encoded cropped or slightly

1005
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,040
altered it would generate a new hash

1006
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,800
apple try to fix this problem by

1007
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,280
creating a system called neural hash

1008
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,520
which looks at the content of the image

1009
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,119
in order to derive the hash so even if

1010
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,800
images are slightly different or have

1011
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
slightly different color the idea is

1012
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,599
that they regenerate the same hash apple

1013
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,359
claims that there is a one in one

1014
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,760
trillion chance of a hash collision but

1015
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,280
there's no way to actually test that

1016
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,000
because the census database only

1017
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,560
contains a few million images the second

1018
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,200
problem is around reporting requirements

1019
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,960
so under title 18 section 2258

1020
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,440
all platforms that allow user generator

1021
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,160
content to be uploaded to a platform

1022
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,160
must report any material that could

1023
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,599
contain

1024
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,720
csam

1025
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,560
and there are harsh penalties if a

1026
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,720
provider fails to do so

1027
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,520
and

1028
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,680
this leads to a situation where

1029
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,000
providers would rather report an image

1030
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,480
as potentially being csam rather than

1031
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,599
take the chance and be fined

1032
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,560
for for not reporting it and this

1033
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,040
creates a issue in the way that apple

1034
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,359
wants to actually use the system so as

1035
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,240
an example let's say you have a photo of

1036
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,359
two 18 year old teenagers

1037
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,839
engaged in sexual activity this is a

1038
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,400
legal image it gets uploaded to a social

1039
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,800
media platform like facebook or twitter

1040
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,520
facebook doesn't allow annuity but

1041
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,720
twitter does

1042
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,680
and the the images reported to the

1043
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,680
social media platforms

1044
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,119
they're not sure if it's legal so they

1045
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,960
take it down and they

1046
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,440
report it to the national center for

1047
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,880
missing and exploit

1048
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,359
to children and then this thing gets

1049
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,119
added to the database which then

1050
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,520
obviously updates apple's database and

1051
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
if somebody was looking at this image

1052
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,560
again a legal image the image hash would

1053
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,960
match this would then be sent to apple

1054
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,880
apple would do the verification they

1055
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,400
would send it back to the center and the

1056
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,920
center would then

1057
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,800
notify law enforcement and the law

1058
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,560
enforcement would then do a certain

1059
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,119
session warrant and this is really where

1060
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,839
one of the big challenges lies because

1061
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,480
even though the images were legal

1062
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,880
you know now somebody is having a

1063
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,640
certain seizure

1064
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,960
you know done against them and even

1065
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,880
though they are completely innocent this

1066
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,680
whole process has can so distrust with

1067
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,680
neighbors and can cause severe

1068
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,839
reputational damages even though the

1069
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,680
person is innocent

1070
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,160
and this is particularly problematic if

1071
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,319
for example the media actually then goes

1072
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,720
and reports about this investigation as

1073
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,760
well

1074
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,960
the second

1075
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,000
more problematic issue is around the

1076
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,760
fact that this content scanning

1077
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,800
technology can be repurposed

1078
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,400
for government surveillance and

1079
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,440
censorship so china or russia could

1080
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,800
actually force

1081
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,839
apple

1082
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,720
to actually use this technology

1083
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,880
to center images or

1084
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,040
for requests to bypass encryption

1085
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,720
if we look at china these are three

1086
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,480
images that are banned in china

1087
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,079
obviously the

1088
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,480
the the comparison of xi jinping to

1089
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,720
winnie the pooh the square

1090
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,920
incident as well as an artwork depicting

1091
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,359
river crabs which is a play on chinese

1092
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,880
words to mock communist rule and

1093
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,480
what the chinese government could say as

1094
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,400
well you know these three images you

1095
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,240
know are illegal and anybody that have

1096
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,640
them um you know could potentially face

1097
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,200
legal uh repercussions as a result of

1098
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,400
that

1099
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,160
and many people would say well you know

1100
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,520
these governments don't really have the

1101
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,720
power to do so however the evidence in

1102
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,319
the past have actually has actually

1103
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,960
demonstrated otherwise so earlier in

1104
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,160
this year

1105
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,160
alexia navalny who is the main

1106
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,280
opponent

1107
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,720
to vladimir putin actually created an

1108
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,440
app

1109
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,280
for tactile

1110
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,040
voting and

1111
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,440
the russian government reached out

1112
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,560
directly to the ceos of both apple and

1113
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,920
google to have this app removed from the

1114
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,560
app stores despite the fact that

1115
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,280
it wasn't violating any app store policy

1116
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,520
and russia claimed that refusing to do

1117
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,520
so would be treated as meddling in the

1118
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,560
preliminary election

1119
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,760
also china has a very firm grip on apple

1120
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,640
um

1121
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,319
in the past they have removed a lot of

1122
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,319
apps from the app store

1123
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,200
the apple was forced to put the icloud

1124
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,160
keys for china users inside of china as

1125
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,319
well as share quite a lot of data with

1126
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,160
the chinese government

1127
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,359
china is a key market for apple so even

1128
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,960
though apple

1129
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,760
you know

1130
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,920
even though there are human rights

1131
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,720
issues tim cook is on record saying that

1132
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,720
you know they have a responsibility to

1133
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,319
do business everywhere including china

1134
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:49,440
earlier the

1135
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,560
last month there was actually

1136
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,040
last month there was actually

1137
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,839
a

1138
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,200
research paper published which

1139
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,280
highlights a lot of these issues that

1140
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,400
i've just spoken about and um you know

1141
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,240
these government requests could really

1142
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,040
be a real threat and apple can't claim

1143
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,880
that it is impossible once they actually

1144
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,280
release this technology in the wild

1145
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,280
another thing to you know kind of think

1146
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,319
about is that recently australia passed

1147
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,880
a surveillance legislation amendment

1148
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,400
which allows

1149
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,160
them to force tech companies to help

1150
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,640
them with investigations and again they

1151
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,160
claim that

1152
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,640
you know this is meant to help deal with

1153
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,960
sea salmon terrorism however we've

1154
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,920
actually heard these arguments before

1155
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,920
as revealed by the snowden documents you

1156
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,640
know

1157
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,000
a lot of these governments you know

1158
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,640
claim that all of these laws and signal

1159
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,560
intelligence capabilities are used to

1160
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,119
fight you know terrorism and and csam

1161
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,680
etc however the evidence actually

1162
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,839
opposes that in many cases

1163
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,079
and the the

1164
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,440
you know the community has really been

1165
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,960
pushing back on this move by apple

1166
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,119
apple for its part actually says that

1167
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,480
you know this is one massive

1168
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,640
misunderstanding and you know this is

1169
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,480
just you know people are confused they

1170
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,319
don't really understand what's going on

1171
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,280
um and i don't actually you know by that

1172
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,800
you know this is actually quite a

1173
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,599
serious issue um one of the things that

1174
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,560
really you know enraged the security

1175
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,079
community was the fact that um an email

1176
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,079
sent by the national center for missing

1177
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,400
and exploited children after apple had

1178
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,240
released this you know basically

1179
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,319
congratulating and thanking them for for

1180
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,520
doing this

1181
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,079
you know had this infamous line uh where

1182
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,240
they say that the days to come will be

1183
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,000
filled with screeching voices of the

1184
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,800
minority and this really made a lot of

1185
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,920
people

1186
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,079
upset including myself because you know

1187
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,560
if we believe in privacy and civil

1188
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,800
liberties you know are we now a

1189
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,920
screeching voice of the um minority and

1190
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,240
this is a classic you know if you're not

1191
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,240
for us you're against those kind of

1192
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,720
argument which um i think is actually a

1193
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,599
lot of rubbish

1194
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,000
the community also then started putting

1195
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,599
petitions together

1196
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,480
this was an open letter

1197
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,160
requesting that

1198
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,760
apple

1199
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,960
stop

1200
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,560
the deployment of this content

1201
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,280
monitoring technology and that apple

1202
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,880
issue a statement reaffirming their

1203
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,359
commitment to end-to-end encryption um

1204
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,640
over eight and a half thousand

1205
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,920
individuals and thirty-four

1206
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,960
organizations uh signed this letter the

1207
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,200
electronic frontier foundation also

1208
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,000
created a call to action

1209
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,240
and 15 000 people actually signed this

1210
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,520
petition as well as 90 organizations

1211
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,720
co-signed this letter which was sent to

1212
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,200
the ceo of apple

1213
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,440
apple for its spot actually relented and

1214
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,599
actually decided to put all of their

1215
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:48,960
plans on hold

1216
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,520
mainly due to the fact that they didn't

1217
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,440
want this to overshadow the launch of

1218
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,920
the new iphone 13

1219
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,400
so they uh you know put this on pause

1220
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,079
however what the electronic frontier

1221
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,560
foundation did um on the day of the

1222
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,960
launch of the iphone 13 they actually

1223
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,000
flew a banner over apple park um you

1224
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,280
know to kind of protest uh this move by

1225
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,480
apple

1226
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,119
in closing um you know we shouldn't have

1227
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,680
to give up our civil liberties to fight

1228
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,240
csam or terrorism we know from the past

1229
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,680
that these things have very little

1230
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,640
impact and once you give up your civil

1231
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,760
liberties

1232
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,680
you don't actually get them back so this

1233
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,000
is no laughing matter and with that

1234
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,160
that's the end of my presentation i

1235
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,720
thank you very much
