1
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:09,920
well uh hi

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,240
everyone and thanks for tuning my talk

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,040
my name is

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,200
charles roth i go by angus reed and

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,480
today we're talking about open source

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,279
intelligence

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,960
the gateway drug your mother never told

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,359
you about

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,000
right so the outline of my talk today

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
i'll give a brief introduction to myself

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,800
um we'll then talk about what is urcent

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,320
why we do oceans

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,520
sort of why it is awesome the highs we

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,880
get from that

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,640
the side effects you know what you can

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,200
gain indirectly whether you

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,840
continue down a sort of a professional

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,680
line of oceans or just stop

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,840
there and move on with your life and

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,239
then we'll talk about feeding the supply

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,000
and then uh we'll take some questions

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,760
afterwards i'll be

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,520
on the discord if you need me

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,039
all right that's a brief introduction as

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,399
i said my name is charles roth i'm a

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,239
league technical security recruiter

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,520
i recruit predominantly in the united

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,359
states i do a little bit in the

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,760
eu and the uk and then also double some

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,680
some stuff here in south africa

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,960
i'm a former british british airborne

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,799
and i did about six years in higher

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,640
security consulting predominantly in

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,000
east and west africa

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,520
and then also some time in the middle

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,240
east locally and in the community i

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,000
involved with fair amount of conferences

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,640
i'm a co-organizer of b-sides cape town

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,400
i'm the founder of hacksaws along with

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,080
some very great people

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,079
and i'm an avid open source intelligence

42
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,159
analyst um

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,479
shout out to cryptic monks and de vet

44
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,200
for the

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,960
third place in the recent trace labs

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,840
which i'll discuss

47
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,680
momentarily right so what is open source

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,960
intelligence

49
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,799
okay so take it from uh take it from

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,399
wikipedia

51
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,159
i read directly it says open source

52
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,240
intelligence is a multi-method

53
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,720
qualitative and quantitative methodology

54
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,560
for collecting analyzing

55
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,200
and making decisions about data

56
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,880
accessible in publicly

57
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,439
publicly available sources to be used in

58
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,520
an intelligence context

59
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,200
in the intelligence community the term

60
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
open refers to

61
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,598
overt publicly available sources as

62
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,319
opposed to covert clandestine sources

63
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,080
it is not related to open source

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,920
software or collective intelligence

65
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,239
okay so open source intelligence under

66
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,440
one name or another

67
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,760
has been around for hundreds of years

68
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,200
with the advent of instant

69
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,640
communications and rapid information

70
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,599
transfer

71
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,360
a great deal of actionable and

72
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,800
predictive intelligence can now be

73
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,560
obtained from public unclassified

74
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,239
sources

75
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,000
right so typically the sources will

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
include media uh you know like print

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,800
media

78
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,280
magazines radio television uh the

79
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,720
internet which is the predominance of

80
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,760
what i do now

81
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,080
will be you know your facebooks your

82
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,440
linkedin twitters

83
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,560
instagrams uh blogs uh

84
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,680
message boards um anything sort of in

85
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,800
that sphere

86
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,720
uh public government data especially in

87
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,280
south africa is quite rarely accessible

88
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,159
uh you know looking at uh birth records

89
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,120
death records

90
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,519
property records that sort of stuff

91
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,959
anything that the government will push

92
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:07,280
out

93
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,200
also crpc is quite helpful here in south

94
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,480
africa

95
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,360
uh professional academic publications

96
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,920
which is

97
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,120
not so widely used but it's still viable

98
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,280
example i can use of that is if i

99
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,040
typically want to know someone

100
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,720
something about someone in this industry

101
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,400
that's given a few talks i'll typically

102
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,920
watch the first four or five minutes of

103
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,720
their talk

104
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,799
together introduction to see how they

105
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,159
introduce themselves and i'll take

106
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,319
information from that

107
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,360
next up we have uh commercial data which

108
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,680
i

109
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,519
don't use that much which includes

110
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,840
accession commercial imagery

111
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,280
financial industrial assessments and

112
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,959
databases

113
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,319
hopefully legally acquired databases

114
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,080
uh grey literature something i'm not

115
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
very familiar with this includes things

116
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,760
like sezio technical reports

117
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,959
pre-prints patents that sort of stuff

118
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,280
um and says at the end open source

119
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,720
intelligence is distinguished from

120
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,480
research in that it applies

121
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,159
the process of intelligence to create

122
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,000
tailored knowledge supportive

123
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
of a specific decision by specific

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,280
individual group

125
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,680
right so this is directly pulled from

126
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,319
from wikipedia

127
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,560
okay so why isn't what what what do i

128
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,839
and what do we use it for

129
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,360
right so on the fun side ctfs so

130
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,960
these are usually based on fake

131
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,280
information with fake

132
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,600
accounts in order to test someone's

133
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,199
ability to gather intelligence and

134
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,520
pieces together to form a hypothesis

135
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,600
um examples of this such as hack the box

136
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,720
challenges i've done a fair few of them

137
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,680
a friend of mine bushido he also spoke

138
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,080
at a recent con i was at conant

139
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,680
he's got one or two really fun

140
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,199
challenges to do that's called like a

141
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:47,919
story

142
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,400
line to it and then on twitter you also

143
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,880
get things like

144
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,960
ocean challenge which is trying to

145
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,560
identify the location

146
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,800
of where a photo was taken literally

147
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,240
just from a picture

148
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,080
or from a google maps uh um

149
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,440
screenshot right so typically a

150
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,639
challenge looks like this

151
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,039
so this is on hack the box so you'll see

152
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,960
here super secure startups

153
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,479
our private information is leaked can

154
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,320
you find out how there'll be a file to

155
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,680
download

156
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,440
now typically what you would do with

157
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,360
this is you would look for information

158
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,039
related to the company super secure

159
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,000
startup

160
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,759
you will try to find them on linkedin

161
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,360
try to find them on twitter

162
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,039
you'll see sort of where the path takes

163
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,400
you you'll see it who's

164
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,520
engaging with who who messages who

165
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,240
um and from that you basically pull a

166
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,080
password that unlocks this document

167
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,000
and then gives you the flag it's quite

168
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,680
fun but can be quite challenging on on

169
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,320
hack the box

170
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,919
right so the ocean challenge that i

171
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,840
mentioned this is one example so you've

172
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,240
got

173
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,919
uh jocksmith here i will originally went

174
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,280
on holiday about

175
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,840
three four weeks ago uh on the way to

176
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,960
pick a newscliff

177
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,199
um so i took a photo while i was driving

178
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,199
or while uh i was in the passenger seat

179
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,000
of course

180
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,639
uh took a photo and then i said you know

181
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,000
try find me

182
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,600
um and you see here he has the picture

183
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,080
that i took on the left and on the right

184
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,960
is a director paul from google uh where

185
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,319
he'd use the

186
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,520
mountains in the background uh

187
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,440
route markers and then a house on the

188
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,080
road to identify exactly where

189
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,400
the photo was taken and he was pretty

190
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,280
much bang on

191
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,479
right so the next thing is trace labs

192
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,160
so tracelabs is a ctf based on 2j812 it

193
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,720
can be

194
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,560
like the recent one five five to twelve

195
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,240
missing persons cases

196
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,639
it is the same as hack the box i seem to

197
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,280
challenge

198
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,080
your ability in open source intelligence

199
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,240
but with trace labs it is based on real

200
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,240
people and real cases and so it has a

201
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,520
real outcome

202
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,840
so with trace labs intelligence is

203
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,919
sought on cases

204
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,080
um we submit that we get points for the

205
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,599
things if they're validated

206
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,120
and then all that intelligence that we

207
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,680
gather is then given to law enforcement

208
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,000
i very often we do find the locations of

209
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,319
people or find locations within

210
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,080
the last couple of days or where someone

211
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,680
was despite them being missing for

212
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,319
hundreds even if not thousands of days

213
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,880
right really fun really good to do and

214
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,720
like i said it has a real

215
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,919
outcome at the end of it

216
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:20,880
all right so that's what it looks like

217
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
when you do well so this is from our

218
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,039
recent third place the trace labs

219
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,440
and this is a meme that big ldp from

220
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,280
tmhc made for us we became

221
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,319
seventh and one before last

222
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,479
was a very very very close competition

223
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,599
right so another use for

224
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,080
episode intelligence is red teaming and

225
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,440
social engineering

226
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,319
so many re-teamers will use open source

227
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,240
intelligence to gather intel on proposed

228
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,199
targets

229
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,960
they'll use that information to build a

230
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,879
picture of on their clients

231
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,560
in order to exploit vulnerabilities such

232
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,000
as the human factor using

233
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,840
social engineering and other

234
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,919
exploitation tactics

235
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,479
okay so this usually is formed uh forms

236
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,000
part of the recon phase

237
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,160
so you get you know a big name a red

238
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,000
teamer like jason e street

239
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,759
uh he just talked one said i think at

240
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,280
defcon or derbycon

241
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,879
where he mentions that he would do open

242
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,720
source intelligence but

243
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,280
to be fair to every client um he would

244
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,039
only start scratching around

245
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,240
to see who what and where people are

246
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,879
um i think he said only an hour before

247
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,800
an engagement or maybe the day before an

248
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,840
engagement

249
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,200
so you know so that everyone is given

250
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,880
equal opportunity to get get owned um

251
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,559
but yeah this forms part of the the

252
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,838
recon phase

253
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,160
okay so uh an indirect use and something

254
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,440
that i actually want to do a talk about

255
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,399
one day

256
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,560
is the indirect use so things like

257
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,920
property investment

258
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,120
so a straight example uh i was looking

259
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,279
at buying a property last year you know

260
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,519
buying something that's low-bulled and

261
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,959
then you know doing a fixed-wrapper

262
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,000
project

263
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,560
i found a a really nice house on a 2000

264
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,519
square property

265
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,519
in morisburg small farmers town

266
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,839
i want to understand as to why the house

267
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,240
was half a million rand

268
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,519
but it was two and a half thousand

269
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,519
square property

270
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,160
i then did some intelligence i i looked

271
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,800
up the

272
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,720
i've learned now that i need to find the

273
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,640
erf number the araf number

274
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,800
once found the artif number i looked at

275
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,640
uh

276
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,600
swat line departments uh records that

277
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,000
they

278
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,240
post every two three years on property

279
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,240
valuations so when they bring up their

280
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,279
rates

281
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,720
through that you i could find the the

282
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,399
name of the owner i can then do some

283
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,839
further intelligence

284
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,160
um and i quickly find out what was going

285
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,399
on at the house who owns a house

286
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,399
what activities gone and i quickly

287
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,680
realized you know

288
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,279
if i buy this house i'm gonna have a lot

289
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,200
of dramas probably a lot of debt

290
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,560
collectors coming in

291
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,399
and put a lot of people looking for some

292
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,760
stuff they shouldn't at two in the

293
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,560
morning

294
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,360
so you know i made a uh adverse decision

295
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:01,760
to

296
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,279
not invest in that property

297
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,040
okay so business development so you know

298
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,480
as a recruiter are the extensive open

299
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,000
source intelligence to understand my

300
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,839
clients or potential clients

301
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,519
what makes them tick and how to string

302
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,040
piece of information together

303
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,880
to execute a better pitch so support and

304
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,040
understand if you are a

305
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,440
you know a name brand company that most

306
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,240
people know about

307
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,519
i will know about it and i wouldn't

308
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,600
really have to do that much scratching

309
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,519
um it's all about you know just finding

310
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,720
an n

311
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
so um with companies that i don't know

312
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,480
so well but i know potentially doing

313
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,760
some interesting stuff

314
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,480
um you know i will i will do some basic

315
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,519
episodes intelligence

316
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,120
you know i'll conduct basic research on

317
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,800
the target and the people

318
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,200
i know and know them i'll build a

319
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,720
picture of the company and the people i

320
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,000
want to contact um

321
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,320
execute an outreach using some basic

322
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,160
info to help break the ice

323
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,640
and build familiarity you know i'm i'm

324
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,839
ex british army

325
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,839
so if i find someone in the company

326
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,680
that's ex-army works british on me i

327
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,160
will

328
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,320
try and go down that avenue to try to

329
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,360
break the ice

330
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,600
trouble some familiarity and then from

331
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,440
there i will attempt to

332
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,519
do you know a sort of a soft proposal to

333
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,360
see if i can work with that company

334
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,959
um i think some people see this as

335
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,480
business intelligence which it is to

336
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,000
some extent but

337
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,480
um it's just another useful for the for

338
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,720
the skill set

339
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,200
right interview prep this is actually i

340
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,279
i i it turns out i was doing open sales

341
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,800
intelligence a long time before

342
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,160
i knew it was called ocean so um

343
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,519
doing open source intelligence for an

344
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,200
int for interview prep

345
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,959
is really really valuable so as an

346
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,320
interviewer

347
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,440
and as an interviewee it's good to get

348
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,959
information on the company that you're

349
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,240
interviewing with

350
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,399
so that you can show them that you have

351
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,519
an interest and you have done your

352
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,480
research

353
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,000
so typically that'll be try

354
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,399
understanding where the company operates

355
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,040
um where the headquarters are what they

356
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,079
do

357
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,519
maybe understanding if there's any bad

358
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,440
press involved with the company

359
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,680
um what kind of people work there see if

360
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,440
you know any people there

361
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,360
um this kind of stuff will tend to help

362
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,720
you get a job you know when that

363
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,360
company will always ask you you know so

364
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,160
what do you

365
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,480
what do you know about us right and

366
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,240
that's your chance to say you know i

367
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,160
know you folks operate here here here

368
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,000
you do this that and the other

369
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,440
um i actually realized i have two

370
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,279
friends that work for you folks down in

371
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,800
you know joberg and durbin um

372
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,639
so you'll kind of give that information

373
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,000
until the company says like hey

374
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,680
you know that's that's cool thanks we

375
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
know we appreciate you did your research

376
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,160
but it takes that that that big box that

377
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,360
shows that you have an interest in the

378
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,519
company

379
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,639
and hopefully you get a job from that

380
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,160
right so canada vetting this is

381
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,839
something um i was asked in the lost

382
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:40,720
conference like

383
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,320
how deep will i do this so when i would

384
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,600
use open source televisions to do

385
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,440
candidate vetting it happens on a very

386
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,560
rare occasion

387
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,399
it is only if i have a sixth sense about

388
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:52,800
them

389
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,399
or a strange inkling as to them

390
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,399
there being a risk involved with this

391
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,240
candidate and their background

392
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,920
and their history and maybe trouble with

393
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,440
the law um

394
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,720
it's happened a few times i've spoken to

395
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
people in the us and it turns out they

396
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,399
have federal indictments

397
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,079
um you know we all make mistakes but

398
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,680
it's important to have that information

399
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,040
before you send someone to a company so

400
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,600
um you know also if you think someone's

401
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,480
you know

402
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
you can't not hire someone based on

403
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,839
their beliefs or what they do on the

404
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:22,800
weekend

405
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,560
but it's good to have that kind of

406
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,320
information uh

407
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,560
before the time uh it's important to

408
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,480
reiterate me in recruiting i have done

409
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,360
this

410
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,000
literally a handful of times it's not

411
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,360
something i have to do very often

412
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,680
okay so the drugs so why is it so

413
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,000
awesome

414
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,360
right so it's important to understand

415
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
the ease of entry so what it takes

416
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,079
to to do open source intelligence or to

417
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,360
be able to conduct it

418
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,839
effectively right so let's look at what

419
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,720
we require

420
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
okay so these are the the prerequisites

421
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,639
right

422
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,000
so ideally you need a computer or

423
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,720
smartphone if you're smart you can use

424
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
your computer with a vm

425
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,519
as i typically use but you know if you

426
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,959
needed some basic stuff

427
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,519
a standard computer or a smartphone will

428
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,639
do

429
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,399
okay you needed access to the internet

430
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,240
as that's going to be where you find

431
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,760
the majority of your information

432
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,600
okay curiosity you have to have some

433
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,040
sense of curiosity

434
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,959
if you like watching murder mysteries on

435
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,320
netflix and

436
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,120
you know stuff like that it means you

437
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,079
have that curiosity

438
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,079
to go go out and find stuff

439
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,480
next is understanding uh the rules of

440
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,760
engagement

441
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,560
so the typical rules engagement to keep

442
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,519
safe

443
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,839
is what we call zero touch so it means

444
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,560
you will never engage or interact with

445
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,639
any form of intelligence that you find

446
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,160
if you find an instagram uh profile

447
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,079
you will not follow that profile even if

448
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,720
you have a sock account um

449
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,880
you never want that to come back to you

450
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,399
and your sort of

451
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,560
your data being tagged to that person's

452
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,079
profile and then they end up being

453
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:06,639
murdered

454
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,920
you know so the rule is always zero

455
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,279
touch

456
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,040
never get involved and never use your

457
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,720
own personal profiles

458
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,000
in order to do intelligence

459
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,880
okay understanding what you want as an

460
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,320
outcome so it's important in

461
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,440
intelligence and

462
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,720
you know i guess with most things in

463
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,560
life it's important to understand

464
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,079
what you're trying to get out of this

465
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,560
like what what needs to be the end

466
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,360
result

467
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,040
like with the property stuff i want to

468
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,040
find out uh

469
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,880
honestly i wanted to find out what the

470
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,680
circumstances were with that house

471
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,360
to see if i could make a lower offer the

472
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,560
house was actually on the market for

473
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,240
9.50

474
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,399
and i want to see if i can offer 500.

475
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,880
turns out the mortgage wasn't duress

476
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,360
right so um it's important to understand

477
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,720
what you're trying to get out of it so

478
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,120
you

479
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,839
know as you go down your path with open

480
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,360
source intelligence

481
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,120
um and you find a bit of interior in

482
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,800
there and you branch off

483
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,920
from that central line i.e away from the

484
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,880
target into

485
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,079
family and friends if it's not taking

486
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,000
you towards that end result

487
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,839
then you kind of will shut down that

488
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,199
branch and come back to

489
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,399
to to your main line

490
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,000
okay and understanding what you might

491
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,040
find

492
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,440
so this can include things of sexual or

493
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,959
graphic nature it can include

494
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,199
violence um you know if you're

495
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,639
investigating

496
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,720
you know underage children

497
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,399
you you have to mentally prepare

498
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,480
yourself for what you might find

499
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,839
typically you're going to find the edgy

500
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,600
stuff on the dark web

501
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,360
i have zero experience working on the

502
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,920
dark web um

503
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,040
but you have to you have to be prepared

504
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,839
for what you might find

505
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,079
um having all these in place

506
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,839
means you know you're pretty much good

507
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,759
to go

508
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,560
you see not like this that's not you

509
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,160
know you think it's complex but it's

510
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,040
actually

511
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,120
you could see how simple it is right and

512
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,439
that is it's open to anyone and part of

513
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,679
this talk in this journey is

514
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,799
getting people that might not be

515
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,199
involved in infosec or even technology

516
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,240
to see how

517
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,039
easy something like this is as as a

518
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,039
start to you know a journey towards

519
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,799
information security okay so what is the

520
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,199
result

521
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,000
okay so this is this is now the the

522
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,520
satisfaction that comes from doing good

523
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
open source intelligence right

524
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,000
okay so the fine so finding that last

525
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,440
loan location

526
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,120
of a missing person and reading an

527
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,559
article knowing that

528
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,160
you were perhaps part of finding that

529
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,640
person there's there's a lot of

530
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,160
good vibes that come from that you know

531
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,840
it's like popping a box on something you

532
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,640
know it

533
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,200
it brings a sense of joy and excitement

534
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,400
and and

535
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,240
satisfaction to you okay so getting that

536
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,840
new client and getting their new job so

537
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,360
you did your research you got to get in

538
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,559
with the company

539
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,400
and you managed to land them that's

540
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,240
always going to be good fives and good

541
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,440
feelings right

542
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,200
um or if you're researching to a company

543
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,360
you impress a company maybe the

544
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,360
president well on the technical side

545
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,280
um quite as much as they expected but

546
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,559
you smash them

547
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,720
knowing so much about their company and

548
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,840
what that company does

549
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,440
okay so when you know you know when you

550
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,000
know

551
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,039
you know when you sharpen your

552
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,360
abilities you know what you're able to

553
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,600
find and what help you can provide

554
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,520
and how to protect yourself your friends

555
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,880
and your family

556
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,200
by having a deeper level level

557
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,960
understanding of how open source

558
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,880
intelligence work and how you take small

559
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,120
piece of information stringing together

560
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,120
equips you better for making better

561
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,200
decisions and helping protect your

562
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,880
family and your friends when posting

563
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,720
stupid stuff on things like facebook and

564
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,960
instagram

565
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,400
there's a there's a there's a sense of

566
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,640
satisfaction in having that

567
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,640
understanding and many pieces

568
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,320
make one pretty puzzle so with open

569
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,320
source intelligence you'll find a bunch

570
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,640
of

571
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,559
small pieces of insignificant

572
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,320
intelligence right

573
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,080
when you get all those small pieces

574
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,520
together you can build an interesting

575
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,360
picture and you can understand

576
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,280
what was going on you know with with

577
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,559
trace labs we'll look at

578
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,200
an underage girl say no she's 16 and be

579
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,320
missing for

580
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,960
400 days you'll look and you'll find her

581
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,720
facebook profile where she's connected

582
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,880
with all her friends and family and

583
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,480
everything looks fine and there's a lot

584
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,400
of smiles a lot of happiness

585
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,000
and then you find their sock account so

586
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,520
they're alternative accounts

587
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,200
sometimes i'll have more than one i've

588
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,720
found people that have 10

589
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,600
alternate facebook accounts and then you

590
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,160
see the

591
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,679
the the the beast within you see the

592
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,840
the drugs you see the gang affiliations

593
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,039
you see the

594
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,520
the the tragic circumstances at the

595
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,400
house

596
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,120
you you you quickly get a better

597
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,960
understanding of what potentially led up

598
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,440
to this

599
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,559
this person going missing or what led to

600
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,919
the situation

601
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,039
so yeah those small pieces of

602
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,200
information they mean nothing but when

603
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,440
you

604
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,520
when you put them all together it it

605
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,200
pulls a fascinating picture

606
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,880
that's all knowledge so the knowledge of

607
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,120
knowing when you have a skill set

608
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,280
you know what you're able to find and

609
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,880
how to achieve something

610
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,080
right it's not with anything in life

611
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,559
when you have that understanding

612
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,159
you you know what you can achieve with

613
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,000
it you know

614
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,200
how you can use that skill set to

615
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,520
uh bring goodness into life or achieve

616
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,720
something in life it's

617
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,320
this there's great value in that

618
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,400
okay so side effects so what what can

619
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,840
you gain indirectly

620
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,000
from having a skills in open source

621
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,640
intelligence

622
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,520
okay so side effects okay so being a

623
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,360
champion of opinions uh

624
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,760
of opsec right operational security or

625
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,480
per se

626
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
personal security right so being a

627
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,240
champion of our operational security and

628
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,200
being

629
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,720
you know the family opsec troll you know

630
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,960
typically people in our industry have a

631
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
very good awareness and understanding

632
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,720
and we tend to be trolls with our

633
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,000
friends and family and say hey

634
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,840
like be careful posting this and this is

635
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,600
why you shouldn't post that and

636
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,200
stop doing those surveys on facebook um

637
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,520
having this understanding will help you

638
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,799
you know

639
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,640
protect your your friends and family

640
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,400
more and you know being like i said

641
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,120
you're the

642
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,158
champion of opsec

643
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,799
okay so the hunger so you had a taste

644
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,640
and you want more due to the ease of

645
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,480
entry of open source intelligence

646
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
and then achieving some success it is

647
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,240
only natural to one more

648
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,559
whether it is more ocean whether it is

649
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,440
more or

650
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,200
more ascent or whether it is just more

651
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,919
challenges right

652
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,400
so from the hunger you might fall into

653
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,320
the the part where you have you build

654
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,080
some form of intent

655
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,240
so once achieving the above one starts

656
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,320
to learn more about security and how to

657
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:48,799
find

658
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,440
other information on hacking right so

659
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,640
although the next step is more

660
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,159
technically challenging the hunger and

661
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:54,960
the intent

662
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,840
is enough to push people into this

663
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,799
direction right so that's what happened

664
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,559
with me when i started

665
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,200
um when i started exploring this

666
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,640
industry more from a personal

667
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,600
perspective

668
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,320
i started with oceans and i loved it and

669
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,919
from ostent i started

670
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,760
looking i started doing cts and i

671
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,120
thought hang on let me try something

672
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,880
else and i did forensics

673
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,760
and i enjoyed that so it's it's that's

674
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,360
why i said it's like a gateway drug it

675
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,400
starts you off down and

676
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,080
done a vicious path

677
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,080
okay so the past so once you've had the

678
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
drug you built the hunger and have the

679
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,880
intent

680
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,200
people tend to build a path in line with

681
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,320
security

682
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,240
right not everyone but some people right

683
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,840
i evolved from open source intelligence

684
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,679
into forensics challenges

685
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,240
uh and from their deputy style ctfs

686
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,720
um and then i got into stego and some

687
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,919
offensive stuff at

688
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,520
obviously an extremely basic level

689
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,559
and at a very slow pace from there you

690
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:56,880
know

691
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,039
formal plans evolve into things like

692
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,720
pain testing re-teaming social

693
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,640
engineering and forensics like i did

694
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,679
with me

695
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,720
right so this can lead down to

696
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,720
you know potentially a changing career

697
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,400
you know you're that i.t person or that

698
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,200
dev

699
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,559
that suddenly had an interest in this

700
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,240
you took a swing at

701
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,240
at trace labs or had some challenges and

702
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,000
you enjoyed what you did there

703
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,559
and then you evolved into something new

704
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,000
so now with with everything

705
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,799
you've learned you have added so uh you

706
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,240
have added many other skills

707
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,200
um and you are doing more technical work

708
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,600
but all the while you're using osint in

709
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,000
its many forms to add value to your new

710
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,679
and evolved career

711
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,880
okay so feed the supply

712
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,000
this will make sense shortly

713
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,799
right so going clean so you know this is

714
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,400
now you know you tried ocean

715
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,679
maybe the trace labs you did some

716
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,360
challenges and you just like well you

717
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,960
know this is dull this is boring

718
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,320
you know if you're an offensive security

719
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,720
specialist it's in probably not going to

720
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,559
be as exciting for you right you prefer

721
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,640
to you know sit behind a come online and

722
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,440
and do all your gucci stuff right but

723
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,640
you know at least there's some stuff you

724
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,520
can take from it

725
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
right so you gave it a shot you tried

726
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,200
and perhaps it's just it's just not for

727
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,679
you

728
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,480
and that's cool right you still gained

729
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,039
you know

730
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,440
no matter how in-depth you went you

731
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,400
still gained

732
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,080
a lot of experience and understanding

733
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,520
and operational security and personal

734
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,480
security

735
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,200
and that's always a value you've gained

736
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,919
a

737
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,679
different level of mindfulness by

738
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,600
understanding the risks and how

739
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,840
information can be strung together you

740
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,799
know it'll help you

741
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,559
be better equipped to make better

742
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,640
decisions related to what you post and

743
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,640
push out on the internet

744
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,480
ideally and you know if not any of that

745
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,919
you can just remember the good old days

746
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,400
you know i if i stop doing ocean now i

747
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,600
would always think about it i was

748
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,360
thinking about that one case

749
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,919
where we found this and we found that i

750
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,520
have some very fond memories from the

751
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,799
recent ctf

752
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,360
we did where we managed to track down

753
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,600
very

754
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
chance tracked on a location of someone

755
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,799
they've been missing for almost a year

756
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,000
and a half

757
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,799
um and you know those those bold

758
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,400
memories and i was like you know get

759
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
your first shell one day you know you

760
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,480
you tend to remember that shout out i

761
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,159
got my first shell thanks to toko that's

762
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:12,840
on on

763
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
axles

764
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,200
okay so you know you you you decided to

765
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,880
continue down your path with icing so

766
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,080
you didn't give up like the previous

767
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,279
slide you decided you know

768
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,840
where else can this go right so you can

769
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,679
go show and tell right tell your friends

770
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:28,000
and tell

771
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,120
your family about what you do and how

772
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,760
it will help them take better care when

773
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,279
they're posting information

774
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,919
right so my missus this talk somehow

775
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,760
inspired her and she's not starting to

776
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,640
learn more about

777
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,120
open intelligence right by telling your

778
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,559
friends and family you not only make

779
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,080
them aware but who knows maybe some of

780
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,679
them might have an interest in doing

781
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,840
this because of its ease of entry

782
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,240
right so keep that in mind right

783
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,480
understanding the entry

784
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,279
is now you know getting involved uh you

785
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,159
know it took a

786
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,799
it took a lot from me to take on an

787
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,120
ocean challenge and hacked the box

788
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,880
which then led me to trace labs which

789
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,360
led me on to more diverse etfs

790
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,080
all this has led me in a direction of a

791
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,159
career change so i hope yes i'm a

792
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,360
recruiting now

793
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,760
but i hope to be a digital forensics

794
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,840
consultant one day or you know do cyber

795
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,279
threat intelligence or something down

796
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,559
that line

797
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,400
right by understanding the ease of entry

798
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,320
you may be more inclined to take your

799
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,120
first shot

800
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,159
or challenge uh a ctf

801
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,080
right so it took me

802
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,440
touching ocean to want to dub my toes

803
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,679
into things like jpd style cts

804
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,960
because everyone else is doing stuff i

805
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,480
smashed all the ocean challenges and i

806
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,679
was like you know what

807
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,440
let's look at forensics and once i sold

808
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,880
one forensics challenge

809
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,120
thanks to google you know i was like you

810
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,720
know i can do forensics and let me let

811
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,480
me learn more about this

812
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,320
let me take it and that's now evolved

813
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,960
into a complete career change

814
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,520
right so the evolution so walk the path

815
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,000
that ocean takes you it might lead you

816
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,080
uh to just being more mindful and more

817
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,320
aware it could lead you down a path into

818
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,840
information security

819
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,320
right so take away and and summary

820
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,120
right get involved with open source

821
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,880
intelligence in whatever form

822
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,000
you're probably doing it already if we

823
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,440
know it's like you know if you

824
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,159
dating online you're always going to try

825
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,120
fine

826
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,640
but inflation to find out if they're

827
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,559
crazy or not right

828
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,480
a lot of us are doing it without being

829
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,120
away um maybe this talk just helps you

830
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,000
label that and

831
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,360
that's fine but you know see where it

832
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,440
takes you and and try it out come

833
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,600
come join us on on hacksaws and do some

834
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,520
challenges on on act the box

835
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,200
come join us for chase labs you know

836

um i know like the vet that's on here he

840
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,360
works in the legal space he has

841
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,480
very little understanding about

842
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,200
information security but

843
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,159
he he had he built an interest in osint

844
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:04,640
and

845
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,799

and the rest of the teammates

848
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,600
with him i've come seventh and and

849
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
seventh and third globally with trace

850
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,480
lab so don't be

851
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,399
don't be adverse to to to walking down

852
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,959
that path

853
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,039
right if you're scared remind yourself

854
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,360
of the ease of entry and take a swing

855
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,200
so this talk might necessarily be that

856
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,480
well catered to

857
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,559
you know advanced offset or offensive

858
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,760
security people

859
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,039
but it's there to help inspire everyone

860
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,679
and and and have a try at it like we try

861
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:38,880
other challenges

862
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,120
on a ctf that we have no understanding

863
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,640
of right it's

864
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,840
it's it's it's a new skill to learn okay

865
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,799
remember the rule

866
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,360
uh the rules of engagement remember zero

867
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,159
touch

868
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,840
try use stock accounts or alternative

869
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,760
accounts um

870
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,120
use a vpn uh try stay as as secure as

871
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,000
you can and be

872
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,520
mindful of that which you might find

873
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,320
along the path

874
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,320
as i said earlier tell your friends tell

875
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,520
your family and tell your colleagues

876
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,600
about open source intelligence

877
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,919
some people love it it's good sometimes

878
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,039
that are bright it's pretty good

879
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,440
conversation starter in showing people

880
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,720
what you can find with them you know

881
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,880
doing a typical thing like asking

882
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,640
someone's email address or scratching

883
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,000
around trying to find the emojis you

884
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,279
find the email address

885
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,120
you put in have i been phoned and then

886
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,559
you explain to them you know

887
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,000
what it means when the email address has

888
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,679
been in like four different breaches

889
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:28,559
which is something i

890
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,320
i had recently happened at a bride um

891
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,000
taking all that can show people how

892
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,440
vulnerable they are and will make them

893
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,559
more mindful

894
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,320
and also might interest them and you

895
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,000
know what better way to defend

896
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,960
yourself and then up skill and and and

897
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,760
learn from the best

898
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,840
okay follow the path that ocean takes

899
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,279
you whether

900
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,960
whether it takes you down just a simple

901
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,399
doing the ctf side

902
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:53,840
or whether it takes you on a path into

903
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,760
information security

904
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,520
see where it takes you and and and

905
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,320
follow that road

906
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,279
right if you like it keep learning and

907
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,880
evolve your skills

908
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,600
i i am very good at basic oceans i don't

909
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,080
use

910
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,039
any tools really um you know and that's

911
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,559
this kind of thing is like a vm and

912
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,919
stock accounts

913
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,279
there's a lot of good tools out there

914
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,039
and that's what i plan to use to sharpen

915
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,159
my skills

916
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,559
but it's pretty straightforward stuff

917
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,080
you just gotta understand what to look

918
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,720
at

919
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,080
and what pause to walk down right and

920
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,559
if you if you evolve with that you can

921
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,320
get better and you can evolve into other

922
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,879
new things

923
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,840
yeah and i'll say yeah learn new things

924
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,039
so

925
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,679
i am trying to work i am i'm not very

926
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,559
good at geospatial intelligence so

927
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,200
finding places on a map i'm really bad

928
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,840
at that

929
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,919
um but i'm trying to work on that so one

930
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,360
thing i'm focusing on now

931
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,279
is getting better at triangulating where

932
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,120
a photo is taken

933
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,039
and trying to identify where a location

934
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,240
is purely based on

935
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,679
a photo so yeah learn new things and

936
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,080
this is typical of of this industry

937
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,080
we're always required to learn learn fun

938
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,200
and interesting

939
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,880
new things my links attributions are the

940
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,159
only thing i took idea was from

941
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,480
wikipedia and obviously there's a lot of

942
