1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,719
so what kind of mark do you want to

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,080
leave behind

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,480
i've got a story that might inspire you

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,480
it starts 40 000 years ago

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,359
in a cave inside a mountain in the

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,800
northern part of spain called

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,119
el castillo and if you look at the roof

8
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,720
of this cave and you look a little bit

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,320
closer you'll see some

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,960
marks up there some artworks and it

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,800
might surprise many of you to realize

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,320
that scientists are now beginning to

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,880
agree that this specific piece of art

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,440
was not created by humans that's right

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,120
look again count the fingers

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,600
and it's not your thinking these were

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,480
created by

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,800
neanderthals or neanderthals to use the

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,719
correct pronunciation

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,200
and neanderthals went extinguish about

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,719
40 000 years ago

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,239
but notice how different they are to us

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,160
look how much bigger their brains were

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,640
like us and if you could entertain me

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,320
for a moment if we wanted to write

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,680
nick bolstrom's ancestor simulation and

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,040
imagine we did this in java

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,040
we would create an abstract class called

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,760
homo hydrogenesis genesis

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,000
notice that the genes are private and we

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,920
would then extend that class

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,040
to create a neanderthal same thing for

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,080
homo sapiens

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,080
and our uml diagram would look something

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,920
like this and then 500

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,040
000 years later we'd add on homo sapiens

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,799
so the two are quite different in that

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,240
if we created an instance of a

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,119
neanderthal an instance of a human being

40
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,600
neanderthal does not equal human being

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,000
nor does human being

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,840
equal neanderthal but they were a

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,600
separate and intelligent species that

44
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,439
lived on earth many thousands of years

45
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:45,840
ago

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,040
and interesting and related side fact

47
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,360
humans could shag neanderthals and this

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,600
did in fact happen which leads me to my

49
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,640
theory around where

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,640
these handprints got onto that cave wall

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,240
in the first place

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,439
but back to the points

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,920
neanderthals implement a make mock

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,360
interface as well

55
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,520
and so do we and this is what it looked

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,720
like from neanderthals

57
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,280
and we have our own versions of that so

58
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,800
back in the present day

59
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
i'd like to ask you how you want to

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,840
implement your

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,280
make mark interface this is a completely

62
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,000
different type

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,400
of cave painting it's called the pioneer

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,280
plaque

65
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,160
attached to the pioneer probes 10 and 11

66
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,239
and while these are being constructed

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,720
pay attention to where that dish is

68
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,400
being mounted on those struts

69
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,640
and if you had to peer between those

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,239
that's where you'd find the pioneer

71
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:38,959
block

72
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,400
it's funny to me that they're actually

73
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,480
pointed facing inward and not

74
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,879
outward but anyway these were the first

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,760
probes that

76
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,800
uh that humans sent outside of our solar

77
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,280
system

78
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,200
past the orbit of mars and past the

79
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,480
asteroid belt

80
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,480
and jupiter was one of the first planets

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,319
that pioneer 10 visited

82
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,800
showing us a photograph like this which

83
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,319
maybe a story for another day

84
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,040
wasn't actually taken with a camera but

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,440
it's a misconception that pioneers 1011

86
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,080
used an

87
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,879
intel 404 chip they actually had custom

88
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,239
ttl logic

89
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,959
and uh that custom ttl logic could only

90
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,959
handle about 200 instructions with

91
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,159
memory to

92
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,080
handle about 500 pounds that could be

93
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,120
sent from earth with approximately 40 k

94
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,319
or 50k um worth of memory so a very

95
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,640
interesting mark that was left there

96
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,959
later on uh these were sent out you

97
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,400
might recognize these as the golden

98
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,120
records used on voyagers 1 and 2

99
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,720
in 1972 and this is from nasa's jpl

100
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,760
website

101
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,760
it's a very cool 3d model that you can

102
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,280
interact with and it shows you exactly

103
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,640
where they're mounted

104
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,120
on these probes so you can see exactly

105
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,000
where they are

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,319
a little bit bigger than normal records

107
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,920
um but if you wanted to play one of

108
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,599
these fortunately the instructions

109
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,480
are on the cover on the front so for

110
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,640
anyone or anything encountering these

111
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,200
they'd first need to understand um that

112
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
there's a property of hydrogen where the

113
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,680
state of the spin moments between the

114
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,280
proton the electron

115
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,200
changes and this can be used as a

116
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,640
universal clock

117
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,120
um if you match that up to give you the

118
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,120
rate of rotation at which you should

119
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,879
create your own record player to play

120
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,399
this with you can

121
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,639
then be able to pick up the signals off

122
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,478
that record and compose an image and

123
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,240
notice that calibration image that

124
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,040
circle

125
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
down in the bottom this is what it would

126
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,199
look like or sound like if someone had

127
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,639
to actually play

128
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,360
that record and there you've got that

129
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,880
calibration image coming in

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,240
very interesting stuff and here's an

131
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,840
image of

132
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,840
our galaxy and what it looks like

133
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,600
this is what our number system looks

134
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,840
like and it carries on like this with

135
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,600
pictures of various things from all over

136
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,479
the planet

137
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,240
a lot of it is copywritten so i can't

138
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,600
show you a lot of it

139
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,720
and as usual there's always some

140
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
human genitalia attached to many of

141
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,759
these things that's why

142
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,360
i'm bogged by this conference's

143
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,039
ethics and rules to be able to show you

144
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,800
the rest but there are also other

145
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,320
interesting things like how we

146
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,080
communicate with radio telescopes and i

147
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,199
especially love this picture of the

148
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,320
arecibo

149
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,479
telescope here's a nice view of it from

150
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,160
above because when this was

151
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,120
um inaugurated in the 1970s they sent

152
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,560
out this very famous

153
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,039
arecibo message and i raised the sony

154
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,160
because this um

155
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,479
had a fun little joke reply that came

156
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,240
back called the arecibo reply

157
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,080
which i thought was pretty funny but

158
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,000
anyway the voyager probes also had their

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,600
own type of computer they had three in

160
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,240
fact

161
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,880
uh the main one being a command um

162
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,639
control computer system

163
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,840
and this is what uplinked and managed

164
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,280
all the procedures between all other

165
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,479
types of computers

166
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,639
again this was custom ttl logic running

167
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,639
at two megahertz but it had about 64

168
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,600
kilobytes

169
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,880
of ram and approximately 64 megabytes of

170
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,639
storage and this is what the ccs looked

171
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,000
like from the outside

172
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,680
some black and white photo curves from

173
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,680
the inside and it was actually

174
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,680
dual-cored at two processors notice

175
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,400
processor a

176
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,199
and processor b and uh notice as well

177
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,000
that it wasn't

178
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,080
actually any type of flash storage but

179
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,400
actually tape it had a thousand feet of

180
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,199
eight-track

181
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,680
tape that it used to store images and

182
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,600
other data that it would later on relay

183
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,560
back to earth

184
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,919
in a very slow connection of 168 votes

185
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,360
per second going up

186
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,639
and 72k coming down

187
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,120
now the probe was programmed in a custom

188
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,639
sort of assembly language

189
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,120
that used 18-bit words with 6-bit

190
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,680
opt-code and 12-bit addresses

191
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,759
there were only 13 registers in total

192
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,759
and some of the software

193
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,280
for higher level functions was written

194
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,199
in fortran and later on

195
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,319
ported over to c

196
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,600
so of course we're not talking about

197
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,240
doom 2016 or doom eternal

198
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,080
and we're not talking about doom 3

199
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,400
either we're talking about the original

200
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,560
doom from 1993

201
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,840
and i'm sure a lot of you guys are

202
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,400
asking yourselves but why

203
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,919
and that's because doom really is

204
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,759
special because doom was

205
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,080
impossible if you think of the best

206
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,599
computer hardware you could buy for

207
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,039
yourself at the time

208
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,919
this is an example of a onyx by silicon

209
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,520
graphics that could cost you anywhere

210
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,319
between 100 and 200 thousand dollars and

211
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,960
in 1995 a computer like that was used to

212
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,440
develop

213
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,039
toy story the movie which required 117

214
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,400
sun microsystem computers in racks like

215
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:26,880
this

216
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,319
800 or 800 000 machine hours

217
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,360
um to render 114 000 frames of animation

218
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,199
that all looked like this

219
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,360
compare that to what toy story 4 looked

220
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,800
like last year

221
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,639
and look at the detail on that you

222
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,160
really do get a sense of why

223
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,960
at the time doom really was before its

224
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,560
time in pretty much every

225
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,680
possible way so i mean

226
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,919
if you think about what doom looks like

227
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,520
and what she could get two years before

228
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,199
toy story even came out

229
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,120
in real time on a computer that wasn't

230
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,400
even designed to produce

231
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,720
3d graphics like this it really is

232
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,080
amazing i mean consider

233
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,960
you could run this on or at an absolute

234
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,160
absolute minimum

235
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,360
an intel 386 clocked at 33 megahertz and

236
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,759
only four megabytes of ram

237
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,360
there was no need for a graphics card

238
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,879
they didn't even exist not even in their

239
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,720
first versions that's what

240
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,560
things like quake ended up encouraging

241
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
in the market for most people this is

242
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,080
what computers looked like

243
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,240
and this is what microsoft word looked

244
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,879
like so way back in february

245
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,479
or 1992 uh some of the first doom alphas

246
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,159
were released so some of you may never

247
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,120
have seen these

248
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,799
uh this is what the main menu looked

249
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,159
like there's this weird

250
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,799
heads-up display this is this kind of um

251
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,000
space marine

252
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,240
base and a weird bayonet attached to the

253
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,760
front of this gun

254
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,880
and um on the 10th of december 1983 on

255
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,480
our software creations bbs

256
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,160
2.39 megabytes of data was uploaded to a

257
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,680
university of

258
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,240
wisconsin madison server and it's a myth

259
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,000
that the server actually crashed

260
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,360
what really happened is that so many

261
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,120
people were expecting doom that it had

262
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,920
filled up

263
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,080
the entire connection pool for the ftp

264
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,720
server and now to phone the admin up

265
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
to go and restart the server so that the

266
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,080
guys that it could actually get a

267
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,720
connection

268
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,200
upload do but after that happened

269
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,240
everyone

270
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,519
started playing doom and it was a major

271
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,760
success it started earning its software

272
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,440
100 000 dollars a month um john carmack

273
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,040
and john romero both bought themselves

274
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
matching ferraris and multiplayer became

275
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,440
this

276
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,680
huge thing although back then the term

277
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,519
death match was of course coined

278
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,600
and this was the death match manager and

279
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,120
i remember using this with a serial

280
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,760
cable

281
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,839
to connect my computer to family members

282
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,800
or to friends

283
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,600
to play deathmatch games which i spent

284
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,080
way

285
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,480
too much time doing and at least things

286
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,240
didn't get too much out of control but

287
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,920
there were articles like this and things

288
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,519
like pc magazine

289
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,519
where doom took over my life makes one

290
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,519
think of world of warcraft actually

291
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,279
but it's absolutely true that doom was

292
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,880
banned in places like intel

293
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,440
later software and many universities and

294
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,920
by 1995 there were over 10

295
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,720
million installations of doom meaning

296
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,200
that

297
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,800
there were more installations of doom

298
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,519
than they were of windows 95

299
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,880
which was one of the things that

300
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,560
prompted bill gates to make this very

301
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,079
strange promotional video

302
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,480
promoting doom 95 which was meant in

303
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,279
turn to promote windows 95 as a gaming

304
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,800
platform

305
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,360
but of course it runs doom became this

306
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,680
massive phenomenon and i love this comic

307
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,279
where this computer scientist is talking

308
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,959
about this alien computer

309
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,399
that has an architecture entirely

310
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,480
foreign to ours we have much to learn

311
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,200
from it

312
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,760
and we may have much to fear and the

313
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,360
computer science is saying

314
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,760
bam i've got doom running on this thing

315
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,680
and this trend is so much fun this is

316
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,360
doom running on an ipad

317
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,440
doom running on a canon printer doom

318
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,040
running on an apple watch but don't

319
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,279
worry android fans we've got you covered

320
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,200
doom running on the touch bar of a

321
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,360
macbook pro doom on a kodak digital

322
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,600
camera doom on a psp doom on an atm

323
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,279
machine doom on an oscilloscope

324
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,560
doom on a barcode reader

325
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,880
doom on the entertainment system of a

326
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,600
porsche 911 turbo and doom on a toaster

327
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,000
i think those last two were probably

328
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,839
fake but are you convinced that there

329
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,240
must be something about this software

330
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,760
that makes it easy to port and and

331
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,000
just something worth looking into and

332
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,760
something worth learning about

333
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,680
and this is why i'm proposing that do

334
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,920
might just be the ideal candidate

335
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,279
to leave on a rover like curiosities

336
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,399
especially because

337
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,800
the story of doom starts on mars and

338
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,320
it's probably also

339
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,560
as much of a cultural artifact of how we

340
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,160
got to this point over the last couple

341
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,279
of decades

342
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,320
than anything else

343
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,079
so at this point it's probably a good

344
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,519
idea to introduce some reference

345
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,120
material and a lot of what i'll be

346
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,880
talking about today is based on

347
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,120
two books first the game engine black

348
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,760
book for doom by fabian sanglad

349
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,360
and this goes into a lot of the detail

350
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,519
around how the code was put together

351
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,000
and how various different parts of the

352
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,200
game engine worked

353
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,800
so that's really really recommended and

354
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,560
if you're interested in other titles by

355
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,360
fabian

356
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,560
like his books on doom 3 or quake i'd

357
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,160
highly highly recommend those

358
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,760
but i've used this extensively as

359
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,440
reference for um what i'm going to be

360
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,959
chatting about today

361
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,639
and then from a more cultural story

362
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,560
about how doom came about masters of

363
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,160
doom by david kushner

364
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,480
is a very very good read and by the way

365
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,240
if you do grab the audiobook version of

366
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,720
this

367
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,639
it is read by none other than um

368
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,000
wesley crusher so who made doom

369
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,240
its software were these guys who

370
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,079
actually started working in this lake

371
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:34,399
house

372
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,839
first developing commander keane and

373
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,440
then moving on through other titles like

374
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,079
wolfenstein

375
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,079
and doom and the two main characters

376
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,680
we'll read about in the story

377
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,000
are both john romero and john carmack

378
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,680
neither of whom came from

379
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,519
you know wealthy families with grand

380
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,720
houses

381
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,800
they actually came from broken homes and

382
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
didn't have fancy educations

383
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,120
but looking at john romero he was the

384
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,160
principal

385
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
artistic influence on the game i suppose

386
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,760
and a lot of the development

387
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,959
around the um level editors and and

388
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,040
level designs and those kinds of things

389
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
where john carmack was really the brains

390
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,880
behind the development of the

391
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
engine that random so he was developer

392
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,360
squared and created the 3d engine

393
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,480
and really wasn't shy in using a lot of

394
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,839
reference material

395
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,320
and academic papers to get the maths

396
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,160
right behind what he wanted his engine

397
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,079
to be able to do

398
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,279
so 1983 the nintendo nes came out which

399
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,240
by the way can

400
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,639
also run doom if you make some very

401
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,399
serious modifications to one of the

402
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,360
cartridges

403
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,639
and put raspberry pi in it but the nes

404
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,240
was most popular for running games like

405
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,040
mario

406
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,639
i just want you to notice how the

407
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,240
background can move

408
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,399
as mario moves here that was something

409
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,399
quite unique to consoles at the time and

410
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,240
even seven years later

411
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,760
in 1990 um the pc for example

412
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,920
running a game like prince of persia

413
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,120
just noticed how

414
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,199
while prince of persia was fun you

415
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,240
probably never noticed that the

416
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,959
background

417
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,959
never moved because it was very

418
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,560
expensive for

419
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,279
a pc to redraw the background every

420
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,399
single time

421
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,920
and that's why they looked like this and

422
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,639
why most pc games looked like this

423
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,160
but enter on the pc commander keen

424
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,600
in this in 1990 and um

425
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,839
there's a vga version of it and if you

426
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,279
play this game

427
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,199
and start a new game this is what it

428
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,040
looked like and notice we have

429
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,800
a moving background and you need to

430
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,240
understand that this was quite

431
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,959
revolutionary for the time no other pc

432
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,160
games could do anything

433
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,399
like this and this is what eid software

434
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,000
was able to do

435
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,360
but how did it work well um if you take

436
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,600
your normal screen resolution for pc at

437
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,720
the time you only had 320 by 200

438
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,199
pixels to deal with and every time use a

439
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,560
programmer wanted to write a piece

440
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,000
software that would

441
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,360
render a game like this you needed to

442
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,120
render the entire screen

443
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,279
put it in vram for it to go out to the

444
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,240
display and then for

445
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,199
every frame you'd have to redraw the

446
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,279
whole screen pop it in vram

447
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,600
same thing you get the idea this is not

448
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,199
terribly efficient and why it generally

449
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,480
wasn't done

450
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,760
enter adaptive tile refresh which was a

451
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,800
vram hack an ega ega-based vram hack

452
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,720
where you'd put the whole image into

453
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,120
vram and then just reference it by its

454
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,680
xy

455
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,839
coordinates to be able to move it around

456
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:20,959
on screen

457
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,680
as follows and thus you could get this

458
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,480
kind

459
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,160
of gameplay so by 1992

460
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,440
wolfenstein 3d comes in

461
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,199
and uh here's just a little bit of video

462
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,480
of how this thing

463
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,120
looked i love that get psych thing let's

464
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,720
start a new game there

465
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,360
bring it on love that loading screen

466
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,120
and you'll see a lot of common elements

467
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,720
um with doom

468
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,399
what doom look like but also want you to

469
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,160
notice besides how

470
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,560
sort of pixelated everything looks here

471
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,440
that

472
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,800
wolfenstein only has walls in its

473
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,000
environments that have

474
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,519
90 degrees you don't get any other um

475
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,040
kind of things which is why this looked

476
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,880
like such a maze game

477
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,320
and well anyway we can just carry on um

478
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,720
how did this work though well it used

479
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,480
something called ray tracing where we

480
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,120
literally cast array from the player's

481
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,160
perspective

482
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,959
and measure the length of that ray and

483
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,639
if you looked at that from the player's

484
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,600
perspective

485
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
it would use the length of that ray to

486
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,800
draw a series of

487
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,959
columns with a height changing depending

488
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,639
on how far away

489
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,320
the ray came and well it also came with

490
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,519
the advantage of you

491
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,120
only needing to draw that which the

492
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,199
player could see from their perspective

493
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,519
and this is what was called ray casting

494
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,279
not to be confused with ray tracing

495
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,800
that's what you need one of these for

496
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,800
certain source code was released at

497
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,040
public in 1997

498
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
and uh for those of you guys who still

499
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,360
play doom on dos if you had to ever

500
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
dure out that directory and see what's

501
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,800
in there you'd notice that

502
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,160
the biggest files were always the

503
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,079
executable and the wad

504
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,519
file now the wad file would be quite big

505
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,000
it would make

506
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,240
up almost 90 percent of the entire game

507
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,679
and what of course stood for

508
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,240
where's all the data and if it had to

509
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,599
break open one of these

510
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,280
you'd find that only about half of it

511
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,359
was graphics um

512
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,280
yeah ten percent of it would be sound a

513
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,480
little bit of

514
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,039
sound effects and a lot of it almost 30

515
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:21,520
would be

516
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,959
map data and um if you looked at the

517
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,280
wod compared to the actual source code

518
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,240
that was released

519
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,679
the source code that was released was

520
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,240
only for um

521
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
the game engine itself and not the

522
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,760
actual wad file meaning that you still

523
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,799
need to pay

524
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,480
and get the wad file to use with any

525
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,120
open

526
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,880
source solution that you created around

527
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,400
that so

528
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,919
without any further ado let's take a

529
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,440
look at the

530
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,400
source code itself so the source tree

531
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,559
starts with doom v1 which was initially

532
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,640
released in 1993

533
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,280
and then it was version two from which

534
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,840
um

535
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,799
things like hypertech and hexson and all

536
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,400
those games were created by raven

537
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,280
software

538
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,520
and then doom carried up on up until

539
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,400
doom

540
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,760
two you've gotta love the versioning

541
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
number over there and

542
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,480
then doom two got a patch ultimate doom

543
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,360
was created

544
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,559
final doom doom 95 you saw that thing

545
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,679
with bill gates

546
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,080
and then linux doom and linux doom is

547
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,640
unfortunately the only version of this

548
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,679
for which we have the source code

549
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,799
why you ask well it's because of dmx not

550
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,360
this dmx but because of dmx lib by a

551
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,000
company called digital expressions

552
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
now paul reddick at the time just said

553
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,160
sorry but that's the way it's got to be

554
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,120
and john carmack described it using the

555
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,160
dmx

556
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,039
sound library as a mistake but john

557
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,280
romero was more vocal calling the guy a

558
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,520
 and a sound code dork

559
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,440
but anyway now we've got the source code

560
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,720
up on github and

561
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,400
you guys all know how to go and pull

562
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,559
stuff off that but if you do grab the

563
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,080
source code and check it out

564
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,600
you'll see this map that's quite

565
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,760
useful it shows you where all the video

566
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,240
system files are sound system

567
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,720
networking the renderer etc and if you

568
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,640
use visual studio code to explore this

569
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,600
you'll notice that this

570
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,160
is written in c so there's a make file

571
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
using gcc which you'll use to compile

572
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,880
this

573
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,080
and um yeah i always like to go to the

574
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,799
main

575
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,400
entry point of any program that i'm

576
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,000
going to look at to see how it all works

577
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,520
and interesting how you can see

578
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,200
all the different parameter options that

579
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,880
you might not have seen over there

580
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,520
things like um no monsters fast monsters

581
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,160
death match

582
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,240
ult death interesting things over there

583
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,760
and of course this is what it would have

584
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,039
looked like if you were studying the

585
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,960
code or what it probably looked like

586
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,600
um for not the original developers they

587
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,440
use next step systems what it might have

588
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,000
looked like

589
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,440
in something like borland um but anyway

590
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,760
yeah if you try to compile this

591
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,000
you'd probably have an issue building it

592
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,200
um because

593
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
modern compiler's all 64 but you'll need

594
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,960
to do a lot of configuration

595
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,760
to get the make file to do a 32-bit

596
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,039
compilation for you

597
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,760
but one way to get exactly the same

598
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,200
experience as what you would have had

599
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,559
back in those days

600
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,120
was to use red hat now i do know red hat

601
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,960
is a sponsor of this conference

602
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
but um they're not paying me to say this

603
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,559
at all and you'll you'll see why in a

604
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,360
moment

605
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,760
so i'm looking at a copy of red hat from

606
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,880
2000

607
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,600
specifically version 6.2 called suit

608
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,000
that

609
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,159
i ran in a vm to get this going

610
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,520
and i wonder how many of you have

611
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,919
noticed the netscape navigator icon down

612
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:30,960
at the bottom there

613
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,640
but anyway if i wanted to compile this i

614
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,640
would open up a new terminal

615
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,159
if we zoom in just a little bit over

616
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,400
there this is the process you'd go

617
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,080
through so there's all my source code

618
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,960
over there

619
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,159
and i would just need to create a linux

620
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,559
directory and in that i've put a doom to

621
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,919
what file which is what i'm going to

622
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,919
need and then when i press

623
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,440
make or rather type make i'm going to

624
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,280
see the following output and this is

625
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,120
that makefile busy building up our

626
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,240
version of doom

627
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,000
which we've now compiled so if we go

628
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,440
check back in our linux directory

629
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,200
there's all our o files

630
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,480
and our linux doom copy so if we get

631
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,120
that running

632
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,960
that's doom starting up that should look

633
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,159
familiar to you

634
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,039
and there it is it does mess up the the

635
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,559
graphics of the session but the

636
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,640
graphics of the game itself are

637
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,400
perfectly fine

638
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,159
and it plays perfectly fine too

639
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,679
so i can just start a new game over

640
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:30,240
there and there we go

641
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,760
so let's chat a little bit about how

642
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,000
doom works inside specifically binary

643
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,440
space partitioning which you might have

644
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,559
heard of before

645
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,400
so you might recognize this map this is

646
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,799
e1 m1 from the original doom

647
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,799
and if you considered the entire map as

648
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,400
say root node

649
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,120
a in your tree you would then take your

650
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,799
map and cut the whole thing in half and

651
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:49,840
partition it into

652
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,559
two thus leaving one side on the left

653
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,760
and one side of the right

654
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,679
and those would become a and b in your

655
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,039
tree and you'd then

656
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,320
go and partition side b and

657
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,440
create c and d in exactly the same way

658
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,880
and you do this until you've gotten the

659
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,880
entire map partitioned this way

660
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,360
in small manageable segments that you

661
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,240
can search through very easily in a tree

662
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,320
now if you've never used flame grass

663
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
before i'd very much recommend this for

664
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,159
any type of code profiling that you want

665
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:18,799
to do

666
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,120
but notice how with the main loop down

667
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,720
at the bottom and do main that we saw

668
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,360
before

669
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,600
it calls display and then render player

670
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,440
view and then draw planes

671
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,360
and then render bsp node and it does

672
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,440
this 30 times a second this is why

673
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,280
doom's frame rate is fixed

674
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,120
at 30 times per second so if we're going

675
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,640
to parse

676
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,600
this or traverse these psp trees we

677
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,240
would go

678
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,240
to point on inside which is one of the

679
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,600
parts of the code notice at the bottom

680
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,159
there

681
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,080
that we are busy we've got a left and a

682
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,919
right side of these fixed

683
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,840
t objects which are essentially the

684
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,280
nodes in our tree

685
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,440
which would later on call render player

686
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,720
view

687
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,480
which would then call display and if you

688
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,240
scroll down there a little bit later

689
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,880
you'll see there's render pair view the

690
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,600
hu drawer that's your heads-up display

691
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,760
and full background screen and how this

692
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,600
would actually work

693
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,919
in practice if you imagine you know a

694
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:10,960
player's position

695
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,880
and a player view that we need to render

696
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,320
we would have a segment that we'd need

697
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,159
to draw which would have its own x

698
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,640
y coordinates for the two sides of that

699
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,440
segment

700
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
and on the screen we would use the same

701
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,280
ray casting technique to determine the

702
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,000
height

703
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,919
of the columns of those two pieces and

704
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,039
then we do some

705
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,280
calculations to create a view angle box

706
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,559
to be able to determine what that

707
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,400
segment should look like

708
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,480
so if we had to move around inside a map

709
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,480
like this and then stop

710
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,159
this is what the actual rendering would

711
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,000
look like and notice how

712
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,360
it's rendering the things that are

713
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,919
closest to us first because it's not

714
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,400
going to waste any cpu or processing

715
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,120
power

716
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,200
rendering anything that's further away

717
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,480
and then it renders stuff in the

718
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,520
background

719
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,039
and this is going to be the draw planes

720
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,200
method that's drawing those bottom

721
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,400
um like the floor ceiling

722
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,840
well there's no seating in this scene at

723
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,919
least you can see it draw everything up

724
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:02,640
there

725
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,440
so so that would all happen 30 times a

726
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,400
second

727
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,640
and this would be the render player view

728
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,400
that's doing all of this

729
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,799
and view draw planes uh plane drawing is

730
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,080
also a little bit interesting

731
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,679
see it's just another view of the same

732
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,200
thing happening but

733
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,880
um yeah let's give this a second

734
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,159
just around a little bit i should have

735
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,480
sped this up i'm sorry

736
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,919
but there are the planes being rendered

737
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,200
as well and it's interesting how it does

738
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,679
them as

739
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,120
as triangles in some cases

740
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,120
and again everything you're seeing here

741
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,000
is slowing down

742
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,720
and this would be drawn 30 times a

743
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,240
second

744
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,919
oh and speaking ahead of its time this

745
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,080
is really interesting it only works with

746
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,919
doom version 1.2

747
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,679
but if you've got three computers all

748
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,159
networked together either via modem or

749
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,600
preferably a serial cable in this

750
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,840
example here's an example of this being

751
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,320
done

752
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,360
in um not virtualbox

753
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,799
um dosbox actually is where

754
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,039
you would be able to play the game with

755
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,799
three screens networked together but it

756
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,200
would show you the left and right angles

757
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,440
and this is something john carmack did

758
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,279
so very impressive for his time if you

759
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,080
consider that this

760
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,400
is 1993 1994

761
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,640
immersive virtual reality was close to

762
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,840
it as you could get

763
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,760
so it's actually no wonder that john

764
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,600
carmack ended up at oculus

765
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,400
working in 3d immersion and those kinds

766
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,799
of things

767
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,240
so in 1997 the pathfinder mission

768
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,200
spent about nine months getting to mars

769
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,600
and

770
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,320
gets into the atmosphere fire some retro

771
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,200
rockets

772
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,159
lands on a balloon airbag based system

773
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,440
and becomes the first functioning rover

774
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,559
to work on mars so this is what the

775
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,679
lander looked like there's some

776
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,440
stereoscopic cameras that gave some

777
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,080
really great

778
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,720
panoramas and the rover itself was

779
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,039
called sojourner

780
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,200
and would travel around and look at

781
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,960
rocks and takes

782
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,360
little samples with a spectrograph but

783
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,120
we want to know what kind

784
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,600
of cpu this thing ran so let's take a

785
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,799
look inside

786
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,200
this is all of the rover circuitry and

787
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,400
if we zoom in

788
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,480
that is what the cpu looked like and

789
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,000
it's a atc

790
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,400
85 similar to commercial models that

791
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,600
would look like this

792
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,880
inside and popular in things like the

793
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,760
ibm data master from the 1970s

794
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,640
or the ibm pc xt which some of you might

795
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,440
remember

796
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
from the early 1980s that ran the very

797
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,960
popular intel

798
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,840
8088 chip and looked like this but the

799
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,480
adc85

800
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,200
um ran at only two megahertz it had only

801
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,600
about

802
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,159
70k of ram and 512 kilobytes of storage

803
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,400
and the rover would communicate back um

804
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,480
with a kind of walkie-talkie system

805
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,240
equivalent to a 9600 board modem

806
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,000
that after error correction only really

807
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,200
worked at an effective 2400 board

808
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,880
so the rover could in fact only

809
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,640
communicate back to earth in bursts of

810
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,200
about two kilobytes up and two kilobytes

811
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,919
back

812
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,320
sending photographs like this one but

813
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,760
what kind of operating system did this

814
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,400
thing run

815
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,600
was it pc dos that was popular in the

816
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,039
early 80s

817
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,799
or maybe ms-dos no it had no operating

818
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,520
system at all

819
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,480
use something called a cyclic executive

820
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,240
which in code is very much

821
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,159
just an infinite loop it's an

822
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,679
alternative to a real-time operating

823
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,120
system and this is how

824
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,720
all of the rover's functions were

825
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,960
implemented in c

826
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,840
but does it run doom well i'm afraid not

827
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,679
we just don't have enough mips

828
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,559
for this thing to uh to run doom

829
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,360
so in 2004 considering the same year

830
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,600
that doom 3 came out

831
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,679
a new pair of rovers end up with mars

832
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,399
the mars exploration rover or sometimes

833
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:57,360
called mural

834
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,440
merce because there were two of them and

835
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,120
these things landed in a very similar

836
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,960
style using retro rockets

837
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,120
and airbags to bounce around on the

838
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,000
surface

839
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,559
and this is how spirit and opportunity

840
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,440
became

841
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,480
the new rovers on mars but of course

842
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,919
you've probably watched a lot of

843
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,520
documentaries and know a lot about these

844
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,240
rovers

845
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,760
but you probably don't know what's

846
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,919
running inside so let's take a look

847
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,520
inside and if you were to disassemble

848
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,480
one of them

849
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,679
you could draw out this pcb card and

850
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,960
what you'd want to be looking for in the

851
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,399
top corner over there

852
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,600
is its main cpu and that is of course

853
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,960
the bae systems rad 6000

854
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,200
and it's part of the power 600 micro

855
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,480
architecture so

856
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,640
this is basically the radiation version

857
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,399
of the radiation hardened version

858
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,240
called the rad 6000 and then there was

859
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,919
also a much earlier version

860
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,360
the ibm power pc 601

861
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,559
from 1992 so for many many years before

862
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,640
and this cpu was actually quite

863
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,000
popularly used

864
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,919
by apple in its first series of power

865
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,440
macintosh computers

866
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,559
the 8100 and that cpu being clocked at

867
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,360
80

868
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,039
megahertz in 1993. so the rover had a

869
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,360
rad 6000 uh down clock a little bit to

870
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,240
20 megahertz 128 megabytes of ram

871
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,440
and 256 kilobytes of storage and the

872
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,120
rover could communicate back to earth

873
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,320
either directly

874
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,360
at sometimes as low as 500 bytes per

875
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,159
second

876
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,520
um or use a satellite and go up to 256

877
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,760
bytes per second but what's interesting

878
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,520
is the operating system which is a

879
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,440
real-time operating system

880
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,159
uh by a company called vxworks here's

881
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,480
just an example of what vx works 7 one

882
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,919
of the later versions looks like

883
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:38,880
starting up

884
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,279
and vxworks is being a real-time

885
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,399
operating system

886
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,799
doesn't work on processes but more this

887
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,080
concept of tasks

888
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,440
but we'll definitely get into that a

889
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
little bit later and it's just

890
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,279
fun to note that all of the rover's

891
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,960
control software was written both

892
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,960
in c and c plus but in 2009

893
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,279
the spirit rover was driving up at dune

894
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,320
and sadly got

895
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,600
stuck and by 2010 it was game over

896
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,120
but i have always thought that might

897
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,880
have been an opportunity to upload some

898
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,480
interesting stuff into that rover's

899
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,360
memory

900
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,799
before it was lost and sadly in 2018 the

901
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,440
servers of

902
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,760
mars was covered in a dust storm and we

903
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,080
lost the opportunity rover as well

904
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,559
and as sad as this is i do love and

905
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,080
snicker at this tattoo

906
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,559
with a sort of poeticized version of the

907
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,960
last message that came from the rover

908
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,440
um but notice that that is not the

909
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,120
opportunity rover that's in fact the

910
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,720
curiosity rover

911
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,880
so um would any of these have been able

912
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,880
to run doom but if you look at the rad

913
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,799
6000 against the absolute minimum you

914
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,520
need to run doom being an intel 386

915
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,640
the rad can do it it's got 35

916
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,799
um whoops versus the minimum of about

917
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,320
11.4

918
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,840
and because it's clocked down on the

919
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,919
river to about 20 megahertz it could

920
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,679
still do it so it would seem that we're

921
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:54,559
in luck

922
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,640
but none of those rovers are running so

923
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,760
let's see what else we could use

924
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,919
so in 2012 something interesting comes

925
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,640
to miles or something curious let's say

926
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,360
and uh uses this awesome sky crane thing

927
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,039
which is quite different and extremely

928
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:09,760
impressive

929
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,720
now most of you have watched

930
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,880
documentaries around this but this is of

931
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,519
course

932
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,799
the mars science laboratory or msl and

933
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,320
we want to know immediately does this

934
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,000
thing run doom

935
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,279
so let's look at some system

936
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,640
requirements well we need to consider

937
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,080
the cpu the ram

938
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,720
um some hard disk space of course uh

939
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,480
some networking just to get some

940
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,159
software on there of course what type of

941
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,640
os it's running some power and maybe a

942
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,080
display

943
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,159
some sound and a keyboard and mouse so

944
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,600
let's take a look inside

945
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,919
this is what curiosity looks like when

946
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,360
you pop the hood open and i know what

947
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,159
you're thinking but

948
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,279
no that is not a cpu cooler

949
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,000
it's the sam sample analysis at mars

950
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,600
units and it's actually

951
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,399
um what the drill deposits um just in

952
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,279
dust and

953
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,919
drilling samples into and it uses um

954
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,840
this kind of vibrating sieve

955
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,080
where it can actually make a sound and

956
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,960
there's this

957
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,240
story that every year um on its birthday

958
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,039
curiosity sings happy birthday to itself

959
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,799
that's actually not exactly true it only

960
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,080
did it once

961
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,120
in 2012 or 2013 obviously

962
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,720
and i don't know this kind of got me

963
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,840
thinking about the difference in the

964
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,760
atmospheric pressure between

965
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,799
um earth and mars being quite phenomenal

966
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,360
and i thought well maybe just maybe if

967
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,720
you get the drill involved

968
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,080
you could do something like this

969
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,600
some of you might recognize this this is

970
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,840
called the floppy crown it's uh just a

971
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,799
bit of a

972
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,679
retro thing where um yeah they've

973
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,279
programmed this thing to be able to

974
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:43,840
play midi files

975
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,399
um let's get back to the cpu though and

976
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,360
if you're looking

977
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,600
um back into what curiosity looks like

978
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,399
inside

979
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,760
this is probably where you should be

980
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,120
looking and if you had to draw one of

981
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,640
those cards out eventually

982
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,120
you'd find this one and on that you

983
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,080
would find

984
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,039
the power pc rad 750 cpu by bae systems

985
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,840
now that's what it looks like inside and

986
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,000
no it doesn't run at 200 megahertz as as

987
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,600
most people saying what the spec says on

988
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,039
curiosity it actually runs

989
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,720
at 133 megahertz it's got 256 megabytes

990
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,440
of ram

991
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,519
and 2 gigabytes of storage and it's

992
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,640
actually got all of this

993
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,720
twice because the rover has two

994
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,000
different computers a

995
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,080
and b and it switches between the two of

996
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,679
them depending on whether or not one is

997
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,279
giving issues or if they want to create

998
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,880
software updates or anything else like

999
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,440
that

1000
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,960
so from system requirements point of

1001
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,200
view we've at least got enough cpu

1002
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,320
um ram and storage to maybe get doom

1003
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,480
running on this thing so i was thinking

1004
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,640
about how i could test this myself

1005
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,159
and the power pc rad 750

1006
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,519
10 20 years ago costed 200 000

1007
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,279
back in 2002 so in 2020 that's almost

1008
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,799
three hundred thousand dollars or more

1009
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:53,440
than five

1010
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,840
million south african rands so this got

1011
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,039
me thinking that

1012
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,279
the cpu is after all part of the power

1013
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,279
750 micro architecture

1014
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,120
which includes the radiation hardened

1015
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,519
version but also a motorola version used

1016
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,360
by apple in some of its computers

1017
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,159
and by ibm so if you look at the

1018
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,159
motorola version this was popular

1019
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,440
in the late 90s early 2000s and was also

1020
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,079
used in the original imac

1021
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,719
so i went out onto olx and bought myself

1022
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,679
one of these

1023
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,760
um for about two and a half grand went

1024
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,119
onto gumtree and got myself an

1025
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,918
equivalent laptop from 2001 this is an

1026
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,359
ibook 3g

1027
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,199
and then i went on a bit of a ram change

1028
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,520
because along with the g3 i needed to

1029
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,399
get the g4

1030
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,560
and the g5 because i needed all the

1031
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,399
power pc max but that's

1032
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,040
probably um for another talk in another

1033
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,599
day

1034
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,040
but this left me in a position where i

1035
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,119
had some comparable systems that i could

1036
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,320
actually run this on

1037
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,239
without using virtualization or anything

1038
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,599
else so i could rely

1039
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,520
completely on bare metal to see if i

1040
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,199
could get this working

1041
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,960
now the operating system becomes another

1042
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,760
concern and the curiosity rover runs

1043
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,839
vx works just like previous rovers

1044
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,640
specifically version 6.9 not the latest

1045
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,000
version 7.

1046
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,160
and if i want to compile doom for vx

1047
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,280
works well

1048
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,440
i went and got myself a copy of a much

1049
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,760
older version that uses vxworks version

1050
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,359
5. this is tornado

1051
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,440
that you'd use to create either a

1052
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,640
bootable image

1053
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,040
or a task that you could upload to

1054
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,240
something that's running a different

1055
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,119
sort of image

1056
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,119
obviously it runs in windows xp just to

1057
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,480
kind of mess around with

1058
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,079
and initially i'm just going to speed

1059
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,520
this up a little bit but i created my

1060
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,160
own little

1061
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,680
hello world just to prove that i could

1062
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,160
get a task running in vxworks

1063
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
where i could be running doom or at

1064
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,920
least just you know get something

1065
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,680
printed out

1066
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,040
so at this point it was time to add in

1067
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,880
the original doom source files

1068
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,040
and start working on a vxworks version

1069
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,359
of this and uh well first you have to

1070
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:46,640
put in the headers and then the c

1071
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,119
files and i've sped this up as well um

1072
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:49,680
so

1073
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,680
yeah this is quite a good ide for its

1074
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,119
time i reckon it helps you manage

1075
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,480
dependencies between different classes

1076
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,599
but i quickly ran

1077
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,760
into some pretty serious errors and

1078
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,680
issues and this was incredibly

1079
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,040
frustrating if you just look at one of

1080
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,240
the first ones over here

1081
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,280
look at that d think h line 48

1082
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,599
and if you go open up the file it does

1083
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,440
have a semicolon i don't know what this

1084
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,040
thing's complaining about

1085
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,839
it does have a semicolon so i kind of

1086
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,000
gave up on that

1087
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,880
vxworks has multiple security issues in

1088
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,839
any case and

1089
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,359
while we're not going to explore that in

1090
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,119
this talk it is interesting to consider

1091
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,240
how many issues

1092
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,560
there are but the makers of vehicle

1093
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,599
works also

1094
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,760
create something called wind river linux

1095
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,960
and linux is a good

1096
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,640
option that would be able to run on this

1097
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640
kind of hardware so for the hardware i

1098
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,440
had in mind i chose yellowdog which was

1099
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,800
a derivative of red hat actually and got

1100
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,000
that on my ibook

1101
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,839
and uh started messing around with that

1102
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,160
so first loaded up my source files now i

1103
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,839
needed to make some changes that i'll

1104
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,359
chat about a little bit later

1105
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,839
to get this working on a power pc

1106
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:52,960
because we are working

1107
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,560
with a big engine and not a little

1108
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,000
endian um

1109
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,280
cpu but if i click make

1110
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,240
it goes on and and creates um an

1111
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,760
executable for me and there you can see

1112
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,400
i've got

1113
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,079
a linux steam executable like i had

1114
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,160
before and it runs just fine

1115
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,760
the colors are a little bit messed up

1116
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,000
because like you saw in the previous

1117
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,839
version where i ran this on red hat

1118
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,400
every time i wanted to do a screen grab

1119
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,920
it messed up the colors of the game but

1120
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,280
it's actually the other way around the

1121
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,640
game's colors look fine when you're

1122
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,240
actually playing and interacting

1123
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,119
with that x window and of course it ran

1124
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,200
fine on my imac 3g as well and all of

1125
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,200
the other power pcs and i've put this up

1126
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,520
on

1127
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,599
github for you guys to take a look at

1128
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,040
and mess around with and contribute to

1129
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,000
if you like

1130
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,359
so it really looks like we're making

1131
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,760
progress here

1132
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,520
so why the massive price difference

1133
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,400
between a rad 750 or five years ago

1134
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,800
and an imac 3g that would have costed me

1135
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,880
almost 200 percent less

1136
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,680
20 years ago the answer duke is

1137
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,960
radiation

1138
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,720
radiation obviously pouring out of the

1139
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,560
sun radiation that we need to deal with

1140
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,920
when we travel through the van allen

1141
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,640
belts

1142
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,720
radiation as a result of supernova

1143
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,440
explosions in other galaxies and our own

1144
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,119
and the general cosmic background

1145
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,640
radiation that

1146
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,960
emits tons and tons of particles out in

1147
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,079
space and one of my

1148
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,280
favorite papers that i found regarding

1149
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,320
this kind of stuff on the effects of

1150
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,040
radiation and specifically cosmic rays

1151
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,240
on dram

1152
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,560
came from a study they did in 2009 on

1153
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,920
some google servers

1154
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,320
and they found that for

1155
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,359
non-error-corrected memory the mean

1156
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,960
error rate amounted to 3751

1157
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,680
errors per year so think about that the

1158
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,119
next time you have a bug in your

1159
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,160
software

1160
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,000
but anyway radiation hardening is of

1161
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,520
course what we're chatting about and why

1162
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,119
this is so expensive

1163
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,720
and you get a bunch of different

1164
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,320
scenarios that can come up

1165
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,160
specifically things like single event

1166
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,160
upsets latch ups and

1167
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,640
gate ruptures which sound pretty serious

1168
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,760
so let's take a look at

1169
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,640
why and how this kind of stuff works

1170
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,000
most of you would have seen

1171
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,440
a logic gate represented like this and

1172
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,359
it's pretty much the hardware equivalent

1173
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,359
of what you could write in software like

1174
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,079
this

1175
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,800
and yeah if we take inputs a and b at

1176
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,760
the top there

1177
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,480
if i put in 0 and 1 of course i get 0 if

1178
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,880
i put in 1 and 0 i get 0 but if i put in

1179
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,720
1 and 1 i get 1.

1180
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,200
so how does radiation affect this well

1181
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
let's look deeper inside a gate and see

1182
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,800
how to build one and to build an

1183
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,160
and gate you'll need two transistors

1184
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,960
and if we add some current in on this

1185
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,599
side

1186
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,359
and put a one in on that side so we're

1187
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,040
adding in current from this side

1188
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,040
it'll open the gate and the electricity

1189
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,160
will flow through

1190
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,160
to the next transistor and if we put

1191
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,000
nothing in there we get nothing out

1192
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,800
which is

1193
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,200
a correct and operation and of course if

1194
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,520
we do put some current in on the other b

1195
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,599
side current will go in it'll open up

1196
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,440
that side it'll ground and we'll get a

1197
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,320
one and our transistor works perfectly

1198
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,440
however if we wanted to zoom in and see

1199
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,040
what these things actually look like

1200
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,520
everything's based on a silicon

1201
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,400
substrate

1202
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,240
and if a high energy neutron had to

1203
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,160
smash through the inside of this

1204
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,960
npn transistor the substrate would get

1205
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,280
damaged and we could end up with a short

1206
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,200
circuit between the two sides

1207
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,119
and as a result our transistor would

1208
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,880
always be on

1209
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,079
so if we tried to turn it off this would

1210
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,440
be incorrect

1211
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,680
and it would kind of show you all the

1212
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,200
different things that can go wrong

1213
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,359
with your transistor and thus the

1214
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:22,880
massive price difference for the

1215
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,720
proprietary techniques that companies

1216
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,960
like bae systems go to

1217
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,280
to make these things cost as much as

1218
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,040
they do

1219
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,960
so let's chat about power just for fun

1220
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,720
for a second and consider what type of

1221
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,599
psu

1222
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,000
a rover like curiosity uses what

1223
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
actually uses something called an rtg or

1224
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,240
radioisotope thermoelectric generator

1225
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,599
where it's got

1226
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,800
scolding hot plutonium-238 inside and

1227
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,720
it takes advantage of that to create

1228
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,960
electricity plutonium of course having

1229
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,240
a half-life of 87 years so it stays hot

1230
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,400
for a very long time and using thermal

1231
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,200
couples

1232
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,599
in an rtg like this this is curiosity's

1233
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,520
actual rtg

1234
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,680
it actually takes 4.8 kilograms of the

1235
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,200
square shape

1236
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,280
pieces of plutonium but yes that gets

1237
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,200
mounted into the back of the rover

1238
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,760
over here and that's what gives it power

1239
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,200
very similar to what you see

1240
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,440
on some of the other voyager and pioneer

1241
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,319
spacecraft

1242
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:17,599
where they're kept a little bit away

1243
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,359
from some of the instrumentation

1244
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,720
so that at least solves the power

1245
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,520
problem for us quickly

1246
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,359
so let's talk about networking

1247
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,599
specifically the deep space network

1248
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,319
and how we communicate with rovers on

1249
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,040
mars

1250
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,079
from earth now at its best

1251
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,280
earth is only 54 million kilometers away

1252
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,280
um and it takes about three minutes for

1253
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,720
a signal to get there traveling at the

1254
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,400
speed of light but at worst when we're

1255
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,240
on the other side of the sun

1256
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,119
it's 401 kilometers or 23 minutes and

1257
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,560
that's almost an

1258
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,119
hour for signals to get there and come

1259
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,800
back and there's all the processing and

1260
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,800
relaying that happens in the meantime

1261
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,800
so of course real-time communications or

1262
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,319
popping opening an open

1263
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,520
ssh connection is not an option

1264
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,760
but um how does this network even work

1265
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,640
in the first place

1266
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,200
well they've got uh the massive

1267
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,079
gladstone

1268
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,079
antenna in the united states another one

1269
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,440
in australia

1270
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,920
at canberra and another one in madrid

1271
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,119
and what this does

1272
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,839
is they have overlapping signal which

1273
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,520
means that mars

1274
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,599
always has at least one antenna pointed

1275
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,440
to it at any one time and whether they

1276
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,079
can maintain

1277
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,480
constant communications and once you're

1278
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,160
on that side you can take advantage of

1279
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,760
the rover on the surface

1280
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,720
by using the mars odyssey or mars

1281
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,800
reconnaissance orbiter or the eso build

1282
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,240
mars express

1283
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,079
orbiters which can all relay

1284
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,640
communications back to earth much faster

1285
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,319
so some of you might be thinking is this

1286
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,000
an opportunity for software-defined

1287
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,480
radio can we use dongles that are

1288
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,520
cheaply

1289
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,000
commercially available to pull data out

1290
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,920
of this system the same way we do

1291
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,160
from weather satellites and the answer

1292
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,720
is absolutely not

1293
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,480
if you look at the gladstone antenna as

1294
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,040
an example this thing is 70 meters

1295
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,960
across and even if you could plug your

1296
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,079
sdr into it

1297
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,000
you'd probably need to cool your sdr

1298
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,760
down in liquid nitrogen to get it

1299
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,760
sensitive enough to be able to pick up

1300
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,359
the signals required especially if

1301
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:12,560
you're going to

1302
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,160
communicate with even deeper space

1303
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,240
probes so when it comes to

1304
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,800
new ways of putting yourself in gel this

1305
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,920
isn't an option i'd recommend

1306
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,680
so let's consider the last system

1307
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,200
requirements we're going to have here

1308
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,640
specifically the display and the

1309
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,920
keyboard on mouse

1310
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,359
and i know what you're thinking the

1311
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,760
rover doesn't have any of these things

1312
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,079
and if you look inside and consult the

1313
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,079
spec sheet you will find that it can

1314
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,200
handle

1315
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,200
something called compact pci now this is

1316
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,040
not your regular pci that you might

1317
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:41,760
remember

1318
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,599
but more back plane like this that all

1319
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,119
those boards plug into

1320
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,119
so if you did find this rover or you use

1321
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,640
the one in the mars yard

1322
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,040
you could plug one of these into it and

1323
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,720
get some hdmi outputs

1324
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,240
but that's probably not feasible for

1325
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,480
what we want to do and for fun we can

1326
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,920
think about what we could do with that

1327
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,640
laser

1328
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,800
but it wouldn't be a feasible way of

1329
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,560
projecting anything anywhere or actually

1330
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,560
using that as a display

1331
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,079
so doom's linux version actually uses

1332
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,880
the x windows system and here's

1333
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,400
typically what it looks like so when you

1334
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,200
run that

1335
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,359
it starts up x in the background which

1336
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:16,960
is the default linux

1337
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,800
window manager and there you've got it

1338
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,640
working in an x window

1339
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,160
now one of the things i want us to

1340
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,560
consider are demos and

1341
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,960
doom has demos where it records key

1342
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,760
presses

1343
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,280
and one of the ways in which you can do

1344
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,000
this and and this is a very popular way

1345
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,200
of distributing files and demos of how

1346
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,880
people have done things in doom

1347
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,040
but anyway if you want to record um

1348
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,240
record your own one

1349
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,480
um here this is my compiled linux

1350
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,160
version i just tacked in there

1351
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,480
record and here i'm shooting some zombie

1352
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,880
men i'm recording to a file called my

1353
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,319
demo

1354
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,599
and notice that i've included just a

1355
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,040
little bit of more output so whenever i

1356
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,000
file the gun

1357
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,319
it says weapon fired you press key to

1358
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,160
exit don't worry that's not an error but

1359
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,280
you do have

1360
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,760
that lmp file and if you just go double

1361
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,440
check by doing a quick la ls on

1362
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,040
the directory we've been running doom

1363
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,359
from you'll see we've got

1364
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,160
this file and it's quite small so

1365
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,800
awesome how do we play this back well

1366
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,640
you're just going to tack on the play

1367
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,920
demo option

1368
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,400
and refer to the file now you must

1369
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,839
remember to always take the extension

1370
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:20,319
off

1371
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,160
but here i'm not touching the keyboard

1372
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,000
and it's playing through exactly the

1373
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,119
same demo

1374
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,599
that we had before and that's pretty

1375
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,599
useful that might be a viable way

1376
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,680
of running doom on something if we

1377
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,359
didn't need the screen

1378
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,200
so let's take a look at that i made some

1379
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,480
modifications

1380
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,280
to the source code and added a new

1381
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:39,680
option

1382
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,400
called no display that i could add and i

1383
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,440
could then run

1384
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,800
this and not get x up or initiate any of

1385
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,640
the video stuff but still run

1386
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,680
the core game so if i run this now um

1387
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,160
with no display and i play my demo file

1388
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,359
meaning i don't need

1389
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,920
a display or a keyboard now at all

1390
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,200
notice that it's not bringing up

1391
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,000
anything but it

1392
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,960
is busy playing the game and running the

1393
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,480
renderer and everything else it's just

1394
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,480
not displaying it to anything

1395
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,760
and it is running in good time so i've

1396
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,880
put this all up on my github repository

1397
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,480
for the mac version i'll port it over to

1398
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,000
power pc soon

1399
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,160
and um yeah that's something fun to look

1400
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,079
at so at this point we can probably

1401
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,680
safely say that the display

1402
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,400
sound and keyboard are not even required

1403
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,839
and this whole thing of running do one

1404
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:26,560
rover

1405
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,760
is probably plausible so

1406
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,000
finally i'd like you to consider that

1407
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,599
many years from now

1408
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,599
somebody somewhere is going to find one

1409
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:36,880
of these rovers and they're going to

1410
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,760
look at the

1411
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,440
memory of those rovers and wouldn't it

1412
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,560
be grand if they found something more

1413
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,000
fun than just a plaque

1414
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,640
or a golden record but actually an

1415
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,480
interactive piece of history that they

1416
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,599
could play with

1417
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,240
and mess around with um it even comes to

1418
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:52,800
mind that

1419
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,359
if maybe aliens or someone hostile had

1420
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,800
to find this they could have

1421
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,359
some fair warning about what we here on

1422
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,760
earth are all about and what we're into

1423
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,240
but um yeah with that all the best to

1424
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,200
the mars 2020 prosperity rover

1425
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,200
i've got my name on that rover i'm one

1426
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,680
of the 11 almost 11 million people

1427
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,920
who's made my mark on that and i'd like

1428
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,599
you to encourage what kind of mark you

1429
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,280
want to make and what kind of mark you

1430
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,319
want to leave

1431
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,000
that's it for me here's my github and

1432
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,839
twitter enjoy the rest of your

1433
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,839
conference
