1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:08,720
hey

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,200
everyone and welcome to my talk today in

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,960
order to have future foresight it

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,559
requires that we

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,239
look back at events that have already

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,480
taken place and that is what i'll be

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,320
doing in my talk today

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,240
i'll be presenting a retrospective of

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,160
2020 looking at all of the major

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,320
security news and events that have taken

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,039
place

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,039
in the past year as well as some

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,359
commentary and analysis from myself

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,558
this is the third year that i'm

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,000
presenting such a talk at this

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,800
conference

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,120
although this year is under slightly

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,879
different circumstances

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,120
just a quick introduction about myself

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,360
i'm a cloud architect i specialize in

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,960
security and enterprise cloud

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,079
architecture

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,399
my research interests include privacy

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,399
security and disinformation

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,719
i have a number of aws certifications

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,680
and working on

27
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,440
getting some additional certifications

28
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,800
over the next year

29
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,120
i have a new upcoming website called

30
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,280
critical void which explores the

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,280
intersection of science technology and

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,600
culture through the lens of information

33
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,640
security

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,720
it's not public yet but will be in the

35
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,159
near future and i hope

36
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,880
that you will read it when it is public

37
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,280
my twitter handle is achara nordio

38
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,400
i will be tweeting out a twitter thread

39
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,880
throughout this talk with links to some

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,720
of the things that i'm going to

41
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,600
cover in this talk today so my talk will

42
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,000
cover

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,159
2020 including all of the major news

44
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,040
stories

45
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,119
including covert 19 which is the major

46
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,560
theme of 2020

47
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,720
with some additional themes around that

48
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,920
which includes phishing

49
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,040
disinformation online game cheating the

50
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,439
insider threat satellite security

51
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,040
and some of the trends that we've seen

52
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,880
in malware and ransomware over the past

53
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,000
year

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,960
the first major theme is remote working

55
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,799
so as the pandemic took

56
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,680
over and infection started to spread

57
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,000
across

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,079
the world we saw a lot of hoarding

59
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,360
taking place

60
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,399
and people started going into lockdown

61
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,119
from the first week of march by april at

62
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,200
least 80 countries had some form of

63
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,878
of lockdown in place and people had to

64
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,599
start working remotely from home many

65
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,560
countries

66
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,959
already had some kind of remote working

67
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,879
before the pandemic took over

68
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,280
with the netherlands leading the pack at

69
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,480
about 14 percent

70
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,120
of the population having some kind of

71
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,480
remote working

72
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,040
agreements already in place so some of

73
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,599
the

74
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,120
major challenges the companies

75
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,879
experienced with remote working

76
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,640
was that they didn't have enough laptops

77
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,560
to send home to the employees

78
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,800
since many of them rely on desktop

79
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,319
machines

80
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,160
many companies had to go procure

81
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,080
additional laptops and with the shipping

82
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,360
restrictions in place

83
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,440
this was quite a challenge many of them

84
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,959
had to resort to

85
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,040
second-hand laptops or laptops that were

86
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,239
destined

87
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,360
to be recycled companies also allowed

88
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,160
their employees to use personal devices

89
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,319
and many of these devices were shared in

90
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,599
the family so

91
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,519
mom and dad would use the device during

92
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,440
the day and then the child would use the

93
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,920
device in the evening to play games on

94
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
this poses a massive security threat

95
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,760
because the child would often

96
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,319
download unwanted software or

97
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,519
potentially malware

98
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,280
which would put the information stored

99
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,440
on that device at risk

100
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,800
many companies also lacked a byod or

101
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,159
bring your own device or

102
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,000
as i like to call it bring your own

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
disaster policies

104
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,959
many families experienced problems with

105
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:29,920
space

106
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,640
not having you know dedicated offices or

107
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,920
sometimes having to

108
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,959
share space in their apartments

109
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,519
which could sometimes cause problems

110
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,159
vpns were another big problem where

111
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,159
concentrators were not designed to

112
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,760
handle the load that they were expected

113
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,319
to

114
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,360
to handle and new concentrators had to

115
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,560
be purchased

116
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,799
uh threat intel and user behavioral

117
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,000
analytics tools

118
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,040
also started misbehaving as the

119
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,959
employees started working remotely on

120
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,159
these new devices

121
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,120
coming in from unknown ip sometimes a

122
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,159
lot of these tools

123
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,519
would create false positives

124
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,400
of suspicious activity or anomalous

125
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,840
activity

126
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,319
personally we saw with aws god duty as

127
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,360
people were

128
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,759
working remotely that we started to see

129
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,600
dozens and hundreds of alerts

130
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,000
uh starting to get fired as a result of

131
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,360
this this all

132
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,440
collectively led to the meme going

133
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,720
around as to

134
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,960
who really led digital transformation in

135
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,080
the company

136
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,199
it was definitely covert 19 and not some

137
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,880
c-level executive

138
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,120
so one of the big challenges over the

139
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,160
past year was

140
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,800
patch management and who should pay for

141
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,080
data during upgrade

142
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,840
so a lot of administrative staff were

143
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,360
sent home with laptops

144
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,120
and data bundles between three to five

145
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,520
gigabytes that were more than sufficient

146
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,520
for the employees to do their work

147
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,440
however when they needed to do updates

148
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,120
on these devices

149
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,040
that is where they would run into

150
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,320
problems since their

151
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,320
data allowance wouldn't be enough to

152
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,000
cover their work and

153
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,720
for the updates to take place depending

154
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,080
on the software installed on the

155
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,960
machines

156
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,440
this these updates could easily total 15

157
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,520
to 20 gigabytes especially

158
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,960
finance engineering and design software

159
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,600
many companies experience problems with

160
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,000
doing

161
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,639
updates from the on-premise networks

162
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,560
because

163
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,479
they had policies in place which would

164
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,800
prevent updates from taking place over

165
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,919
vpn

166
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,240
due to the bandwidth constraints that

167
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,960
they had

168
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,560
in their data sensors and sometimes the

169
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,479
subnets needed to do the updates were

170
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,479
also not available on the vpn

171
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,960
sometimes intentionally for bandwidth

172
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,639
reasons

173
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,639
we also saw a lot of sys administrators

174
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,280
were reluctant to push new gpos over vpn

175
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,240
connections

176
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,360
mainly ptsd from windows server 2003 and

177
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,720
2012

178
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
where gpos would often fail when they

179
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,680
were pushed over remote connections

180
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,639
the perimeter controls were another big

181
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,560
issue where a lot of traffic had to be

182
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,160
back called into the data center to

183
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,240
break out to the proxies and

184
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,319
since a lot of large corporates have

185
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,280
legacy

186
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,840
network topologies where they may have

187
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,680
multiple buildings and each building

188
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,319
is then dedicated a set of proxies with

189
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,639
the ability to fail over between them

190
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,240
however when everybody is working

191
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,960
remotely this

192
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,680
this design often can fall flat and a

193
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,720
lot of

194
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,759
companies had challenges uh dealing

195
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,840
with with internet access uh from their

196
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,240
devices

197
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,520
one of the things that we saw with

198
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,600
remote working is the increase in cloud

199
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,720
adoption where

200
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,680
many companies used the scalability and

201
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,520
elasticity of the cloud

202
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,880
to address their work from home

203
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,240
challenges what we also saw then was

204
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,759
a lot of cloud providers starting to

205
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,520
have capacity constraints

206
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,080
especially microsoft degener one of the

207
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,440
best practices

208
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,039
when you go through your cloud journey

209
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,800
and as you adopt cloud

210
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,479
is to look at workloads that can be

211
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,560
turned off when they are not needed

212
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,639
this would typically be over weekends

213
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,880
and during evenings

214
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,440
however if you were to actually do that

215
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,039
and you switched off

216
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,280
your workloads when they were not needed

217
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
and you happen to be a microsoft azure

218
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,639
customer

219
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,160
there was a very real risk that you

220
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,080
wouldn't be able to bring that workload

221
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,199
up when you actually needed it and this

222
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,560
is a massive risk that companies needed

223
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,599
to address

224
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,599
and also potentially leading to awkward

225
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,960
situations with

226
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
c-level executives when production

227
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,680
workloads could not be brought up

228
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,000
so as people started working from home

229
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,919
we saw that the workday started to

230
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,319
increase a study done on 3.1 million

231
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:42,800
people

232
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,879
showed that the average workday

233
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,639
increased by 48 minutes

234
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,160
something which was actually backed up

235
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,319
by browser telemetry

236
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,160
so this is actually something we saw in

237
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,319
our microsoft teams usage we adopted

238
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,759
microsoft teams

239
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,080
about two years ago initially moving

240
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,360
away from slack

241
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,680
due to the features that microsoft teams

242
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,520
had as well as from a licensing

243
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,560
perspective

244
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,639
we've seen in the data that our teams

245
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,800
are highly effective

246
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,080
with remote working including

247
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,759
working on the weekends and in the

248
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,000
evenings which is not ideal

249
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,199
one of our favorite features of

250
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,680
microsoft teams is the fact that

251
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,000
we can record meetings that then get

252
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,360
published to stream

253
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,360
we host many tech sessions at our

254
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,800
company and

255
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,080
having uh being able to build a catalog

256
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,799
of these videos as we as we have these

257
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,719
meetings with very little effort

258
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,479
is something that's something that's

259
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,919
very valuable to us

260
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,760
what we saw earlier this year was that

261
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
slack filed anti-trust lawsuits against

262
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
microsoft for the success of their

263
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,800
microsoft teams product in the eu which

264
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,160
is ironic since

265
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,800
 created a newspaper advert really

266
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,560
embracing microsoft teams

267
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,880
when the product was first announced

268
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,880
with all of the remote working

269
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,760
we saw a lot of companies embracing

270
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,040
video conferencing and

271
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,760
remote collaboration tools this all led

272
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,959
to a massive spark

273
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,200
in bandwidth that we saw on the internet

274
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,160
exchanges

275
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,480
where many internet exchanges saw a

276
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,160
growth between 25

277
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,200
and 75 percent some internet exchanges

278
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,880
saw the amount of data that they had to

279
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,920
process

280
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,760
doubling or even tripling in some

281
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,959
instances

282
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,880
most of this traffic was video

283
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,880
conferencing voip entertainment

284
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,360
and clock gaming related and yes just

285
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,440
some graphs that we saw from eclix with

286
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,120
that really shows the

287
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,440
increase in traffic many isps had to

288
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,360
take action to keep their network stable

289
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,440
many of these actions included

290
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,800
moving their traffic around and

291
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,279
prioritizing certain traffic over others

292
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,560
which actually goes against net

293
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,640
neutrality rules but they did this in

294
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,399
order to keep their network

295
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,880
performance and stable something that

296
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,920
the regulators

297
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,880
also agreed was okay for them to do and

298
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,399
some of these

299
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,640
isps had to trade some resilience in

300
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,000
their network in order to gain

301
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,440
performance to keep

302
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,560
their users happy with the remote

303
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,720
working situation a lot of companies had

304
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,560
to embrace video conferencing

305
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,920
and many of them rushed to embrace zoom

306
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,480
and due to their self-service platform

307
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,920
they really happened to be quite

308
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,959
successful

309
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,000
zoom saw their revenue double from 910

310
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,360
million dollars to one point seven nine

311
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,440
billion dollars on their last earning

312
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,839
school they are seeing 300 million

313
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,200
participants per day

314
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,240
with countless schools and universities

315
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,880
around the world using their services

316
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,959
a lot of privacy and security flaws have

317
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:35,920
been

318
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,440
brought up by various security

319
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,720
professionals and one of the big

320
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,920
problems was

321
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,240
the issue of zoom bombing where

322
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,399
teenagers or sometimes other

323
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,480
individuals would go on to these calls

324
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,040
and would start

325
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,360
bombing the session through the use of

326
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,279
profanity sometimes they would turn on

327
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,480
their camera

328
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,800
and they wouldn't have any clothes on

329
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,000
and this was quite a

330
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,720
big challenge that a lot of people had

331
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,160
some of the security and privacy

332
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,079
concerns that were raised includes

333
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,680
their false claims about end-to-end

334
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,920
encryption an attention tracking feature

335
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,839
that got a lot of negative press

336
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,360
user data that was being sent to

337
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,920
facebook no email verification on

338
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,240
accounts and various security flaws that

339
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,640
could expose highly sensitive data there

340
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,760
was also a flaw that

341
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,399
allowed privileged escalation on both

342
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,160
windows and mac os

343
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,640
and the zoom client when uninstalled on

344
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,000
mac os didn't

345
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,680
remove the web server that was running

346
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,720
on the device apple had to use their own

347
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,600
services in order to go remove that web

348
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,079
server off mac os devices

349
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,920
so as zoom was going through this trial

350
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,720
by fire the zoom ceo

351
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,360
hired alex thomas the ex cesar of

352
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,640
facebook to

353
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,680
help run some of the security programs

354
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,680
at zoom one of the first things that

355
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,279
alex did was is he

356
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,000
initiated a 90-day freeze period so that

357
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,600
they could address various

358
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,920
security vulnerabilities and privacy

359
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,800
concerns

360
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,959
and only once that was done would he

361
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,880
allow new features to be rolled out to

362
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,839
the product

363
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,760
alex was also key in the acquisition of

364
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,000
key

365
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,880
base baazim ki bes had been working on

366
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,480
their own

367
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,040
video conferencing solution that

368
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,680
supported enter in encrypted encryption

369
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,959
which was then incorporated into zoom

370
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,279
and zoom announced then that they would

371
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,600
offer free end-to-end encryption

372
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,760
to their paying customers they received

373
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,720
a lot of

374
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,880
criticism over this because it was only

375
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,560
for paying customers and they wanted

376
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,839
everybody to get it

377
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,480
eventually zoom caved and said that all

378
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,800
users will get free internet encryption

379
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,880
and they then recently rolled this out

380
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,240
about a month ago

381
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,880
so enter in encryption is now possible

382
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,680
with zoom

383
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,000
so what we saw with the pandemic is the

384
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,760
emergence of remote courts

385
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,920
hearings and sessions most of them took

386
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,519
place on zoom

387
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,959
at the bottom of the slide you can see

388
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,959
an example of a courtroom i believe

389
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,720
that's a federal court

390
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,800
the screenshots above that is actually a

391
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,480
youtuber that i followed they

392
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,240
that had to close a probate deal in

393
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,800
court he had to share highly sensitive

394
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,120
financial information which was actually

395
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,440
done over a screen share which is one of

396
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,519
the bad things about

397
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,680
these remote core proceedings however

398
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,160
there were are many benefits including

399
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,120
the timing and convenience to

400
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,240
participants

401
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,360
the transparency that it enables and

402
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
witness credibility where judges can

403
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,639
actually see

404
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,240
the emotions better over zoom

405
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,360
of participants than they can sometimes

406
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,399
in courtrooms and in child custody cases

407
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,560
the first-hand home assessment

408
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,120
that can be done by the judge is

409
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,600
sometimes very beneficial

410
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,240
in making a decision as to who she can

411
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,160
custody over a child

412
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,320
this all led to zoom stock performing

413
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,279
really well

414
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,560
with zoom stock increasing by over 638

415
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,680
percent

416
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,800
in march a lot of investors were buying

417
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,279
the wrong

418
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,279
zoom stock and the sec actually had to

419
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,040
step in and

420
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,279
ban the other zoom stock from being

421
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,160
traded on

422
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,600
the stock exchanges one of the funny

423
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,920
things was that these tech giants had to

424
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,199
testify before

425
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,720
congress on webex which is you know just

426
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,399
a terrible product and i think it was

427
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,160
quite frustrating for some of them

428
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,079
you could also see the various highly

429
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,440
staged backgrounds

430
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,800
especially with jeff bezos he's clearly

431
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,480
sitting on a stage with very high

432
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,920
quality lighting there

433
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,360
so one of the good things with the

434
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
pandemic is that

435
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,199
a lot of the tools for media creation

436
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,040
video conferencing live streaming and

437
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,160
collaboration

438
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,320
have gotten a lot better even when

439
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,000
things go back to normal this is going

440
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,920
to be a huge one for us

441
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,120
in this example i'm showing glenn weiss

442
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,040
an emmy winning director directing the

443
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,600
dnc conference remotely over

444
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,120
and you can also see photos of the emmys

445
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,760
where they sent 140 video production

446
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,959
kits to various

447
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,560
celebrities so that they could join

448
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,120
remotely companies that have enabled and

449
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,000
embraced

450
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,920
remote working technologies have seen

451
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,360
their stocks soar

452
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,000
many companies saw triple digit growth

453
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,560
which is

454
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,040
very unusual in the stock market one of

455
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,160
the big themes of 2020 was zero trust

456
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,079
now zero trust in the pulse has always

457
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,160
been tied to network isolation however

458
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,760
to get the true benefit

459
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,079
of xero trust we need to look at how

460
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,279
identity

461
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,000
context and the state of an endpoint or

462
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,880
device

463
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,240
can be evaluated in order for a specific

464
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,360
action to be allowed

465
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,360
and this is something that google's

466
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,839
bianco has been able to do

467
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,320
they have expanded the beyondcorp

468
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,959
alliance to push sierra trust

469
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,600
further including announcing various

470
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
partnerships over the past year

471
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,880
cloudflare added additional features to

472
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,240
cloudflare access

473
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,040
as well as announcing cloudflare 1 which

474
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,240
merges a lot of the

475
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,920
existing products with features that

476
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,399
enable enterprises to push

477
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,360
xero trust in a very tangible way we

478
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,199
also saw the announcement of hashicorp

479
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,440
boundary a new open source product

480
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,560
to enable xero trust which also merges

481
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,040
the identity and network isolation

482
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,279
that's needed for xero trust and i'm

483
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,199
really excited to see where this project

484
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,519
goes over the next few years

485
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,399
so one of the other big themes of 2020

486
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,600
was fishing

487
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,839
as the pandemic took over a lot of

488
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:34,880
fishing kits

489
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,199
rapidly started adopting covered

490
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,560
mounting layers

491
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,560
a lot of them claimed to be from

492
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,079
authoritative sources

493
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,240
for example government or public health

494
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,800
care a lot of these phishing campaigns

495
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,680
were used for credential theft identity

496
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,399
theft

497
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,440
and malware and ransom deployment domain

498
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,720
tools has a list

499
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,320
of 154 000 domains that were linked to

500
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,160
covert 19 phishing

501
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,800
over a thousand phishing domains were

502
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,319
being registered per day

503
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,119
and often these phishing campaigns would

504
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:07,760
use

505
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,400
emotionally charged language in order to

506
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,000
get people to click on them

507
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,959
and google also announced earlier in the

508
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,959
year that they were blocking about 18

509
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,520
million coronavirus scam emails

510
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,679
per day and these are some of the

511
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,199
examples of the phishing

512
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,599
emails that went around many of them

513
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,400
coming from

514
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,319
authoritative sources like the world

515
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,840
health organization

516
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,640
or various public health entities some

517
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,520
of these

518
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,240
scams would claim that somebody that was

519
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,360
close to you had been

520
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,000
recently infected with covert 19 and you

521
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,240
had to take action on that

522
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,200
some of these emails just plain dropped

523
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,320
the ransomware

524
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,039
or malware onto the victims machine what

525
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,039
we saw with u.s stimulus is that a two

526
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:51,919
trillion dollar

527
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,640
care package was announced to stimulate

528
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
the economy this included

529
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,960
funding for stimulus checks unemployment

530
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
checks as well as help for

531
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,120
corporations and small businesses

532
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
through the sba loans

533
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,400
edl and ppp programs these programs

534
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,200
were announced in a very rapid way and

535
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,880
banks were not ready to take on these

536
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,640
new applications and scammers quickly

537
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,760
took advantage

538
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,240
of the confusion and lack of preparation

539
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,280
and started

540
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,120
scamming and phishing campaigns

541
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,160
regarding these various loan programs

542
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,960
as a result of the scams millions were

543
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,720
handed out to scammers

544
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,840
in a report compiled by the sba some

545
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
companies also applied for multiple

546
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,600
loans in other companies names

547
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,200
and one company was actually caught

548
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,039
supplying for 85 loans

549
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,440
which they were actually granted what we

550
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,120
also saw is a rapid

551
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
increase in fraud in healthcare

552
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,400
procurement

553
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,160
there's a really good example where

554
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,720
someone actually tweeted donald trump

555
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,400
around ventilators donald trump had one

556
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:54,880
of

557
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,640
his team members reach out to this

558
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,160
person and this person

559
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,440
scammed new york out of 69.1

560
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,000
million dollars we

561
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,280
1450 ventilators were meant to be

562
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,240
delivered

563
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,080
at three times the market rate but no

564
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
ventilators were ever delivered

565
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,799
an additional 355 million dollars were

566
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:15,520
spent

567
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,240
on medical equipment and ppe most of

568
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,400
this funding went to companies

569
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,320
who were not in the healthcare business

570
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,520
including high-end

571
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,400
fashion brands chinese iron ore and tool

572
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,360
importers

573
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,280
personal hygiene companies and oil

574
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,480
companies now

575
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,679
it should be mentioned that some of

576
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,840
these companies have good intentions

577
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,480
of actually trying to help the company

578
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,640
through the pandemic but some of them

579
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,880
merely saw it as a cash grab one of the

580
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,720
threats that also started emerging

581
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,679
was phishing what scammers would start

582
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,240
to do

583
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,320
is look for new employees they were

584
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,760
joining companies on

585
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,000
through linkedin and then they would

586
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,160
either pretend to be the new employees

587
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,280
and called the rt

588
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,400
team to get their credentials or

589
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,480
the scammers were pretending to be from

590
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,720
it and called these new employees

591
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,200
to get their credentials out of them and

592
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,799
this happened to both bank

593
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,760
of america as well as at t and verizon

594
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,200
as well as github

595
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,799
so the next theme that we'll have a look

596
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,720
at is online game cheating

597
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,640
in previous years i've spoken about the

598
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,799
emergence of online game cheating and

599
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,720
it's definitely not a new phenomenon

600
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,200
there have been a myriad of talks in the

601
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,799
early 2000s at

602
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,159
def con about online game cheating

603
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,159
a lot of these cheats often use tooling

604
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,400
to manipulate memory and pointers

605
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,559
to give the players that use them at

606
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,159
unfair advantage

607
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,240
this often allows players to be

608
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,799
invisible to other players get unlimited

609
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,120
emma currency or health to change their

610
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,919
positions or to jump around opponents

611
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,320
to shoot or see through walls to create

612
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,240
bullets that appear out of nowhere

613
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,520
as well as to get aiming assistance

614
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,159
as i spoke about last year there was a

615
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,280
massive increase

616
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,440
in online game cheating especially with

617
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,799
the fortnite

618
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,600
world cup that took place where over 1

619
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,000
200 players were banned for cheating

620
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,400
and with the lockdowns in place many

621
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,159
turned to online games

622
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,919
for entertainment resulting in

623
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,520
record-breaking numbers

624
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,480
of online users steam actually broke its

625
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,440
concurrent

626
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,360
number of users multiple times over the

627
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
past year one of the things that started

628
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:21,919
occurring

629
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,039
as esport tournaments went remote a lot

630
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:25,440
of the

631
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,559
servers experienced ddos attacks leading

632
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,559
to a huge amount of frustration amongst

633
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:30,960
pro

634
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,640
players so as these ddos attacks started

635
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,080
to take place

636
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,840
tournament organizers had to come up

637
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,520
with new ways on how to deal with the

638
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,799
problem

639
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,360
a lot of them started to stream gameplay

640
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,159
after

641
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,720
it had taken place this had the uns

642
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,919
unfortunate

643
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,559
side effect which affected the gambling

644
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,120
part

645
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,000
and betting part of the tournament a lot

646
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,360
of these tournaments had

647
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,120
over a hundred thousand dollars in prize

648
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,799
money who could predict

649
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,919
uh various brackets correctly and

650
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,760
a lot of these results for the games

651
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,200
that had taken place

652
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,960
ranking websites were publishing the

653
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,120
results before the game had been

654
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,000
streamed

655
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,200
allowing betters to place bets knowing

656
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,840
the result before the

657
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,520
game was actually officially streamed

658
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,440
which a lot of people found unfair

659
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,520
what was very funny though was to see

660
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,720
some of the resistance

661
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,360
to this online game cheating a youtuber

662
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,799
called scriptkit

663
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,039
decided to take revenge and created a

664
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,159
fake set of

665
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,320
cheats which people downloaded he

666
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,720
marketed this through google ads

667
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,039
and what would happen a cheater who was

668
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,320
using the software

669
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,720
during the game this fake software would

670
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,240
randomly hand out

671
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,000
punishments to the players that were

672
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
using it including

673
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,320
dropping bombs and mollies shooting

674
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,480
their teammates randomly starting to

675
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,679
spin

676
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,120
there were trigger points on certain

677
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,120
maps so that players will jump off the

678
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,320
map

679
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,720
some players would drop their guns and

680
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,760
in some cases

681
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,240
it would play a sound effect when the

682
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,120
player shoots

683
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,799
but wouldn't actually pull the trigger

684
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,960
of the weapon what we also saw

685
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,600
is the uk national crime agency taking

686
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,960
out adverts to

687
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,840
dissuade teenagers from buying stressor

688
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,880
or ddos

689
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,200
services in research published by

690
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,240
cambridge

691
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,600
it actually showed that there was a

692
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,679
remarkable decrease through these

693
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,640
campaigns

694
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
which i think is quite an interesting

695
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,080
initiative

696
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,840
so one of the big concerns over the past

697
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,080
year was with the rise of the pandemic

698
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,400
was that healthcare started to come

699
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,080
under attack

700
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,080
pharmaceutical companies started

701
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,840
investing large amounts of money into

702
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,039
vaccine research

703
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,120
there's over 100 vaccines currently in

704
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,320
development

705
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,440
and these are different types of

706
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,760
vaccines including sterilizing vaccines

707
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,080
and

708
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,559
functional immunity vaccines that work

709
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,880
in different ways

710
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,880
and what i've done is i've highlighted

711
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,480
some of the most prominent vaccine

712
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,159
candidates we have the two candidates

713
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,360
from russia

714
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,679
as well as a number of other countries

715
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,159
including moderna from the usa

716
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,000
the combined effort between the

717
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,840
university of oxford and astrazeneca

718
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,960
from the uk

719
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,000
phaser and by integ from the usa

720
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,600
johnson and johnson and emerging

721
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,440
biosolutions from the usa

722
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,320
and novavex also from the usa and some

723
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,120
of these

724
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,880
vaccines are currently being tested in

725
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,039
country we know from earlier this week

726
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,520
that the fisa vaccine has an

727
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,400
efficacy rate of 90 percent which is

728
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,799
unheard of most influenza

729
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,480
type vaccines like the flu shot

730
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,039
typically have an efficacy rate of

731
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,440
between 50 and 60 percent one of the

732
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,880
things that we know

733
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,720
at the moment is no matter who is first

734
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,799
to market there will be a supply

735
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,600
constraint various pharmaceutical

736
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,120
companies have mentioned that they'll be

737
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,559
able to manufacture

738
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,799
between 20 and 50 million volts of the

739
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:49,679
vaccine

740
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,080
and about a billion volts each

741
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,880
respectively next year

742
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,039
one of the challenges with the mrna

743
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:57,919
vaccines

744
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,640
like the fisa and modena vaccine is that

745
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,799
they need to be transported at very low

746
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:03,760
temperatures

747
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,679
and a lot of logistics chains cannot

748
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,120
actually handle that

749
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,679
as we have seen with the vaccine

750
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:10,799
development

751
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,559
we've also seen a massive rise in

752
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,720
the attacks against these pharmaceutical

753
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,559
companies

754
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,679
resulting in the ncsc and caesar

755
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,679
issuing a joint statement about these

756
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,279
attacks from

757
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,600
nation state actors you can imagine on

758
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,039
the global stage

759
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,679
various nations want to be the first to

760
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,960
have a vaccine

761
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,400
and does have issue tasking to the

762
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,440
intelligence agencies to get this

763
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,200
information especially

764
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,679
information relating to the vaccine

765
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,600
itself and how it's produced so that if

766
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,720
they need to get any

767
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,240
ingredients they are able to to do that

768
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,640
some of the most common forms of these

769
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,200
attacks were spearfishing campaigns

770
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,520
posits praying with credential stuffing

771
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,240
as well

772
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,279
as exploitation of known vulnerabilities

773
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,240
on on various systems and devices dhs

774
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,799
published a list of 25 vulnerabilities

775
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,200
which

776
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,600
are the most exploited by nation state

777
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,039
access for example

778
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,480
chinese apt-28 and i think it's shameful

779
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
that eight of these vulnerabilities

780
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,279
are security products so nation-state

781
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:19,840
actors

782
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,279
are exploiting vulnerabilities in

783
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,960
software and hardware which is meant to

784
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,039
keep an organization safe

785
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,200
yet they are being used as an invector

786
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
in order to break into

787
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,000
a company so we saw charges being filed

788
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,600
against chinese

789
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,240
state actors they are alleged to have

790
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
broken into a number of companies around

791
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:40,720
the world

792
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,840
across various industries and they also

793
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,880
have been alleged to have broken into

794
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,960
some companies to seal covert 19

795
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,760
research

796
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,799
so what we started to see was a rise

797
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,080
in ransomware attacks that were targeted

798
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,039
at hospitals

799
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,520
a patient died in a german hospital

800
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,840
after they were hit with ransomware

801
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,559
his treatment was delayed which resulted

802
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,640
in him passing away

803
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,720
many ransomware gangs actually came out

804
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,679
quite publicly

805
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,520
saying that they won't attack hospitals

806
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,919
however many attacks still took place

807
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,760
across europe the uk

808
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,360
us and other countries as well and this

809
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,000
led

810
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,200
obviously to a slew of jokes that if you

811
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,000
attack a us hospital that's a very good

812
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,399
way

813
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,279
to get vandal droned so the next theme

814
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,200
was contact tracing so

815
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,440
as the virus started to spread people

816
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,559
wanted to

817
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,720
start linking infections between people

818
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,880
and that is typically through forms and

819
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,000
surveys

820
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,080
the server that i'm showing you yeah is

821
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,360
the server that you

822
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,960
need to complete if you travel

823
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,039
internationally however

824
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,159
many of these forms were hosted

825
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,880
on websites or were using products where

826
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,159
the data

827
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,919
potentially sensitive data was not

828
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,440
actually in

829
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,120
wasn't secured properly so many contact

830
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,000
tracing solutions

831
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,080
were proposed which mainly fell into two

832
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,080
categories a decentralized approach and

833
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,679
a centralized approach

834
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,880
one of the big challenges with this was

835
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,080
how to collect these tokens in a privacy

836
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,600
preserving way

837
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,279
apple and google formed a joint

838
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,039
initiative to work on

839
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,279
a privacy preserving contact tracing

840
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,120
solution together

841
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,200
and they did this through the exposure

842
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,880
api which is compatible

843
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,200
on both of their platforms the system

844
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,240
relies on cryptography to ensure that

845
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,559
maximum privacy is attained

846
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,480
the system works by broadcasting a

847
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,080
random id

848
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,320
from the person's device which also then

849
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,159
collects these various ids of other

850
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,240
devices that it interacts with

851
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,919
and records the time and distance

852
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,039
between them if a user tests positive

853
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,080
for covert 19 or is unwell they can flag

854
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,919
themselves with the token

855
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,480
which is then uploaded to the service

856
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,120
various

857
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,440
user devices then download these tokens

858
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,520
and look for other tokens that they may

859
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,000
have interacted with if the token

860
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,159
matches the app calculates a risk

861
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,200
score and then lets the user know that

862
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,720
they should probably

863
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,880
be tested because they have come into

864
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,760
contact with an

865
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,000
infected person some of the challenges

866
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,399
around the contact tracing solution was

867
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,520
concerns around

868
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,679
how trolls may abuse the reporting

869
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:26,559
functions

870
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,120
in the various apps in a centralized

871
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,880
approach the collection of sensitive

872
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,120
data such as location data

873
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,279
could be misused for other purposes not

874
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,360
related to contact tracing

875
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,399
and as contact tracing started to

876
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,960
happen contact tracers started calling

877
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,080
people

878
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,600
letting them know that they had come

879
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,919
into contact with somebody that was

880
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:50,799
infected

881
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,120
however there was no way of knowing if

882
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,480
you were actually speaking to a

883
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,320
legitimate contact tracer

884
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,200
something which various scammers took

885
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,559
advantage of

886
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,120
to extract sensitive data out of people

887
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,039
especially the elderly

888
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,640
there were also there was also

889
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,399
interesting fail where

890
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,039
16 000 covert cases went unreported in

891
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,000
the uk

892
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
because officials exceeded the excel

893
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,679
spreadsheet limit

894
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,640
so next is malware and ransomware in

895
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,080
2019 we saw an

896
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,240
increasing sophistication of threat

897
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,360
capabilities

898
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,360
with many exploits using multi-stage

899
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,480
attacks

900
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,559
emitted and trickbots still remain some

901
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,559
of the most commonly

902
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,039
found and deploying malware currently

903
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,799
the number of malware families have

904
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,799
actually decreased over the past year

905
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,399
but there has been a significant

906
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,880
increase in ransomware attacks

907
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,039
one of the interesting trends is that

908
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,200
attacks are actually now starting to be

909
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,159
staged

910
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,799
so what ransomware gangs would do is

911
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,360
they would infect an organization

912
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,799
using droppers in malware and

913
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,120
they would wait until multiple people

914
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,360
had been infected before actually

915
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,919
triggering the ransomware to actually

916
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:02,880
encrypt

917
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,200
data this way they can actually encrypt

918
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,799
a lot of data before

919
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,720
an incident response team would be able

920
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
to isolate it

921
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,000
and a lot of incident response

922
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,320
playbooks assume that one device gets

923
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,679
infected at a time

924
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,640
however it would be quite a problem if

925
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,159
multiple devices started

926
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,600
encrypting and encrypting files at the

927
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,080
same time

928
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,960
and edward and bioware is not a big

929
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,720
problem

930
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,600
so the way that emittet typically works

931
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,480
is it would

932
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,760
send malicious attachments through mail

933
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,799
spam

934
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,000
and these emails typically contain a

935
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,240
malicious office document or a link

936
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,159
to a malicious office file that users

937
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,039
are told to download onto their pcs

938
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,440
so the way that this would work is

939
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,120
someone would get a file they would open

940
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,519
it there would be macros in the

941
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,760
document they would then open it and

942
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,360
enable macros

943
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,320
and then the malware would would execute

944
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
and would infect the machine

945
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,880
one of the things that we saw back in

946
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,080
2018 was that when

947
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,159
immates infected a system it would go

948
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,679
download a number of other

949
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,480
malware families as well one of them was

950
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,519
trickbot which

951
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,919
is a banking trojan which would steal

952
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,679
credentials of system by harvesting

953
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:22,640
emails

954
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,840
and by using memory cats however

955
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840
in the beginning at the beginning of

956
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,320
this year we started to see that imitate

957
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,039
would only deliver trick bots and this

958
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,039
time trickbot wasn't just a banking

959
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:35,760
trojan

960
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,840
it was also dropping ransomware in many

961
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,880
cases

962
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,039
and there was an interesting case where

963
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,279
a vigilante was actually sabotaging the

964
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,880
emitted botnet by

965
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,880
replacing a lot of the malware payloads

966
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,159
with gifs

967
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,080
now a lot of these malware payloads are

968
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,919
actually stored on hacked wordpress

969
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:52,799
sites

970
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,159
and these temporary hosting locations

971
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,320
are actually the achilles hill of

972
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,440
immated so

973
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,240
it was interesting to see this happening

974
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,240
and with the u.s elections there was

975
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,440
growing concern that

976
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,360
the trickbot botnet would be used to

977
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,440
interfere with u.s elections

978
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,080
so we saw action taken by cyber command

979
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,120
and microsoft

980
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,320
to take down the trickbot.net microsoft

981
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,960
used copyright and trade

982
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,760
mark law to disable 120 of the 128 known

983
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,440
command and control servers

984
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,840
this took out 94 of the trick bot

985
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,120
infrastructure

986
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,399
what we also saw was an unusual

987
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,279
move by the nsa to drop a report on new

988
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,679
linux malware that they had found from

989
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,799
the russian gru apt-28

990
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,519
otherwise known as fenty bear their

991
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,440
malware is called driver rub which is

992
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,760
seen as the cream of the crop

993
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,799
with regards to linux malware it is seen

994
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,559
as the swiss army knife for hacking

995
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,559
intellinix because it provides

996
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,960
full privileged backdoor access to linux

997
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,840
systems

998
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,679
we also saw some action from microsoft

999
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,760
where they removed 18 azure 80 apps that

1000
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,519
were being used by chinese

1001
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,679
state-sponsored hackers we also saw in

1002
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,360
october that charges were filed against

1003
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:07,679
six

1004
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,320
russian military intelligence officers

1005
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,159
for intrusion into multiple computer

1006
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,599
systems around the world

1007
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,199
this included attacks against the

1008
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,280
olympics the french elections and

1009
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,040
attacks against the ukraine government

1010
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,560
and infrastructure

1011
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,960
they are also alleged to be behind the

1012
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,480
global not picture ransomware campaign

1013
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,199
we also saw charges being filed against

1014
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,480
the chinese attackers from the company

1015
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,199
chengdu-404 otherwise

1016
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,639
known as apt-41 this company

1017
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,040
provided pen testing and other white hat

1018
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,639
type security services

1019
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,079
however they are alleged to have

1020
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,399
participated in state-sponsored attacks

1021
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,199
including

1022
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,520
attacks in the united states france

1023
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,679
japan singapore and south korea

1024
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,918
in a rare instance we actually started

1025
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,918
to see russian businesses

1026
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,239
also getting attacked with ransomware

1027
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,720
now it's an unofficial rule in the cyber

1028
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,440
underground

1029
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,640
world to not attack former soviet space

1030
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,480
in fact a lot of ransom where malware

1031
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,640
will actually check whether they are in

1032
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,800
a cis country these are countries that

1033
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,440
are formerly part of the soviet union

1034
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,560
which includes

1035
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,800
belarus ukraine kazakhstan and pakistan

1036
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,960
and what would happen is the malwa would

1037
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,160
check the

1038
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,880
time zone location and country that it

1039
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,520
was in

1040
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,079
and if it found itself in one of these

1041
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,839
countries the malware actually

1042
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,040
wouldn't infect the the computer that it

1043
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,880
was on

1044
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,880
one of the leading theories is that

1045
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,640
whoever's behind this ransomware

1046
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,520
campaign

1047
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,280
actually lives in one of the cis

1048
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,599
countries but doesn't live in russia and

1049
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,119
is actually trying to

1050
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,440
use this to get back at russia in some

1051
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,440
way but that's just a theory at this

1052
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,560
point in time

1053
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,400
so one of the big ransomware attacks

1054
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,920
that took place over the past year was

1055
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,280
the attack on gorman

1056
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,839
the attack started on the 23rd of july

1057
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,440
and knocked out a whole bunch of these

1058
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,400
services

1059
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,160
including fitness tracking services

1060
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,440
customer support

1061
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,160
and commercial aviation offerings there

1062
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,240
are conflicting reports about exactly

1063
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,480
what ransomware family was used

1064
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,400
however it is believed that the tridex

1065
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,720
malware was used to deliver

1066
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,359
the wasted locker ransomware into the

1067
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,480
environment

1068
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
the initial infection mechanism was a

1069
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,240
draft by compromise where

1070
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,359
it is alleged that somebody downloaded

1071
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,880
a fake file or potentially for a browser

1072
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,440
and this

1073
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,440
then triggered the random way to execute

1074
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,880
in the environment

1075
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,800
gorman paid a 10 million dollar

1076
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,520
ransomway

1077
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,880
government paid a 10 million dollar

1078
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,280
ransom either directly or indirectly

1079
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,560
through a third party

1080
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,000
and in doing so violated u.s sanctions

1081
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
so after this happened the office of

1082
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,320
foreign assets and control in the u.s

1083
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,160
issued a statement effectively banning

1084
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,800
ransomware payments to the sanctioned

1085
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,400
entities which includes

1086
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,320
evil corp cryptolocker wannacry and

1087
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,599
samsung

1088
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,599
these uh if a company pays a ransom they

1089
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,240
can

1090
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,040
face both civil and criminal penalties

1091
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,359
um

1092
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,359
up to 1 million dollars and 20 years in

1093
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,720
prison but

1094
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,240
wall sanctions really work i don't

1095
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,160
believe that they will making something

1096
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,839
illegal hasn't stopped it from happening

1097
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,359
if we just look at corruption tax

1098
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,240
evasion

1099
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,079
and the drug war making something

1100
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,760
illegal really hasn't stopped it from

1101
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,960
happening

1102
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,960
and we need to look at the case of

1103
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,280
paying for ransom versus the case

1104
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,960
against paying for ransom

1105
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,720
now if a company finds itself in the

1106
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,880
situation where all of its data and

1107
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,320
systems are encrypted

1108
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,280
and its business depends on having that

1109
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,160
data

1110
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,880
and systems available it could

1111
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,560
potentially go out of business

1112
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,640
which would lead to a loss of tax

1113
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,079
revenue for the state

1114
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,240
and a loss of jobs and if the payments

1115
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,800
for if a payment is made

1116
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,119
under duress that is under the threats

1117
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,640
of life there's an interesting

1118
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,880
self-defense argument that could be made

1119
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,119
since a corporation is a separate legal

1120
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:05,920
entity

1121
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,720
it has similar rights to a person

1122
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,359
therefore

1123
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,160
if it is threatened it has the right to

1124
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,359
self-defense

1125
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,280
and that could be an interesting legal

1126
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,599
argument to be made in court

1127
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,240
and this could potentially lead to jury

1128
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,200
sympathy if a jury trial

1129
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,480
occurs for criminal charges however

1130
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,760
they would argue that payments may lead

1131
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,079
to

1132
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,599
additional attacks taking place

1133
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,760
the potential national security risk and

1134
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,440
that the people that be

1135
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,760
are behind these attacks may actually

1136
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,040
use the funding

1137
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,599
to continue their campaigns against

1138
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,880
other companies

1139
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,040
another big theme of 2020 was the

1140
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,160
insider threat

1141
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,200
so earlier this year we saw a number of

1142
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,440
twitter accounts getting compromised

1143
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,440
so on the 15th of july a number of

1144
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,040
accounts were compromised

1145
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,560
and messages were posted directing

1146
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,520
people to pay

1147
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,160
bitcoin started to appear initially

1148
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,240
these tweets contained a url which

1149
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,920
contained instructions on where to send

1150
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,040
bitcoin

1151
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,960
um once that's out was taken down these

1152
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,079
attackers

1153
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,240
pivoted to tweeting out the bitcoin

1154
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,920
address where bitcoin should be sent you

1155
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,320
know

1156
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,240
if you send me some bitcoin i'll send

1157
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,920
you double in return

1158
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,480
and popular accounts such as jeff bezos

1159
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,079
bill gates kanye west

1160
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,240
elon musk apple and uber amongst many

1161
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,000
others were targeted

1162
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,760
when this happened i initially thought

1163
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,400
that this was the result of some kind of

1164
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,760
third party breach

1165
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,440
at the beginning of the year we saw a

1166
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,760
number of nfl teams

1167
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,440
twitter accounts getting compromised

1168
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,000
because they were using a third-party

1169
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,960
social media analytics company whose

1170
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,680
infrastructure was compromised and that

1171
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,160
that infrastructure was then used to

1172
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,280
take over these

1173
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,320
various twitter accounts however

1174
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,640
it actually turned out that a number of

1175
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,520
twitter

1176
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,960
employees were actually socially

1177
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,960
engineered and that access

1178
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,400
that they managed to gain through the

1179
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,560
social engineering was used to gain

1180
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,319
access to their systems

1181
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:09,440
twitter had a tool where where people

1182
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,640
could go read other

1183
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,839
um so twitter had an internal tool that

1184
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,119
would allow

1185
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,839
the internal staff members to read other

1186
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,599
people's data including

1187
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,200
performing functions like password

1188
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,640
resets the

1189
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,400
password to this internal tool was

1190
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,560
actually published on a slack channel

1191
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:26,960
which

1192
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,280
the these attackers managed to gain

1193
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,400
access to

1194
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,800
um and as part of the attacks over a

1195
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,920
hundred and thirty

1196
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,760
twitter accounts were targeted with

1197
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,400
these tweets at the count had the data

1198
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,000
downloaded from twitter

1199
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,119
and this resulted in 426 bitcoin

1200
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,160
transfers

1201
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,240
were processed to the address mentioned

1202
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,359
in the tweets

1203
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,560
um and that total 12

1204
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,599
around 13 bitcoins with a total value of

1205
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,520
117 000

1206
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,720
and i think given the enormity of this

1207
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,800
situation i think 117

1208
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,000
000 is is really peanuts there could

1209
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,640
have been

1210
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,599
much worse things happen happening with

1211
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,040
the access that was

1212
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,920
gained through through through this tool

1213
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,119
the way that the attackers were found

1214
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,240
is that a joint investigation by the fbi

1215
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,040
secret service and irs was conducted and

1216
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,400
the fbi used

1217
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,920
its copy of the og user's forum database

1218
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,400
which had been hijacked by a rival form

1219
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,440
a few months before and by combining

1220
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,680
that data with some chat logs

1221
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,040
they managed to track down graham clock

1222
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,720
who was 17 at the time

1223
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,720
he's the main accused or the mastermind

1224
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,319
behind these attacks

1225
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,480
graham was already known to law

1226
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,960
enforcement because he had participated

1227
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,880
in various sim-swapping

1228
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,880
activities and had recruit over a

1229
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,240
million dollars

1230
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,920
and was living by himself in an

1231
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,520
apartment in florida

1232
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,440
he was granted bail of seven hundred and

1233
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,040
twenty-five thousand dollars

1234
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,599
his co-conspirators were charged it's

1235
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,200
unclear at this point whether graham

1236
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,640
will be charged as a minor

1237
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,640
or an as an adult so one of the other

1238
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,040
insider threats that occurred was the

1239
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,839
attack on tesla where a russian citizen

1240
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,440
had migrated to

1241
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,440
the u.s and was working legally for

1242
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,359
tesla in their nevada

1243
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,079
factory then another russian citizen

1244
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:24,960
approached

1245
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,760
this russian migrant with an offer of a

1246
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,839
million dollars to plant ransomware onto

1247
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,040
tesla's network

1248
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,960
which would be done directly through a

1249
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,400
usb drive

1250
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,599
and when this attack took place the

1251
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:38,560
ransomware

1252
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,880
gang would perform a ddos attack against

1253
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,599
tesla

1254
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,880
to distract the security team while the

1255
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,440
the ransomware was actually running

1256
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,920
however the employee went to management

1257
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,119
uh after this had happened tesla called

1258
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,280
in the fbi and this employee with the

1259
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,079
fbi

1260
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,960
then set up a sting operation where this

1261
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,280
uh

1262
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,839
this person was arrested and has now

1263
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,160
subsequently been charged

1264
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,720
another big theme of 2020 was

1265
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,319
disinformation

1266
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,720
so 2020 was really a train wreck of

1267
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,720
issues we had a global pandemic

1268
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,160
a u.s elections mass global protests

1269
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,440
around racism

1270
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,839
police brutality and climate change

1271
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:20,560
really led

1272
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,520
itself to becoming a melting pot of

1273
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,200
issues which could be

1274
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,040
used to spread misinformation and

1275
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,480
disinformation

1276
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,000
what we've seen with this information

1277
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,599
since the 2016 election

1278
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,839
is that the number of pages and accounts

1279
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,839
spreading this information has increased

1280
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:36,880
sharply

1281
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,119
typically these disinformation campaigns

1282
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,720
are often created by

1283
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,359
nation state actors mainly to interfere

1284
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,440
with the politics of other countries

1285
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,800
however increasingly

1286
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,319
some of this this information is

1287
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,240
actually being created by other groups

1288
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,599
with other interests

1289
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,119
and not just governments in 2016 we know

1290
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,800
from the mallory reports how russia

1291
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,839
used advertising to spread information

1292
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,319
and it's easy to think that this this

1293
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,480
information pandemic is only

1294
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,760
or the epidemic is only related to

1295
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,000
the us however there are many other

1296
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,040
countries

1297
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,520
that are being targeted as well in

1298
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,319
myanmar

1299
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,000
the government used facebook and

1300
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,520
instagram to share

1301
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,000
highly inflammatory messages a lot of

1302
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,720
the content

1303
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,280
used emotional imagery to spark an

1304
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,720
emotional response

1305
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,280
by those who see it many of these

1306
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,480
accounts will post

1307
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,280
popular content and celebrity gossip to

1308
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,640
build audiences

1309
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,480
once they have an audience they will

1310
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,040
then start sharing political messages

1311
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,119
what you also start to see is that a lot

1312
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,240
of these accounts

1313
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,319
share information in a highly

1314
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:45,839
coordinated way

1315
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,119
and these pages then start building very

1316
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,880
significant audiences as they go with us

1317
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,640
we also see a common tactic where

1318
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,359
where pages will steal photos and

1319
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,599
profile photos from other users

1320
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,200
and pages tracking the links between all

1321
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,079
of these domains can be quite a

1322
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,319
quite a hard thing to do and there's a

1323
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:11,680
number of researchers that have been

1324
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,280
tracking the links between all of the

1325
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,240
domains

1326
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,800
not only can this be quite difficult but

1327
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,520
it can be quite

1328
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,560
helpful to link domains and the actors

1329
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,440
that are behind them

1330
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,240
what we started to see as well with the

1331
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,280
us elections

1332
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,680
is the rise of information operations so

1333
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,680
we saw information operations from

1334
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,480
russia

1335
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,040
china and iran trying to interfere with

1336
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,400
the us election

1337
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,319
what we saw russia doing was they

1338
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,800
created a website called peace data

1339
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,480
where they used freelance journalists to

1340
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,480
write stories and then published

1341
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,119
them using fake names and accounts these

1342
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,040
accounts were then created using

1343
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,920
fake profile photos which were generated

1344
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,560
using artificial intelligence

1345
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,839
and another website called the newsroom

1346
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,800
for american and european based citizens

1347
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,240
was also created

1348
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,720
and once this came to the attention of

1349
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,760
the various

1350
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,720
social media platforms these accounts

1351
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,319
were suspended and links

1352
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,640
to these websites were also prohibited

1353
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,680
from being shared

1354
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,920
we also saw the story about spartan

1355
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,200
secret emails

1356
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,520
which is actually a story planted by

1357
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,720
russian

1358
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,920
officials against rudy giuliani what we

1359
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,440
also saw previously

1360
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,680
is that q anon likes to spread

1361
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,040
conspiracy theories

1362
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,880
they have subsequently been declared a

1363
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,720
domestic terrorism threat

1364
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,160
um previously we saw conspiracies

1365
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,920
including human trafficking rings

1366
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,760
alleged criminal activities

1367
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,800
and anti-vaxx movements these

1368
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,680
conspiracies

1369
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,920
have led to people committing real

1370
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,720
crimes

1371
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,920
such as shootings and kidnappings with

1372
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,119
the belief that they are actually

1373
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:51,920
helping

1374
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,560
the cause and one of these crimes

1375
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,359
included

1376
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:58,000
an innocent person who was portrayed as

1377
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,079
a mob boss who was completely innocent

1378
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,680
but then was gunned down by somebody

1379
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,319
that believed in the conspiracy

1380
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,720
and with the global pandemic a lot of

1381
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,960
the conspiracies

1382
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,680
are centered around covert 19. so yeah

1383
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,960
is just some examples

1384
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,440
of campaigns that we saw from mexico and

1385
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,400
spain against

1386
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,160
u.s elections and again these

1387
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,400
campaigns would often use popular images

1388
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,599
for engagements

1389
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,480
and other content to appear authentic so

1390
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,000
social media platforms got a lot of

1391
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,960
criticism from the 2016 u.s elections

1392
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,079
they have been quite decisive in 2020

1393
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,200
against taking actions against

1394
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,920
these disinformation campaigns one of

1395
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,760
the things that they also did was

1396
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,680
um they started placing labels on

1397
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,839
misleading content for example

1398
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,240
the election fraud allegations made by

1399
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,200
donald trump

1400
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,880
started to see labels

1401
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,359
being put on that it was misleading we

1402
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,599
as well as other tweets that were

1403
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,839
claiming the same thing one of the

1404
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,440
consequences of all of this

1405
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,520
information is that some of these

1406
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,440
conspiracy theories for example

1407
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,800
the 5g conspiracy theory that

1408
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,280
alleged that 5g infrastructure was led

1409
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,800
to the spread of the

1410
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,760
coronavirus led to some people in the uk

1411
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,960
actually setting

1412
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,200
cell phone towers alight even though

1413
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,000
some of them are not

1414
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,839
actually 5g towers and the uk has

1415
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,000
is treating this as a national security

1416
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,440
threat because

1417
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,599
not everybody has broadband access and

1418
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,119
relies on these towers

1419
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,839
as well as a lot of these towers support

1420
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,920
the esn network which is used by first

1421
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,839
responders

1422
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,079
and one of the big concerns that i have

1423
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,119
over the next year

1424
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,960
is that we're going to see a lot of

1425
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,760
disinformation and misinformation around

1426
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,640
covet 19 and sometimes it's not always

1427
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,400
intentional if we look at this example

1428
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,920
from the washington post

1429
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,319
depending on what twitter client you had

1430
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,040
you may

1431
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,760
have gotten a different version of this

1432
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,800
article

1433
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,240
so if you only read the tweet

1434
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,040
you would have thought that the oxford

1435
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,960
vaccine had killed somebody

1436
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,079
whereas if you actually saw the tweet

1437
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,280
with the headline

1438
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,760
you would have have seen that the person

1439
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,839
who died actually didn't get the vaccine

1440
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,359
they got a placebo

1441
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,319
and not the real vaccine thus the you

1442
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:20,720
know

1443
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,079
there shouldn't be anything to be

1444
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,079
concerned about so next up

1445
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,359
is the wechat and tick-tock ban so

1446
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,520
tick-tock has seen unprecedented growth

1447
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,200
over the past four years

1448
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,240
in 2004 it took facebook a year to get a

1449
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,520
million users

1450
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,160
in the same time period tick tock had

1451
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,440
met had managed to

1452
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,079
amass over 100 million users and has

1453
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:42,480
made

1454
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,040
its chinese parent company bike dance

1455
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,119
one of the most valuable companies in

1456
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,599
the world

1457
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,400
as tiktok became very popular a lot of

1458
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,640
rhetoric started to be thrown around

1459
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,640
regarding the privacy implications of

1460
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,400
tik tok there have been many

1461
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,800
posts claiming that user data is being

1462
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,200
harvested so the chinese government can

1463
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,920
use it in various nefarious ways and

1464
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,839
this is despite the fact that many other

1465
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,599
social media apps like

1466
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,880
facebook reddit twitter linkedin

1467
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,440
and instagram collects the same amount

1468
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,680
of data and in some cases even more data

1469
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,160
than

1470
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,200
tick tock is collecting and yes the

1471
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,200
chinese national intelligence law is

1472
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,400
often cited as

1473
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,160
one of the big concerns with tick tock

1474
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,880
so tik tok has grown very quickly in

1475
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,800
india before protest demanded that tik

1476
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,720
tok be banned so that local apps can

1477
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,520
grow

1478
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,079
india has also since india has since

1479
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,839
banned several other chinese apps

1480
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,280
including wechat

1481
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,280
these privacy concerns have led to many

1482
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,119
companies banning tiktok from their

1483
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,160
devices

1484
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,920
and this includes the us military

1485
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,920
branches

1486
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,319
donald trump has spread a lot of

1487
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,160
disinformation around tik tok and has

1488
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,800
tried to use the cfs and

1489
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,599
iepa laws to ban both tick tock and

1490
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,280
wechat from the us

1491
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,359
there's a lot of legal action currently

1492
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:06,880
going on about this

1493
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,359
it's unclear why this is the case but it

1494
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:10,640
seems that

1495
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,040
this is linked to his trade war against

1496
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,079
china

1497
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:17,920
and tick tock users also sabotaged the

1498
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,119
attendance on foreign rallies by

1499
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,880
registering that they would attend but

1500
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,559
then obviously not actually going to the

1501
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:25,119
event

1502
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:27,119
and this may have upset trump to a

1503
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,319
certain degree

1504
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,680
i don't normally use memes in my

1505
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,119
presentation but i thought this one to

1506
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:32,160
be quite funny

1507
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,760
which says if you want to steal my data

1508
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,680
you have to be a us-based

1509
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,000
corporation and one of the arguments for

1510
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,240
the wechat ban is that

1511
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,240
that u.s interests need to be looked

1512
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,359
after and if

1513
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:46,559
tick-tock is a growing company that is a

1514
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,079
non-us company and

1515
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,680
should be stopped so one of the

1516
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,680
conditions for

1517
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,000
tick-tock to continue working in the u.s

1518
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,040
is that

1519
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,119
some of the operations need to be taken

1520
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,800
over by a u.s company

1521
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,559
and tick-tock has by year's company

1522
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,760
and oracle has agreed to be ticktock's

1523
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,960
official

1524
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,359
technology partner which spawned a lot

1525
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,200
of jokes about oracle cloud got

1526
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,400
gets its first customer uh

1527
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,480
and also the fact that donald trump is

1528
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,400
the oracle cloud sales person of the

1529
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,440
year

1530
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,240
and what also then came out was that

1531
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,000
oracle's larry ellison

1532
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,760
had actually donated 250 000

1533
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,960
to lindsey graham super pac days before

1534
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,720
the tick tock deal

1535
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,720
went through which obviously is no big

1536
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,598
surprise there

1537
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,079
the next theme that i would like to talk

1538
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,079
about is satellite security

1539
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:43,680
so a large part of the world's

1540
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,520
population lacks

1541
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,680
access to high-speed internet something

1542
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,240
which the pandemic really demonstrated

1543
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,800
and in order to solve the spacex is

1544
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,160
planning to have

1545
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,319
12 000 satellites in low earth orbit

1546
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,000
within the next

1547
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,240
69 years with plans for further

1548
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,599
expansion up to 42

1549
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,920
000 satellites in the future currently

1550
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,400
spacex can manufacture and launch

1551
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,599
60 satellites every two weeks but

1552
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,119
this does bring up an interesting

1553
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,040
question around

1554
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,720
what would the network of the future

1555
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,559
potentially look like

1556
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,800
are satellites potentially going to be

1557
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,280
the new network edge in the future

1558
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,920
and because these satellites are in low

1559
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,760
earth orbit they can actually achieve

1560
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,400
lower latencies than some of the fiber

1561
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,839
optic cables today

1562
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:33,040
so if we look at the latency between

1563
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,119
london and johannesburg currently on

1564
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,200
fiber that's about 90 seconds

1565
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,359
where on satellite that could be as low

1566
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:40,960
as 77

1567
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,240
milliseconds this obviously depends

1568
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,079
quite heavily on weather conditions so

1569
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:47,680
as part of the starlink

1570
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,559
program it has seen 15 launches with 13

1571
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,720
of those launches taking place this year

1572
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,760
which has delivered 895 satellites

1573
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,319
into orbit it has been amazing to see

1574
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,760
how quickly spacex

1575
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,400
has been able to launch these rockets in

1576
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,240
the past you would only typically see a

1577
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,079
handful of launchers every year

1578
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,240
and as an f geek it's really great to

1579
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,359
see how fast

1580
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,520
they are being able to launch these

1581
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,480
rockets

1582
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,640
so far this year we've already seen 21

1583
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,599
launches

1584
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,319
and only two failed landing attempts in

1585
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,319
june there were a total of four launches

1586
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:21,040
we had

1587
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,079
the nasa crew demo 2 mission and then

1588
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:25,359
two starlink missions

1589
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:28,000
and then a gps mission followed after

1590
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,960
that

1591
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,200
and on the day of this conference the

1592
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,280
first official crew mission from nasa

1593
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,160
will actually

1594
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,760
be launching late in the evening

1595
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,359
so satellite security is not something

1596
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,520
that has had seen a lot of attention in

1597
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,480
the past

1598
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,559
um something which the aerospace village

1599
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,799
at defcon wants it to change

1600
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:49,760
and they hosted a hackersat contest with

1601
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,200
a prize of 50

1602
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,680
dollars so qualification rounds took

1603
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,160
place after which teams had to complete

1604
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,160
uh several challenges so teams were

1605
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,880
given their own flat set to test code on

1606
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,559
there was a room where the satellites

1607
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:04,559
were orbiting inside the room

1608
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,799
and these flat sets were sitting in a

1609
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:07,760
carousel

1610
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,520
and were sitting on air supported

1611
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,359
bearings so that the attitude control

1612
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,160
systems

1613
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,920
could keep the satellite in the right

1614
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,760
orientation

1615
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,160
so these these flat sets were running a

1616
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,920
core flight system that was developed by

1617
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,559
nasa

1618
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,319
and the winning team managed to run

1619
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,480
their code on a real world satellite

1620
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,559
which is alleged to be the error cube

1621
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:27,520
10b

1622
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,839
satellite which was launched in 2019

1623
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,000
so moving on to the last theme of the

1624
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,160
year which is around encryption

1625
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,520
so last year we saw 90 of the internet

1626
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,480
is encrypted that's

1627
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,520
up to 95 today we know from the

1628
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,760
certificate transparency logs that last

1629
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,240
year

1630
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,480
we had over a billion valid certificates

1631
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,240
which was quite a milestone

1632
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,559
however the number of valid certificates

1633
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:53,359
has now

1634
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:56,400
declined to 700 million it's unclear

1635
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,240
whether the pandemic had any

1636
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,559
impact in this maybe people start

1637
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,880
creating certificates for the kubernetes

1638
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,920
containers

1639
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,559
we also saw a certificate issuance start

1640
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:09,760
to increase so

1641
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,599
in 2018 we saw 700 000 certificates

1642
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:15,839
being issued per day that increased to

1643
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,920
2.9 million certificates that were being

1644
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,040
issued per day

1645
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,079
we saw that increase in 2020 to 4.9

1646
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,680
million certificates being issued per

1647
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,240
day

1648
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,400
this means that the issuance rate has

1649
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,359
increased to 193 000 certificates

1650
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:32,000
per hour from a market share perspective

1651
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
latin crypt has increased its market

1652
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,920
share to 78

1653
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,680
with satiga formerly commodore dropping

1654
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,559
dropping down to 10 percent what we also

1655
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,319
saw is the increased adoption of

1656
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:46,160
elliptic curve cryptography

1657
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,400
so from 2018 it was 7

1658
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:54,160
2019 10 and in 2020 it's up to 17

1659
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,880
however um due to the rapid growth

1660
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,000
between 2018 and 2019

1661
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,359
even though percentage-wise it only

1662
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,799
increased by three percent it actually

1663
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,640
saw a five-fold increase in the number

1664
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,000
of certificates

1665
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,640
unfortunately many cloud services still

1666
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,079
don't support

1667
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:14,079
um elliptic curve yet we did see an

1668
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:15,839
interesting crypto bug being reported by

1669
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:16,880
the nsa

1670
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,520
in the windows crypto api dll which

1671
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,720
validates elliptic

1672
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,040
cryptography certificate which would

1673
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,799
allow an attacker to perform

1674
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:28,000
a man-in-the-middle attack in closing i

1675
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,680
would like to make some predictions for

1676
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,040
2021

1677
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,559
i mentioned earlier on i think we're

1678
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,559
going to see a huge amount of covert 19

1679
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,480
vaccine disinformation

1680
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,559
as budgets tighten with the economic

1681
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,160
situation that we have

1682
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,960
as security spend will decrease this

1683
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,799
will lead to larger and more complex

1684
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,160
ransomware attacks

1685
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,160
we'll continue to see advancements in

1686
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,440
xero trust

1687
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,599
tooling and software we'll see an

1688
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,520
increase in data breaches from

1689
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,160
manufacturers and retailers

1690
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,200
we'll see tls 1.3 bugs and other crypto

1691
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,040
bugs

1692
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,520
attackers will focus their attention on

1693
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,040
attacking the home

1694
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,200
we'll see the continued misuse of deep

1695
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,400
facts and other

1696
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,079
ai we'll see the increased adoption

1697
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:15,119
of cyber insurance and we'll see attacks

1698
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:15,640
