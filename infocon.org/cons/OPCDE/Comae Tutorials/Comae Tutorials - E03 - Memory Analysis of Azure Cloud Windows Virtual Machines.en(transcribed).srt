3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:12,530
hey everyone and welcome back to

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,269
Stardust for another tutorial video

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,980
today we'll learn how you can speed up

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:20,789
the investigation of your Windows

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,619
machines in Azure cloud first if you

8
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,170
don't already have a local copy of

9
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,830
koumei toolkit download a copy after

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,660
logging in to koumei stardust dashboard

11
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,910
extract the files and launch powershell

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,230
as administrator and navigate where the

13
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,230
koumei scripts are located

14
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,329
we will need the Microsoft AZ PowerShell

15
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,500
module to operate any of these or

16
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:47,960
commands

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,370
you can install it using the install

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,370
module AZ command

19
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,370
you

20
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:04,960
the next step is to log into your Azure

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:08,340
account via PowerShell using the login

22
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,339
AZ account command

23
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:18,820
if you cannot see your virtual machine

24
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:20,619
while using the get AZ VM command this

25
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,619
just means that you need to select the

26
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:25,990
appropriate Azure subscription to do so

27
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:29,140
use the get Azure subscription and

28
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,640
select AZ subscription commands just

29
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,630
pass the subscription name to the

30
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,630
command and that's it

31
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,529
now you should be able to see your

32
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:46,259
virtual machines when using the get AZ

33
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,170
VM command you can check again if you

34
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,810
can now access your virtual machine once

35
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,729
Azure access is configured you can now

36
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,429
import the koumei PowerShell module

37
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:58,890
using the import module command like

38
00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:01,140
we've seen in previous videos co-main

39
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,140
PowerShell module is open source and

40
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,140
available on github in this video the

41
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:11,160
command we will use is invoke kome AZ VM

42
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,680
when analyze AZ stands for Microsoft

43
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,599
Azure and the prefix aims at helping to

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,750
differentiate the commands from other

45
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,629
cloud providers such as AWS for Amazon

46
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,910
Web Services this command leverages the

47
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:27,120
run command feature available on Azure

48
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,829
Windows VMs a similar task can be

49
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,319
achieved for Azure Linux virtual

50
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:33,720
machines as we will cover in a future

51
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:36,358
video see the link in the video

52
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,400
description to learn more about it while

53
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:40,650
using the command you will need to

54
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,599
provide the virtual machine name its

55
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,359
resources group and your co-maid

56
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:47,179
credentials in this example we are

57
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:50,130
retrieving them from the user interface

58
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:53,040
just like in the previous videos your

59
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,720
co-maid client ID and client secret can

60
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,000
be found in the settings page under the

61
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,099
integrations tab in koumei Stardust

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,200
dashboard the command will now

63
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,540
automatically analyze your virtual

64
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,298
machine and then send the dump file to

65
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,280
Stardust for analysis you can recognize

66
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:11,840
the output of dump it command on the

67
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,840
remote Azure virtual machine

68
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,560
let's fast-forward to our dashboard to

69
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,560
see the results

70
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,420
we can now use the comb a Stardust

71
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,670
features to browse the image it shows

72
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:32,799
that one process is suspicious because

73
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,799
it's using token manipulation functions

74
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,379
you

75
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,710
we of course have access to the graph

76
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,170
view to visualize the relationship of

77
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:51,120
this process with other processes to

78
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:54,149
quickly identify if this is a false

79
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,430
positive or not last but not least the

80
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,440
report feature summarizes all the

81
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,170
artifacts found into a one-page document

82
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,480
and classify the malicious and

83
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:07,100
suspicious elements found by our

84
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,100
internal detection playbooks

85
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:13,190
that's it for today as you can see the

86
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,930
process is extremely easy and as more

87
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,449
and more companies are using cloud

88
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,880
infrastructures it is very important to

89
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:22,220
rethink how Incident Response is managed

90
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,590
and executed and this can partly be

91
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,360
achieved by intelligently leveraging

92
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,030
features offering by those cloud

93
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,280
providers even though many are already

94
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,888
offering security products for detection

95
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,840
the offering for Incident Response is

96
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:38,300
still very weak and lacking by those

97
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,580
cloud providers reference links can be

98
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,380
