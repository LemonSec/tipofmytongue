1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,970
I am sterile Kotani cybersecurity and

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:10,600
digital Citians Abraham investor

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:12,969
niversity we are here to present to you

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:17,529
our graduation project titled what's up

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:18,519
digger we are a group of four I'm Sarah

6
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:22,710
here are my colleagues

7
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:24,909
Malak diamond Lamia and for the for the

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,249
agenda we will have the we'll go through

9
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:29,560
this introduction the model and we will

10
00:00:27,249 --> 00:00:31,148
discuss some similar tools we will show

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,399
you a demonstration and we will show you

12
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:36,960
the what makes our to a special then

13
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:39,879
what are the places for improvements

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,789
okay first of all finding an idea

15
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:45,309
actually we are still students we're not

16
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:47,230
graduated yet we have two weeks ahead to

17
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:48,879
be officially graduated and now we are

18
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,940
in the middle of the finals so please

19
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,099
pray for us actually we were spending

20
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,160
the last summer looking for a problem to

21
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:59,230
adopt or to address and latterly we

22
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,529
annoy every information security expert

23
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,819
we know so some of our victims are here

24
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,910
in the hall thank you for your

25
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,470
cooperation but we settle down with the

26
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,179
problem that is reported to us by the

27
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:13,240
Department of Digital evidences in Saudi

28
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,040
Arabia they said that they are facing

29
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,060
difficulties while investigating lots of

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,830
cases and why what's up exactly not

31
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,660
other application because in Saudi

32
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,970
Arabia more than 80% of the crimes are

33
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,740
committed using whatsapp alone and this

34
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,160
is on the local level but in the global

35
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,229
level

36
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,869
whatsapp is accredited to be the highest

37
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,240
or the most used messaging application

38
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,830
ever so and there are a lot of research

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,259
indicate or pointing out the

40
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:41,770
relationship between using whatsapp and

41
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:43,210
the increase in the digital crimes so

42
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,130
for these two reasons the local and the

43
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,530
global we were determined to address

44
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,410
what subproblem can you go next okay

45
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,300
first of all before going deeper into

46
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,119
the problem I want to make sure that we

47
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:57,370
are on the same floor so I will explain

48
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,840
briefly the acquisition types are three

49
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,940
of the general acquisition types and

50
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,410
forensics

51
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,789
indicating that we in forensics care

52
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,509
about the integrity and the

53
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,830
admissibility of the evidences in record

54
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:12,790
firstly we have physical acquisition

55
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:14,920
where we try to endure the crime we try

56
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,660
to acquire the data

57
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,030
the suspect or the victim device and we

58
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,099
have a three method to do so either

59
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,500
physical acquisition where retrieve all

60
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:26,079
the binary representation of the data so

61
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,790
nothing is left in the device so even

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,959
the delivers will be acquired but the

63
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,790
problem with this product was

64
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,980
acquisition method is that it's takes

65
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,750
time and it's read to decode the data

66
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,380
and reconstruct the data again to be

67
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:40,390
easy for analysis secondly we have the

68
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,920
logical acquisition type the logic

69
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,768
logical acquisition differs than the

70
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,359
physical acquisition because it interact

71
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:49,150
with the file system level it doesn't go

72
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,300
deeper and it could acquire data of a

73
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,310
specific data object for example all the

74
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,280
pictures all the videos of the text and

75
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,230
so on but there is a difference of type

76
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,360
trauma two calls per equation it's the

77
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,600
same but the difference is that it could

78
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,190
retrieve the deleted files next the last

79
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,319
one which is the model acquisition which

80
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,650
is in the forensic field is the least

81
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,780
preferably methodology because here the

82
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,549
investigator showed up in the phone or

83
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,220
the computer manually and start

84
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:20,170
investigating and record the process

85
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,709
using a video cam so he will do it by

86
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:25,690
hand but that makes the that makes makes

87
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:27,190
the integrity of the data suspicious

88
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,799
because any mistakes happen could I

89
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,739
don't want the evidence integrity dating

90
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:36,190
emoji dating messages or so on but the

91
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:37,660
point of departure is that and during

92
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,420
the existing tool there are two

93
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:43,329
acquisition method regardless of the

94
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,820
general types there are some certified

95
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:48,340
tool I bet you hear about it like search

96
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,840
cellebrite and xri these are certified

97
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,820
tool by the whole world and they

98
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,590
generate reports that is certified by

99
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,870
the court but the problem with these

100
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,209
tool is that they have to acquire full

101
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,799
image of the mobile device so everything

102
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:01,930
in the new browser should be acquired

103
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:05,739
for a whatsapp case which at least takes

104
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:07,540
one and half day and then they start

105
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:09,819
searching for what what's up artifacts

106
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,650
because the acquisition using this tool

107
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:13,630
will mix everything together so we'll

108
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,790
have all whatsapp pictures with telegram

109
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,219
will snapchat all the text messages and

110
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,649
so on which requires you to filter out

111
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,660
related data and lastly you will start

112
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:25,060
analysis so it's like three-step process

113
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,310
but the better solution or the better

114
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,010
method for what sub cases so just

115
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,800
acquire what

116
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:33,530
files and you start investigating them

117
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,030
so we decided to adopt the second

118
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,010
acquisition method or the second

119
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:40,190
methodology and here is an overview

120
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:42,740
about the model we proposed and we

121
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,510
developed actually first of all simply

122
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,940
you just log in the suspect or the

123
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,530
victim device to the computer then you

124
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,780
will up in what sub digger forensic tool

125
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,210
this tool will be able to access your

126
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,090
phone to get the key for decrypting

127
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,080
what's up files because whatsapp

128
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,450
database was encrypted

129
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,830
and then will acquired what's up files

130
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,140
database and media folder and everything

131
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,510
then it will show it to you and easy

132
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:10,180
format for investigation and analysis

133
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:12,159
and an addition to provide investigating

134
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:16,250
methodologies or features such as

135
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,630
hashing searching reporting and many now

136
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,510
I will give the floor to my colleague

137
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:24,250
demo to talk about existing similar tool

138
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,250
and this just assertions on the plan

139
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:32,000
thank you Sarah for introducing me I'm

140
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:35,960
timid HIV I'll continue with the what's

141
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,750
up digger story actually after we after

142
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:43,430
we found the idea we just scan the field

143
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:46,580
for the for the existing tools with a

144
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:50,420
confidence that we want phone we won't

145
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:55,430
find any tool that extract the Watsa

146
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:59,360
files directly but this shock was we

147
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:02,210
found for which are you sob welcome soft

148
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,600
wet sub Explorer wet subkey database

149
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:09,049
extractor and salvation' what's a

150
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:11,270
salvation data what's up forensics after

151
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:14,150
being terrified for a while and thinking

152
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,520
about what we can do now we just

153
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:20,000
realized that this is actually an

154
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:23,140
opportunity to find the deficiencies in

155
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,980
the existing tools and improve it and

156
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:32,630
approve our tool strengths to provide

157
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:35,870
the field with useful tool to do so we

158
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:37,940
selected nest just assertions and test

159
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:41,720
applied and researchers the criteria to

160
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:43,520
analyze the tools the existing tools

161
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,070
okay let's start with the first aspect

162
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,460
which is nest mobile device tool test

163
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:54,580
assertions and test applied as we all

164
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:56,780
know that integrating standards and test

165
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:00,650
international international standards

166
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:03,469
and test the existing tools against

167
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,659
international test assertions highly

168
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:10,100
affect the tool certification and the

169
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:12,190
evidence admissibility and courts so we

170
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:15,500
selected must test assertions to compare

171
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:19,190
basically it is a general test

172
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:23,930
assertions that are related to all types

173
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:27,620
of forensics mobile devices tools that

174
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:32,860
aims to evaluate the how accurate is the

175
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,860
tool while acquiring the what's up data

176
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:39,320
basically it consists from two main

177
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:41,330
categories a core and optional week or

178
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:45,700
just assertion we focused more in the

179
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:47,960
coitus assertions the sense the optional

180
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,510
focus more in the physical acquisition

181
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:56,270
which is not used and the what's a

182
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:58,640
forensic field so there's ten test test

183
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,260
assertions court sister sessions refers

184
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:05,000
to three are similar in the sense that

185
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:08,419
they evaluate the the accuracy of the

186
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,460
acquired data but they are varying in

187
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:12,890
the scope of acquisition the first one

188
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,930
is related to acquire old acquire all

189
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:17,870
means acquire all the data in the mobile

190
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,790
device so FB tool provides the option of

191
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:25,729
acquire all the data that will must

192
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:28,280
succeed to with this acquisition mr.

193
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:30,860
contesta assertions are similar but with

194
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:35,299
the scope is select all select all means

195
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:37,190
here that selects all the data objects

196
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:39,620
related to one data type like selecting

197
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:44,720
all the pictures related to picture data

198
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:47,720
type okay the third some similar to the

199
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,930
previous but selected objects here the

200
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,910
difference as selected objects like

201
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:54,560
selected pictures from the picture type

202
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:58,100
itself so like

203
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,839
be acquiring the pictures related to

204
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,440
whatsapp application from the whole

205
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:05,000
pictures stored in the mobile device

206
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,190
this is the only one that is applicable

207
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,760
to what sufferance they can be previous

208
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:14,510
arena applicable before it is related to

209
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,460
the interruption of the tool if if there

210
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:19,370
is an interruption between the mobile

211
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,930
device and the the tool the tool must

212
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,510
notify the user that there is an

213
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:27,020
interruption happened and the user can

214
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:29,930
take an action as you can see here this

215
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:33,319
is an example from whatsapp digger if an

216
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:35,449
interruption or if the tape cable is Ana

217
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,950
blanked what's a bigger will show this

218
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:46,520
error or alert message to the user that

219
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:50,450
you can reblock the cable again okay the

220
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:53,360
test assertions related to review the

221
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:56,870
acquired data so the tool must be able

222
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,060
to provide a preview pane or generated

223
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,510
reports about to be acquired data like

224
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,849
here in a media folder is acquired from

225
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:10,819
whatsapp dagur here is the content of

226
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:13,160
the media folder ok these texts related

227
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,440
to providing information about the

228
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,620
connected device like the IMEI the

229
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:25,250
serial number the Virgin the software

230
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:28,970
version as you can see here the 7th is

231
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:31,310
related to the usability of information

232
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,700
or the data acquired so the data instead

233
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:36,920
of just presenting dummy data and

234
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:39,320
thumbnails of pictures the tool must be

235
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,360
present useful into information so the

236
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:46,180
investigator can easily investigate the

237
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:49,130
cases ok the 8th is related to the

238
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,529
non-latin characters like to be Chinese

239
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:55,040
like Arabic characters so the tool must

240
00:10:51,529 --> 00:11:01,089
be able to to show the non-latin

241
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:04,040
characters in a native form the event

242
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:07,459
testosteron is related to the hashing so

243
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,240
the acquired data must be hushed and it

244
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,099
will must

245
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,709
provide hash value for the acquired data

246
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:16,339
either for specific data objects or for

247
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:18,709
the overall case file and the last test

248
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:21,560
assertions related to the modification

249
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:24,560
of the investigator modified the

250
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,020
acquired data using third-party tools

251
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,170
like a hex editors or anything then

252
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:33,550
reopen this project with the V tool the

253
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:37,819
tool must be able to detect such

254
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:39,979
modification and as you can see here is

255
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,529
the result of the comparison the most

256
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:46,000
important colors here is the green and

257
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:50,260
the orange the green means that the tool

258
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,110
passed such a test assertion and the

259
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:57,110
orange means that the this tool failed

260
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:59,110
with this just assertion and as you can

261
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:03,560
see there is no existing tool that

262
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:04,880
passed all the tests assertions here it

263
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,219
comes - what's up digger which is our

264
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,920
tool that passed all the applicable so

265
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,930
as I mentioned v2 the first tool is not

266
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,069
applicable for what Scott's up cases in

267
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:18,620
general okay

268
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:21,310
as we said that nest just assertions are

269
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:25,310
general for all types of forensics

270
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:27,770
devices we had to select or define more

271
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:30,229
specific criteria like research other

272
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:34,579
criteria to get a comprehensive view

273
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:38,140
about the existing tools which will be

274
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:38,140
explained by my colleague Malak

275
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:51,010
okay hello thank you Dima for

276
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:53,620
introducing me I'm like this here and

277
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:56,890
I'm going to talk about the research

278
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:59,529
criteria comparison but first of all I

279
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:02,410
want to clarify something about what sub

280
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:06,189
architecture actually the word sub

281
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:08,860
artifacts are stirred and SQLite

282
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:15,040
databases and for sure it's encrypted

283
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:18,790
for the security purposes therefore okay

284
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,829
so another to parse the database and

285
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,899
find these artifacts we have to decrypt

286
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:26,529
it and order to decrypt it we have to

287
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:28,720
find the key and the problem is that the

288
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:31,510
encryption key is not accessible so we

289
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,080
can't we can't go through the files and

290
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:37,240
extract the key and decrypt it easily

291
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:41,589
but the idea is here or the question is

292
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:43,149
here how the previous virtual find the

293
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:46,779
key and decrypted and parse the data

294
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:49,240
they can do it by do either routing or

295
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:51,880
downgrading I will start with Ruth who

296
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,430
think we all know that routing mean we

297
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,740
have are we escalate the privilege we

298
00:13:54,430 --> 00:14:00,219
take a system Travelodge so what they

299
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:03,040
did as utilize the recovery partition

300
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:05,020
and Android devices and flashing custom

301
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,050
operating system to gain a routing

302
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:11,860
access such this process have many

303
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:15,579
downsides which are either it's sorry

304
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:19,420
it's a device dependence it's me

305
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:22,329
loves or change the data so we can't

306
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:26,649
preserve the integrity and finally for

307
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:28,779
the new devices for the new devices the

308
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:31,060
the bootloader the bootloader is

309
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:33,310
unlocked so locked which means we have

310
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:38,589
to unlock it in order to unlock it we

311
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:42,250
have to to unlock the REM if you know it

312
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:44,410
and if we unlock this om we have to wait

313
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:47,560
seven days or we have to wait unlimited

314
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:51,100
time which the acquisition process to be

315
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:54,010
failed so this this option it's not

316
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:57,010
supported anymore also the other type

317
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:58,510
which is downgrading denigrating means

318
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:02,290
that we have to change the version of

319
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:04,889
whatsapp mean we have to install the old

320
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:09,370
version which is to a point eleven point

321
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:13,690
431 but actually for the new are a new

322
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:16,510
hot tub first us to and sell the newest

323
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:22,350
version so also this options no more

324
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:24,819
supported we we take in mind these two

325
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:28,720
to this these two point with other

326
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:30,610
criteria to to pal first table as you

327
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:36,579
can see this is the comparison between

328
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:40,149
the four first tools as you can see here

329
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:43,569
also some of them lack the opportunity

330
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:47,709
to parse the media picture videos cards

331
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:52,089
and so on also they can't provide hash

332
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:53,829
feature also for project arrangement

333
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:56,980
they didn't support it which is very

334
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:58,630
important for investigator to arrange

335
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:04,510
all the files related to the one case

336
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:07,000
and one project ok but once we put what

337
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:12,730
subjugate it satisfy all this future

338
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:16,089
hamdulillah thank you

339
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:18,040
no it's the demo our demo we divide it

340
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:22,569
into two parts we start up with a video

341
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:25,599
we acquire the right sub artifacts we

342
00:16:22,569 --> 00:16:28,479
decrypt it and we show it the the life

343
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,750
demo we will show you how we open a

344
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,810
saved project and do the other features

345
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,579
to analysis features so we will start

346
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:38,018
the with you actually first of all we

347
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:41,349
have to create a project we have to

348
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:43,569
provide this for information case ID

349
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,910
case name investigator name and

350
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:49,599
description this will help you once you

351
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:51,910
generate the reports then we have to

352
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,649
acquire image want acquisition it's

353
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,709
dividing the two part we have to verify

354
00:16:53,649 --> 00:17:00,790
the device connectivity first which

355
00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:02,649
takes less than one minutes this

356
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:05,918
verification we use it in others to show

357
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:08,589
the information needed for the device

358
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,270
like I am I and other to satisfy one of

359
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:16,599
the test assertions

360
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:19,329
as you can see here okay yeah as you can

361
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:21,760
see here we show information about the

362
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:24,189
device software region device model

363
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:28,240
serial number I am i and service

364
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:31,390
provider so we hunt blessed spy one of

365
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,160
the test assertions also we now restart

366
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:38,430
the acquisition but before we have to

367
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,430
give anything for this image

368
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:03,370
okay so now the acquisition process will

369
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:07,210
start it will take one and a half

370
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:10,360
minutes it will acquire an encrypted

371
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:12,370
database which is a scale light and it

372
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,469
will be decrypted and so it will shown

373
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:17,080
here in the light side with a node with

374
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:20,950
an industry-led provided and the

375
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:25,870
artifacts will be built below this the

376
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:29,039
the node of the image so the curstyn

377
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,039
process is completed hamdallah

378
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:36,039
okay this is the hash value actually

379
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:38,470
this once we acquired database we have

380
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:46,870
to calculate the hash and this has to be

381
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:50,649
used for the future references okay now

382
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:53,949
this is the database and all the

383
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:58,379
artifacts will be listed below then we

384
00:18:53,950 --> 00:19:01,720
saved this project and order to open it

385
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:04,299
for further analysis because I will we

386
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,399
will now do our life our demo and which

387
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:14,730
we will open this project and we will

388
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:14,729
explain more more features okay

389
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,910
so this is the interface and others to

390
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,850
open the safety projects we have to go

391
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:35,560
file up in a project then we have to

392
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:40,600
specify the project that we already

393
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:43,240
saved which is obviously the air so this

394
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:46,240
is the image that we already acquired as

395
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,450
you can see here we divide we divide the

396
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:53,650
nodes charts locations vectors and all

397
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:56,910
the media type so once we expand this

398
00:19:53,650 --> 00:20:00,610
charts we will see many nodes each node

399
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:04,870
specify the specific conversation so if

400
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:09,429
we if you press this this node we will

401
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:12,610
show this conversation than by honor and

402
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:15,190
this phone number we mean by honor is

403
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:19,149
that the one that we acquire image from

404
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:21,250
it so as you can see here there's Arabic

405
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,170
letters so also our tool it's not

406
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:27,040
limited to the English Setter also phone

407
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:28,960
and latarian glasses okay also a

408
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,690
location but for this image there is no

409
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,090
location but if if you find the location

410
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:37,660
will last all this information latitude

411
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:39,730
and longitude also for back chairs this

412
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,560
is the this is the virtual who's sent

413
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:46,180
and who's received easily by

414
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:48,190
double-clicking it will use the default

415
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:52,360
supplier of your computer and still show

416
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:56,950
the image for it okay as for the voice

417
00:20:52,360 --> 00:21:01,360
you know it we will okay we will double

418
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:06,520
click on it it ended to Allah it will

419
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:08,770
also use the it will use the default

420
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:12,820
flying different also for the videos

421
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:17,139
ideas a document as for documents also

422
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:21,790
we can double click on it and this will

423
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:26,440
show this document what else yes for the

424
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:26,889
calls also you can see here all the

425
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,770
calls

426
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:31,870
who's starting dark holes the one who

427
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:36,190
called the other and if it's answered

428
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:38,350
miss declined and many others things ok

429
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,160
this is for the parsing the other thing

430
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,290
at

431
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:45,670
the pockmark what doesn't mean pockmark

432
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:47,710
we means that instead of let the

433
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:51,220
investigator each time to go through all

434
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:53,440
the artifacts he can easily select the

435
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:56,530
suspicious file or the evidences and

436
00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:01,240
listed here for easy reference so let's

437
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:04,030
consider for this one we think is

438
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:07,270
suspicious we double click on it then we

439
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:09,190
go to action add two bookmark list we

440
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,190
have to specify if it is certain

441
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:16,240
evidence or suspicious

442
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:18,760
let's consider it suspicious so you can

443
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,370
see it here this is the the one that we

444
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,020
added we can change the color if we now

445
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:25,959
certain that it's evidence and we can

446
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:29,620
delete it if it doesn't indicate

447
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:36,280
anything so in case we change it it will

448
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:37,750
change the color so the thing is that in

449
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,450
case the investigator done with the

450
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:43,660
investigation he can generate the report

451
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,880
and all the evidences are listed here

452
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:49,150
with the red color will be directly

453
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,150
added to the report so from action

454
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:54,070
generates reports we can generate it in

455
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:56,620
Arabic or English language I will show

456
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:59,679
you the English one so this is the

457
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:02,110
reports we can we have to fill this

458
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,420
information actually we specify this

459
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:06,969
information paste because we analyse

460
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,530
lots of the investigation process and we

461
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,680
adapted I think that we think it's

462
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:13,270
related to the our case so as you can

463
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,280
see here the case ID the case

464
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:16,660
description investigator name let's

465
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,550
really specify it once we create a

466
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:22,390
project as assumed AIESEC this would be

467
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:25,570
added also here he has the investigator

468
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:27,370
should write anything about the

469
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,560
investigation process also for the

470
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:31,510
conclusion and many other things as you

471
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:34,710
can see here this is the evidences that

472
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:37,680
we already chose as a certain evidence

473
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:40,150
so it's automatically ethically here

474
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,040
once the information is filed we will

475
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:44,290
save the added information to be saved

476
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:47,170
and it will actually export a report and

477
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:53,039
this reports will be used to submit it

478
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:57,549
to the court that's all for the demo

479
00:23:53,039 --> 00:24:00,820
okay I forget something important so for

480
00:23:57,549 --> 00:24:03,309
the search of course we can we can

481
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:06,759
search for a specific number or for a

482
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:11,499
specific word to easy fine

483
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:12,279
so as you can see I only are but I are

484
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:16,509
sorry I

485
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:21,669
so to list all the messages that contain

486
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:25,990
this letter as for the house as well we

487
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:28,149
can click this image for example and we

488
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:32,799
have to calculate hash and this is the

489
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:34,899
hashtag responded to this file and now

490
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:39,399
my colleague let me I will continue with

491
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:41,229
you Thank You Manik for introducing me

492
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:43,809
I'm going to continue with you with the

493
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:46,330
last part of our presentation so first

494
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:48,580
of all we mentioned many tools earlier

495
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:52,629
I'm going to talk to you about what

496
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:54,820
makes our total special first of all the

497
00:24:52,629 --> 00:24:57,730
key access method as as my colleagues

498
00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:00,158
mentioned the database that is a start

499
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:02,889
in the evidence and in the victim or the

500
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,899
suspect device is encrypted so we have

501
00:25:02,889 --> 00:25:07,389
to get the encrypt the decryption key

502
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:10,479
how we can get it by either rooting or

503
00:25:07,389 --> 00:25:14,019
downgrading but those methods have their

504
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:17,529
own add disadvantage so we we came up

505
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:22,059
with our own workaround to get fear to

506
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:25,570
get the key such that such that it

507
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:32,379
preserves the integrity and it keeps the

508
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:35,918
evidence intact and yeah and and this is

509
00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:37,539
currently and under patent so we cannot

510
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:42,039
expose more details about it

511
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:45,610
yeah the second thing is that our tool

512
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:48,009
proves to be efficient we measured its

513
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,869
efficiency against two factors which are

514
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:53,590
short response time at minimal use of

515
00:25:49,869 --> 00:25:55,928
resources for the short response time we

516
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:58,480
compared our tool against other tools

517
00:25:55,929 --> 00:26:00,639
and we calculated the average short

518
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,710
response time against two criterias

519
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:04,449
which are device connectivity and the

520
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,070
acquisition part for the device

521
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,770
connectivity we connect

522
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:11,889
the suspect device and we calculated the

523
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:14,050
average time for our tool to detect that

524
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:16,870
there is a connected device and the

525
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:19,419
average short response time is around 15

526
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:23,320
seconds for the acquisition time the

527
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:27,820
total time is around 40 seconds also our

528
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:31,030
tool have a minimal use of resources the

529
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:33,760
total space for our tool is 600 around

530
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:37,420
1,600 kilobytes which is considerably

531
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,670
low for the date data integrity we

532
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:42,820
ensured that the acquired whatsapp files

533
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:46,300
are the same as the one acquired at our

534
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:48,760
12 so we calculated the hash value that

535
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:51,940
resides in the victim or the suspect

536
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,860
device and we compared that hash value

537
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:59,230
with the one that we acquired using our

538
00:26:53,860 --> 00:27:01,780
tool and they were the same so our tools

539
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:05,230
preserve the data integrity for the

540
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:07,840
reliability the reliability is defined

541
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:12,070
as the the time between the interruption

542
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,290
and the resumption so we run our tool

543
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:17,710
and we tested it against two criterion

544
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:21,070
the device connectivity interruption so

545
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:22,840
when we unplug the device the time for

546
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:25,409
our tools recognize that there is an

547
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:28,060
interruption is around seven seconds and

548
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:31,630
during the acquisition if there is an

549
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:33,730
interruption the tool will detect that

550
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:37,630
there is an interruption and around five

551
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:40,000
seconds for the ease of use we show our

552
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:42,400
tool for the digital investigators and

553
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,250
the digital criminal evidence in Saudi

554
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:48,370
Arabia and they specify that it is easy

555
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:53,920
to use they find it easy to use and our

556
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:57,750
supervisors give us a good feedbacks

557
00:27:53,920 --> 00:28:01,270
around that for the main turbidity and

558
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:04,450
our tool is up to date with current

559
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:09,580
mobile forensics tool and one of the

560
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:12,700
examples is the bookmark now for the

561
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:16,290
security implementation we show you in

562
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:19,450
the demo earlier that we use CH a 512

563
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:25,750
algorithm why we should why we use this

564
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:27,549
specifically because because it has an

565
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,470
invisible collision attack what do I

566
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:31,870
mean by collision attack is that two

567
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:35,100
files have the same hashed value

568
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:43,500
so in share 502 twelve it is invisible

569
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:43,500
so it is not detected yet so wait okay

570
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:50,019
okay so this attack this attack does

571
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:52,210
exist in all hashing algorithm and and

572
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:54,090
it was a shock for me to know that all

573
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:59,409
hash algorithms have collision attack

574
00:28:54,090 --> 00:29:04,840
but the core here is to make this is to

575
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:08,440
make it hard to find so the generated

576
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:11,039
samples to have a collision we have to

577
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:15,340
generate around 2 to the power of 256

578
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:19,389
samples which is which will take around

579
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:24,360
1.2 2 years to find the collision so we

580
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:26,649
implemented sha-512 to ensure that the

581
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:30,129
favi files that exist in the

582
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:32,709
investigators workstation doesn't

583
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:37,059
collide with each other and those saving

584
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:40,330
the data integrity for the challenges of

585
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:43,178
course any project has many challenges

586
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:47,049
and one of the challenges that we face

587
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:48,970
is the SQLite database structure some

588
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:51,070
columns were vague and we didn't know

589
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:54,130
what they represent some just have

590
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:56,559
numbers and we have and when we read I'm

591
00:29:54,130 --> 00:30:01,510
doing bisque and many papers they didn't

592
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:04,899
indicate what they mean exactly so to

593
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:07,470
solve this this talent we have to

594
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:10,959
conduct a small experiments several time

595
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:13,870
until and and then we compared it with

596
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:18,100
the last database to see what this

597
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:20,799
number indicates exactly and I will

598
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:24,850
clarify this more with this example so

599
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:29,918
media waa type we didn't know to

600
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:32,439
represent what's and other numbers so we

601
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:36,460
sent photos or audios

602
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:39,670
then we saw this media waa type column

603
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:42,580
to see what is really represents what

604
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:45,250
does it really represent and the second

605
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:48,100
challenge that we face is two parts

606
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:50,770
database files some media files doesn't

607
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:56,350
have name like here it is represented in

608
00:30:50,770 --> 00:31:00,330
null so we refer to another table and we

609
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:03,070
look for the blob for the thumb image

610
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:05,620
and we look for the blob hex

611
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:08,260
representation and in the strength we

612
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,879
find the media name which will help the

613
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:16,060
investigator to know more about the

614
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:19,480
evidence this challenge was very hard

615
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:21,639
for us one of the lapses during our

616
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,080
experiments one of the laptops was fur

617
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,950
matted and not once

618
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:30,580
it was formatted twice so all the what's

619
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:33,220
up digger codes were erased and most

620
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:36,340
important files were were raised but

621
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:39,850
luckily we have iCloud backup on some

622
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:48,730
files and for the last what sub degree

623
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:51,629
had to record it again also as you saw

624
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:54,520
earlier we had to save our project and

625
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:58,390
the extension to save our project is

626
00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:00,900
using XML format we we faced the

627
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:03,880
challenge in closing the specified

628
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:09,100
extension since most of the tools use

629
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:12,210
propriety format like DD and EF but it

630
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:18,899
was hard to program our own extinction

631
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:22,120
but we we find that XML do do the job so

632
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:25,530
we sterilize the important objects like

633
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:28,780
bookmark and many objects like caste

634
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:30,430
project name case name and so on so we

635
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:33,070
sterilized those objects and we save

636
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:35,890
them in XML file and when when we

637
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:38,379
retrieve the project again we

638
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:43,060
unsterilized them so it is represented

639
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:45,450
and easy format so what next for what

640
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,450
sub digger

641
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:51,909
we will create our own propriety format

642
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:55,269
we will include iOS devices since our

643
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:59,610
scope just cover Android devices we will

644
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:59,610
retrieve deleted messages and look files

645
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:08,169
so to conclude we presented our tool

646
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:10,389
represented the similar tools and we

647
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:12,789
will present two unisys assertions and

648
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:17,199
our tool satisfies most of them all of

649
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:20,499
them and one less one important lesson

650
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:23,619
is that always back up your data to is

651
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:26,559
one and join is none and that's it thank

652
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:29,309
you for listening and we are glad to

653
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,309
receive a question

654
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:33,780
