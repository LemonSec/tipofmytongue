00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:11,079
hi good afternoon everyone it's last

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:12,910
topic in this conference I hope everyone

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,359
has enjoyed it

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:18,960
you have three ways ago my friends asked

5
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:22,720
me how to perform and Here I am

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,660
refreshing and tech so today we are here

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,288
okay let's agree style we have many

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:36,159
discs ours to share with you

9
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:42,370
sorry firstly first let me introduce our

10
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:43,780
team my name is Yoon ha wah

11
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:51,059
ha

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:55,120
she specializes in Thai society is very

13
00:00:51,059 --> 00:01:05,470
I am a speaker and a bra and a color

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:09,460
group polka jong-hong is our team member

15
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:14,440
he worked for Chiho my name is Yong JA

16
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:17,589
as known as easy I'm from China from

17
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:21,660
para to Darryl Talley second team I am

18
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:25,390
an independent security researcher I

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:28,619
worked for Alibaba but now maybe move

20
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:32,050
work for world

21
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:37,740
like the process of hacking especially

22
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:40,710
like I see ok t/o dia okay in this

23
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:44,110
pretension we will quickly review the

24
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,750
historian of and here am finishing

25
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:49,810
attack including as a meat who hasn't

26
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:52,390
been a flashy attack and HTTP to

27
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:56,170
assemble a fresh attack and the whole

28
00:01:52,390 --> 00:02:00,430
mac software fixes them after that we

29
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:04,479
will talk about how way bypass mac soft

30
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:07,540
patch and the purple and he om the

31
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,628
flashing attack sucessfully when it come

32
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:15,250
to the actually be to assemble a flashy

33
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:18,780
attack we will discuss hot potato

34
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:21,670
privileges correlation and the NGOs and

35
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,910
neural technology to perform and Here I

36
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:28,239
am refreshing attack and the felony way

37
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:32,470
we all talk about newell attack service

38
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:38,760
in SF according to it we have discovered

39
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:42,579
several critical security issues in java

40
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:46,390
come by this value military way we will

41
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:51,940
discard the far-reaching effects of NT

42
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:56,470
om the flashing attack quickly review

43
00:02:51,940 --> 00:03:03,010
the history of ntlm attack in about ten

44
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:05,709
minutes until a manager is a suit

45
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:09,190
helpful and here i am security protocols

46
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:12,940
used for remote education such as

47
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:16,020
launching into remote SMB servers also

48
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:20,170
NGO M is an challenging response and

49
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:23,590
cashing machines and here him and

50
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:26,920
catching is support by windows including

51
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:31,540
way one way to and slashing brushing the

52
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:34,660
difference between the three variations

53
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:37,750
and where we will discuss the difference

54
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:40,690
between real and virtual also entire M

55
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:48,880
and K she integrates by other protocols

56
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:51,730
such as HTTP s mb l dfp ok you just need

57
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:55,750
to know and Here I am protocol is used

58
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:58,480
for remote and caching so let's take a

59
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:02,410
look and to the NGO M and caching

60
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,230
process there are three steps which

61
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:09,690
including and here M type 1 type 2 type

62
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:13,510
3 message when the client request server

63
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:16,440
it we also know and um type 1 message to

64
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:21,250
the server including sport options and

65
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:24,430
dominant and other information when the

66
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:27,490
server received the type 1 message it

67
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,050
will generate and challenge

68
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:34,419
understand it to the

69
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:39,280
and the client received the type to

70
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:42,310
message it will use it to as a key to

71
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,549
encrypt long haul and here am hashey

72
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:49,000
the result of the inquest her she will

73
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:52,840
send to the server for an occasion after

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,349
the server received the result of the

75
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,068
Hashi

76
00:04:53,349 --> 00:05:00,990
encrypt it will use a semester those who

77
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:05,199
generated as a result and can pray

78
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:09,879
compress it with the disaster by the

79
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:14,889
client if the two that are the same the

80
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:18,240
education is successfully data that's

81
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:20,469
the entire process of and here everyone

82
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:26,710
education but as they are a sound

83
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:29,710
security issue we can we can find that

84
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:35,409
the crane can't determine whether the

85
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:42,520
serezha is a digit image server and the

86
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:45,370
way can perform precompute attack with a

87
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:49,060
client connect to the many show servers

88
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:52,659
the several Kassadin fix challenge to

89
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:56,710
the client and generate a limbo limbo

90
00:05:52,659 --> 00:06:00,159
table for the fixer challenging each

91
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:02,020
only it only takes a few seconds to

92
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:07,210
crack the Hashi

93
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:14,020
so Mac soft made some change in virtual

94
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:16,239
version for further patch in an tiem

95
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:19,448
which should have rules tab switch

96
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,719
messages the client will also generate

97
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:26,169
our window challenging usually together

98
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:31,659
with the server challenge to encrypt and

99
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:35,440
Hume Hoshi so so does attacker can't

100
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:39,610
predict the clearance challenge it can

101
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,860
prevent the pre-compute attacks cleanse

102
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:45,120
cleanse kanji is the big

103
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:49,030
the difference between way to everyone

104
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:54,699
so in some way to you more secure than

105
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:58,539
and hear him we won the SMB to SMB

106
00:06:54,699 --> 00:07:02,050
refreshing attack is very present hate

107
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:05,949
you attack in the history of enjoy em

108
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:09,159
refreshing attack really the SMB and

109
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:12,129
Here I am hash it to the sim server and

110
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:16,569
the local machine master indicated

111
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:20,979
server succesfully finally near to the

112
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:25,360
remote commander excursion the adult

113
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:28,960
Hebdo attack Asus 1300 and he om the

114
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:33,240
flashing attack with a user bros and

115
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:37,479
attackers web set with the fam scheme in

116
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:41,500
HTML browser well Wilson down and Here I

117
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:44,830
am has she to attacker at panco me the

118
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:50,099
attacker calculator and human hash you

119
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:56,620
to the victim and felony due to the IC

120
00:07:50,099 --> 00:08:01,029
so max total release - named Amy acid

121
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:03,729
they're all age they're all six eight

122
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:08,169
for this vulnerability which will

123
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:10,800
maintain and changee table the issue the

124
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:15,219
challenge we are putting it and can't

125
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:19,120
identity to local machine family it can

126
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:23,979
stop the stop delayed nothing um he/she

127
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,560
to the same machine however we can find

128
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:31,860
that changing table can tell show with

129
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:34,958
other servers so we can we can relate to

130
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:38,800
another servers and the game the most

131
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:41,919
remote common disclosure under the Mac

132
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:48,760
soft chatter fix fix to the refreshing

133
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:53,260
attack SMB to SMB a refreshing attack we

134
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:55,180
can perform cause pot protocols with

135
00:08:53,260 --> 00:09:00,760
rushing attack such as

136
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:05,500
GDP to SMB the flashy attack when we're

137
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:10,300
talking about HDB to SMB refresh we have

138
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:14,950
to mention hot potato ravaghi is

139
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:18,689
correlation hot potato combined three

140
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:22,300
well ability to perform local privilege

141
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:25,330
escalation one for HD beat who has a

142
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:30,250
bill a flashy attack the others for

143
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:33,700
table PID man-in-the-middle attack hot

144
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:37,200
potatoes and egg masala is perfect using

145
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:41,890
six steps to perform local privilege

146
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:46,029
escalation it it loses confuse so where

147
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:51,819
you saw flush house to explain the main

148
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:52,990
attacker process first we hijacked the

149
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:57,459
table

150
00:09:52,990 --> 00:10:01,600
PID request abandoned bounce poofy WP

151
00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:05,439
knees and automaticall passe discover

152
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:11,170
service if we had check wpad successful

153
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:16,209
or HTTP traffic will send to us know our

154
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:20,290
local GP traffic will call so our policy

155
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:24,400
server Jerry that defender windows

156
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:30,490
defender service our windows 7 which we

157
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:35,829
all request Microsoft Update URL and the

158
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:41,410
ways similar folder over HTTP response

159
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:43,779
to the windows defender client in 2019

160
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:49,120
hearing hash you with a system account

161
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:51,970
via HTTP protocol at Moscone and the

162
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:56,200
ways we later relate with the system

163
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:58,839
account to the local SMB servers felony

164
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,800
needed to travel energies correlation

165
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:05,970
for long privileged account to sister

166
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:10,049
accounts it's cool

167
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:15,509
so macro social realist to patch two

168
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:19,728
phases I'm a 16 that also find use for

169
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:25,709
the HDP to SMB the flashing attack and

170
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:27,659
the MS 1607 7 use for the tableau PID

171
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:32,128
but in the middle and tears

172
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:37,519
Tamra PID were you and we are not you

173
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:41,909
net past and talents and Elementium hash

174
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:44,669
so max Horta fixes our HDB to assemble a

175
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:49,819
flashing attack availability but they

176
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:49,819
are a sound security issue in this patch

177
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:58,409
that's the way let's take a journey to

178
00:11:54,059 --> 00:12:03,089
penthouse Microsoft edge and achieve the

179
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:07,079
goal of a remote command execution at

180
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:10,919
the first way peripheral the flashing

181
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:14,608
attack on Windows 7 with patch and

182
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:18,720
install and whether laden Anton Hume has

183
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:23,249
she to the local SME servers the summer

184
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,919
little stays successes called to us so

185
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:30,659
we can purple enjoy am refreshing

186
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:32,909
successfully and the way perform the

187
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:36,209
fashion on Windows 7

188
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:40,649
wednesdaypatchy installed as a Miss our

189
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:44,878
status access than to us we can say in

190
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:50,039
this screenshot what happened during the

191
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:53,699
application process we analyze it way

192
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:56,869
underneath it or the traffic generates

193
00:12:53,699 --> 00:13:00,929
during the attack but the fun nursing or

194
00:12:56,869 --> 00:13:04,349
packed our bags are normal when it's

195
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:09,899
done really many relevant documents and

196
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:12,720
count that in tip T in the pass and lazy

197
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:18,239
awful and helium protocol and the

198
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,810
discover an interesting scene we found

199
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:22,920
that

200
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:26,880
there are some flash message flash in

201
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:31,229
India em education the document states

202
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:34,980
that this plant will have some more

203
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:39,990
scenes in the interim education process

204
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:43,530
and some flash are security related we

205
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:47,790
are very interested in these blanks so

206
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:51,720
well write a letter to us to file this

207
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:59,610
message messenger flash and Kota amazing

208
00:13:51,720 --> 00:14:03,660
discover in the preview preview failed

209
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:07,980
attack the entire M Education user was

210
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:12,329
new in type 2 message temp - message do

211
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:17,280
you remember his sister count but fixed

212
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:19,040
by Microsoft patch we can use it to add

213
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:23,610
tweet and Katie

214
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:27,780
but no way they serve it normally at the

215
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:34,160
mini straighter you can see from the

216
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:34,160
screenshot it's a crush or discover

217
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:45,540
when compared to direct traffic and the

218
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:48,840
founder found that the negotiates dog

219
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,209
Hong Kong flag modified by in the

220
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,700
capital message

221
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:58,380
what's his negotiate local core flag

222
00:14:53,700 --> 00:15:01,770
used for the severed limb and the user

223
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:05,700
been setting this flag the client and

224
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:09,360
the server on the same machine does the

225
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:14,310
flag effect it affects the Mac software

226
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:19,260
patch so we take the tickler question

227
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:25,290
and the contactor and attack test let's

228
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:32,520
watch our video clip the first way we

229
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:36,079
are drawn to name the I'm package into

230
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:43,189
user folder later and Hiromi Hoshi to

231
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:46,320
target that SMB servers and then we

232
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:55,230
start a menace plot and the listening

233
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:59,450
port for hopeful funny ways and HTTP

234
00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:03,750
requests from Windows to the M package

235
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:06,750
when I'm hanging disabled to the HDTV

236
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:10,500
request it will send for the Erawan

237
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:12,510
actually responds to the windows under

238
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,820
the windows wheels and and Here I am

239
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:20,670
hashey to am package automatically and

240
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:24,540
the imperative is a wooden Here I am

241
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:26,930
hashing it will relate to Windows SMB

242
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,930
servers

243
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:45,638
if you for the here I am the the

244
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:56,670
flashing at eleusis hopefully we will

245
00:16:45,639 --> 00:17:01,329
came down Shiro and Windows the local

246
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:05,230
knock off like he and the M package is

247
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:09,459
we have modified the source code we have

248
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:17,110
modified the way we'll release it on

249
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:19,360
github in few few ways one way is

250
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:23,408
successfully performed and he'll

251
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:27,329
actually be to SMB refresh yet we have

252
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:27,329
to talk about hot potato

253
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:37,630
let's take a look at the batch of hot

254
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:41,470
potato first interface HTTP to SMB the

255
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:45,640
flashing attack and then and which he'll

256
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:48,640
which had helped him I passed by us the

257
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,210
second is Windows different update

258
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,380
cringe

259
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:58,840
we are Sunday to Sunday Hoshi that can

260
00:17:53,380 --> 00:18:06,760
use for educating the Mac soft release

261
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:09,899
to a patch follow for this village so

262
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:13,360
Mac soft hair has a fixed and Here I am

263
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:16,840
changing for system account credential

264
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:23,320
after repeated tests we found out the OL

265
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:28,270
editor new activator the GI own points

266
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:30,668
to Microsoft have helpful document when

267
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:33,760
the Windows Defender is abnormal

268
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:37,360
it will also achieve a request to

269
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:40,940
Microsoft document website if we had

270
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:44,870
checked this HTTP request and us

271
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:47,710
for the roman response response back it

272
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:52,010
will send them and he om has she to us

273
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:55,820
automatically which can use for identity

274
00:18:52,010 --> 00:19:01,370
and the way you can perform and here I

275
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:04,149
am refreshing attack so we modified the

276
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:10,120
hot potato source code changing the

277
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:14,060
value of dog whole core flag and the in

278
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:19,610
purple and wpad man in the middle attack

279
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:23,060
as you can see from this screenshot when

280
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:26,810
on the server with Microsoft page we

281
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:30,470
installed way successfully powerful HDB

282
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:38,929
to SMB the flashing attack and let him

283
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:43,730
fell say disk root directory so we can

284
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:48,650
be sure that the pair effects either in

285
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:51,320
company in a dish awake I think wake fan

286
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:56,870
more and take a bigot or like Windows

287
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:58,310
document request however the in the

288
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:04,570
batch of hot potato

289
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:10,070
there is another patch a mess 16:07 7 it

290
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:13,220
fixed the hijacking table PID pan that

291
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:18,290
passport therefore on the server with

292
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:21,140
hash install we can perform the PID many

293
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:27,250
a middle attack so table you can email

294
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:27,250
me don't attack in death but that's over

295
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:37,370
there are two named middle middle since

296
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:42,680
it can abuse the default ipv6

297
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:46,610
configuration in Windows Network I think

298
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:50,690
as a man short in s7 and redirect

299
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:54,469
traffic to us for more detail please see

300
00:20:50,690 --> 00:21:02,929
the article come home using ipv4 Network

301
00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:06,190
well I'm here basics so wpad millimetre

302
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:13,429
ethically worse now we have bypassed or

303
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:17,600
petrol halted we can balance cerebral

304
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:22,210
ability to perform average escalation

305
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:26,120
the first step we a bill my basic

306
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:29,840
Windows Network to hijack wpad

307
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:33,320
and the way you redirect Microsoft

308
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:37,668
federal document request to us the way

309
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:43,129
we'll get an interim education hashey

310
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:46,940
and relate to SMB in servers finally we

311
00:21:43,129 --> 00:21:53,860
can execute arbitrary comments with a

312
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:57,440
hyper average in user you see

313
00:21:53,860 --> 00:22:00,830
incidentally before perform and he I am

314
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:04,929
really a check when in the middle attack

315
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:10,549
is required such as for poisoning as

316
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:13,309
support for net pass or area with moon

317
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:17,389
will implement me in the middle attack

318
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:21,820
we have no choice without waiting until

319
00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:25,549
there is nothing um hashes neutrals in

320
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:28,820
addition way always relator and nothing

321
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:35,000
here I am Hoshi to SMB servers which is

322
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:37,340
very strict so we needed to change when

323
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,669
you do to change current attack methods

324
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:42,740
let's say you've brought some new ways

325
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:49,570
to purple and Here I am refreshing

326
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:55,100
attack that's the way we all discord and

327
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:58,549
new attack as Africa suffers that can

328
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:02,360
you know most awful as a defense and

329
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:06,710
directly near to remote command is cozy

330
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:07,969
well once broad we can ban this new anti

331
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:12,800
service

332
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:20,210
I am refreshing attack and pro propose a

333
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:27,230
new attack method let's take let's take

334
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:30,800
a look at typical SSL fatigue well we

335
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:34,730
found an SSL for village we should try

336
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:37,909
to bypass the as a self defense and scan

337
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:42,590
the internet environment and the

338
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:45,590
company's internet server's it stung

339
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:51,649
during these steps our tank comes you

340
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:55,850
and may not say certainly pencil nicely

341
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:59,930
we found the old attack servers we can

342
00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:03,679
attack kanojo Network Canada if they are

343
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:07,370
is an HDD client we can attack this a

344
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:09,590
typical and evil there and they have

345
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:11,560
been client we can attack this database

346
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:15,350
current

347
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:19,340
when this networking enters the across

348
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:22,189
our internet or public servers waste on

349
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:26,449
the peeled back may directly lead to

350
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:30,590
remote command is causing this attack

351
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:33,620
may sound very noble but you said we

352
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:40,030
have found many of your develop image

353
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:40,030
that can directly directly lead to a see

354
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:49,120
so this new attack suffers we have

355
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:54,050
achieved the flow in Surrey break so see

356
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:57,560
SSL attack first we don't need to scan

357
00:24:54,050 --> 00:25:00,710
the internet just need just means that

358
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,460
the client can connect to our public

359
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:05,690
servers

360
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:08,780
most company problems as an attack by

361
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:12,200
the strict internet access so a

362
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:16,120
company's internal ignore most awful as

363
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:21,280
a defense by attacking network can enter

364
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:24,459
second we don't need to scandal

365
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:27,860
don't need to scan Internet servers

366
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:31,130
where Janet Susan our payload to the

367
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:34,699
client and came remote command

368
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:38,540
disclosure maybe some one thing is

369
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:42,650
incredible in your water at Harrison we

370
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:45,860
found many I see you I see such a

371
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:49,940
database client if the client connects

372
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:53,870
to a suakin till you actually needed to

373
00:25:49,940 --> 00:26:01,520
I see it is beyond the scope of our

374
00:25:53,870 --> 00:26:06,129
discussion today but we after a few

375
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:10,730
weeks we will show that data to disk all

376
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:14,180
so in the past many as a sample image

377
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:17,870
has have been cancelled you know long

378
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:21,290
compared but according to it this new

379
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:24,500
attack surface we found them we found

380
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:26,480
that part of them can tyranny needed to

381
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:30,520
a say so

382
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:35,060
according this new attack service way

383
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:40,010
also found a critical vulnerability in

384
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:42,980
Java if you have familiar with Java the

385
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:46,820
you must know the URL connection class

386
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:49,670
is based class in Java

387
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:53,720
most of the channel function you need to

388
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:57,400
request HTTP campaign the new engine

389
00:26:53,720 --> 00:27:01,970
service will just mention we account

390
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:07,850
started and in deep s study of reliable

391
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:11,240
connection from the khawarij of Java

392
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:15,620
URL connection we have found that in

393
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:21,370
sport and helium and finally by calling

394
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:25,370
during a function to invoke windows api

395
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:29,469
in security contest which is the

396
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:33,520
function to get when does the credential

397
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:34,740
is grateful that's we once if the

398
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,550
ayakashi

399
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:42,179
you can perform and Here I am occasion

400
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:46,220
automatically the week and she would go

401
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:54,390
hace para later and Here I am her she to

402
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:57,590
local SMB servers we found that the

403
00:27:54,390 --> 00:28:01,800
death or the behavior of yoga she

404
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:06,000
doesn't judge the URL but always do it

405
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:09,629
was true it means that the actually the

406
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,290
questionable Java will soon nothing here

407
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:17,160
ahem she automatically we can relate to

408
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:23,399
SMB servers and the directly into the

409
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:29,820
mode command is coaching let's take a

410
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:33,929
look at in Tao attack process first when

411
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:36,540
you assess have been ability to lessen

412
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:40,890
our servers and actually be requested to

413
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:43,649
us and waste under the folder of an

414
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:46,830
activity response to the server the

415
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:50,070
server will send a and um hash and here

416
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:53,669
M has she to us automatically finally

417
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:57,240
whether a laser and Here I am her she to

418
00:28:53,670 --> 00:29:04,020
the SMB servers where she when she will

419
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:06,450
need to the mode command is coaching we

420
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:09,050
no longer needed to performing in the

421
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,050
middle attack

422
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:19,290
and the way can watch our video demo

423
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:41,840
with Chow application on Windows

424
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:59,330
in a way we all found as a cerebellum

425
00:29:56,909 --> 00:29:59,330
village

426
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:22,399
and the Windows Windows server we all

427
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:25,639
send actually requested to us now we

428
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,629
will in support of this satsang

429
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,110
availability

430
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:33,770
that's the Windows servers and now I

431
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:38,199
achieve his request to unpackage when

432
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:38,200
she were which he has modified by us

433
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:56,930
well I'm package we say with the HTTP

434
00:30:53,660 --> 00:31:04,510
request it will be later and Here I am

435
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:09,760
hasha to the SMB servers and the way

436
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:09,760
star the man's rot in the game Michelle

437
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,890
we can find that who though this window

438
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,490
server

439
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:27,490
has installed a Microsoft and patch

440
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:46,000
so this candle and here seems that way

441
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:49,909
notice in Germany but affects our

442
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:54,170
generation if we can we say we received

443
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:58,930
an attribute request from Java the way

444
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:58,930
can came the remote command is coaching

445
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:08,480
to complete this attack and as

446
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:15,800
availability required so there are many

447
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:19,760
restriction nest let's discuss a new in

448
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:24,379
and I'm flashing attack to solve this

449
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:28,790
problem let's take a shower

450
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:33,110
as an example Java base class URL

451
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:36,678
connection calendar and Here I am hashey

452
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:41,840
a demonic only that means almost java

453
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:46,010
application fat to expand the empath yet

454
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:48,949
in addition to a sensor of Vega you use

455
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:53,140
other valve image to send a achieve in

456
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:58,070
requester to us such an accessory or

457
00:32:53,140 --> 00:33:00,910
Java desire realization and since which

458
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:05,030
we are synergy because requested to us

459
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:09,110
effective well just mentioned Java

460
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:13,399
didn't deserve realization in the

461
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:16,750
history of Java security we have to talk

462
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:27,890
about some attack assessing about Java

463
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:30,970
desire validation in 2015 yeah some guy

464
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:34,370
introduced their availability to Java

465
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:37,250
the organisation is browsing the

466
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:41,120
availability and came the hacia fetch

467
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:45,530
which is the most creditable ability in

468
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:48,729
Java historic interface the most other

469
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,730
java application

470
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:58,299
and the goal of most desire

471
00:33:54,049 --> 00:34:02,690
Java carriage to call the comments

472
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:07,668
convention to achieve the effect of Si

473
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:12,340
and most of the mitigation method to

474
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:16,970
verify whether the high-risk object in

475
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:19,960
process the mainstream ways to set a

476
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:25,339
blacklist or update Java security

477
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:30,740
manager was to prohibit diesel diesel

478
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:35,419
and diesel is high-risk Java object

479
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:39,259
however almost no distinction and HTTP

480
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:43,418
requests and we just need a cat cage

481
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:48,879
that can send an HTTP request to us it's

482
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:48,879
so easy to find us a our Gage commander

483
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:57,310
commands the with and Here I am

484
00:34:54,409 --> 00:35:01,420
refreshing attack we can bypass or

485
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:06,859
current the black needs and achieve the

486
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:10,520
impasse and after a few days later we

487
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:14,569
will release to generate Java ecology

488
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:18,080
for in GOM the flashing attack so

489
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:20,840
finally let's make a summary per phone

490
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:25,279
and Here I am refreshing attack required

491
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:28,850
request an HTP request signal to us we

492
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:33,380
have too many ways to trade or achieve

493
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:34,339
is request to us for example when when

494
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:41,350
the attacker

495
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:43,270
for example SSL access E or send boss

496
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:47,029
Cloud Servers

497
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:50,259
anything will send an HTTP request to us

498
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:50,260
is attacked

499
00:35:51,789 --> 00:36:07,599
