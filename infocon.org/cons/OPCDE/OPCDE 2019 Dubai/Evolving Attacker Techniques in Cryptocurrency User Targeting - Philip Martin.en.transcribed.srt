1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,509
thank you all very much just jump right

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,890
into it really gonna be jumping from

3
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:11,099
extremely low in the stack with the last

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,170
talk with some really awesome caption

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,259
talk to very very much higher in the

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,910
stack talking about how how

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,580
cryptocurrency users are being targeted

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,130
attacker behaviors and really what in my

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,369
view sort of the future of of account

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:30,439
takeover first quick quick about me I

11
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:32,430
run security a coin base talk about what

12
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,489
maybe just a quick show of hands

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,630
actually so I'm super curious who it's

14
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:38,250
started a very top level cryptocurrency

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,590
who's here is familiar with it

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,739
has touched you just played with it one

17
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:47,489
to call a half half dozen ten hands

18
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:50,968
great and then so so I'll start real

19
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:53,129
quick Volker background coin basis

20
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,989
cryptocurrencies company so we deal in

21
00:00:53,129 --> 00:01:01,140
Bitcoin etherium like coin etc etc etc a

22
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:03,629
better better got it I'll eat the mic a

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,049
little bit more apologies so we deal in

24
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,570
cryptocurrencies we are probably one of

25
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,159
the biggest cryptocurrencies platforms

26
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:13,408
around we store depending what the price

27
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,790
is today today it's somewhere around 8

28
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,840
billion US dollars worth of

29
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:24,840
cryptocurrencies for our users globally

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:30,990
I think I'm Shui atopy II any size ed

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,470
didn't be for so modest - I look a lot

32
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:37,130
of beer

33
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,130
wanna Chicano Chicana

34
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:44,009
so so the other way I talk about what I

35
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,810
do at coin base is as is because

36
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,750
cryptocurrency is sort of internet

37
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,570
movable money I talk about it as we run

38
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,040
the world's largest capture-the-flag

39
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,898
right where the flag is six billion

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,930
dollars or six to eight billion dollars

41
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,700
of our users money this gives us a lot

42
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,170
of motivation to protect it right and

43
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,360
give the attackers a lot of motivation

44
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:08,610
to to take it from us right

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,959
so a quick quick agenda do you learn

46
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,790
about me we're gonna talk a little bit

47
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,870
because the the audience's although

48
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,900
unfamiliar we're gonna talk a little bit

49
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,450
about coinbase and lay some

50
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,579
sort of context down so you guys

51
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,738
understand we're gonna talk through sort

52
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:24,849
of what we see is common techniques for

53
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:26,500
users targeting cryptocurrency users and

54
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:28,599
then we're gonna roll into some some

55
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,049
places we see attackers actively

56
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:34,899
innovating in how they are attacking our

57
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:37,239
users or decision cycle how they're

58
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,400
trying to steal cryptocurrencies from

59
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:42,579
folks right the the first piece of

60
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,500
context and this slide the first piece

61
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,940
of context to understand is that

62
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,940
cryptocurrency is a heavily targeted

63
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,950
industry so we average cryptocurrency as

64
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,840
an industry from the from a company side

65
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:57,040
averages I think the numbers currently

66
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,930
nine major breaches a year where the

67
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,480
losses are normally counted between tens

68
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:05,470
and hundreds of millions of dollars in

69
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:08,888
each loss hugely actively targeted space

70
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:10,930
however the losses from cryptocurrencies

71
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:13,840
company targeting are actually dwarfed

72
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,909
by the losses from individual user

73
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,650
targeting right and think about it this

74
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:19,540
way if you're an attacker would you

75
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,549
rather come after me who has you know a

76
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,900
40-person security team that's focused

77
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:23,739
on doing nothing but protecting

78
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,769
cryptocurrency

79
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:28,209
or would you come wherever come after

80
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,849
individual user over there who does not

81
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:33,699
have a 40-person security team securing

82
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:34,810
their gmail account right the choice is

83
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:35,620
pretty much intuitive the obelisk you

84
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,480
got for the user

85
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,109
alright so user losses in this space

86
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,418
have been extremely high and we see

87
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:46,150
attackers again but house of that money

88
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:47,139
motivation because in this space you

89
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,400
know you it's not like stealing our

90
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:50,169
credit card receiving a social media

91
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,790
account where you have to go through and

92
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:54,159
then sell it and convert it to value in

93
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,870
some way you have direct access to value

94
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,060
we see attackers really really focused

95
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,099
on this area and innovating very very

96
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,500
heavily so so a bit of more context

97
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:04,000
about that so we have about 30 million

98
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,629
users across the world

99
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,250
we're active in I lose count I think it

100
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:13,149
I think the current number is 45

101
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,639
countries around the world so we have we

102
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,639
have that's interesting because we have

103
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,989
users from cultures all kinds of

104
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,549
cultures all conscious spaces all kinds

105
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:23,138
of age groups a real really really

106
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:24,260
diverse collection which makes user

107
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:29,540
protection and a really in

108
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:32,420
ting problem for us in particular so we

109
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,700
the other thing we do is is again we

110
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:38,090
take we take account takeovers and user

111
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:40,190
losses very very seriously because it is

112
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,560
directly correlated to a user staying on

113
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,430
platform or not right user experience as

114
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,830
a loss on coinbase

115
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,150
even if it was it was entirely on their

116
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,890
side their gmail account got hacked or

117
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,330
whatever chances are they leave coinbase

118
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,950
all right so we want to make sure that

119
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,990
we build a platform that prevents a

120
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:57,770
prevents the loss from happening in the

121
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:59,630
first place and second is as extremely

122
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,310
resilient and can stop things sort of

123
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,840
sort of in the middle and then we want

124
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,490
to get into get into the attackers

125
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,260
decision decision loops and motivate

126
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,210
them to go somewhere else because our

127
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,360
attackers are largely economically

128
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,560
motivated right so so I light up the

129
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,060
world of attackers and it into two

130
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,800
buckets the economically motivated

131
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,960
attackers and the economically non

132
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,520
motivated attackers right I cannot look

133
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,169
at non motivated I think of the

134
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,000
traditional government government

135
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,740
attackers the NSA doesn't care how much

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,280
money they spend in the attack they're

137
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,160
just they're after the information the

138
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,929
average transnational criminal group

139
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,090
whether its formal or not has a profit

140
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,440
and loss statement online attack right

141
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,900
they want to make money they don't want

142
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,600
to lose money attacking a platform that

143
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,460
means I can effectively defend my users

144
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,840
by making it economically infeasible for

145
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,310
my for the attacker to come after me

146
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,119
just go out so they're gonna go

147
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:53,930
somewhere else that's give someone

148
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:55,430
else's money right let's see so so again

149
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,290
because of that we we deep dive we

150
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,910
investigate basically every single

151
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,980
report of loss on the platform so you

152
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:04,250
have tons of great data on how our users

153
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:06,800
are actually getting attacked and that

154
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,450
means we also see the edge cases of how

155
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,070
attackers are doing new things and

156
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,349
innovating because we again my job is to

157
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,030
stay one step ahead of that right so

158
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,440
that we are making it harder and harder

159
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,940
attackers don't want to come at us

160
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,620
because they're good there their

161
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,820
technique is gonna get ruined right

162
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,060
they're gonna go for someone else that's

163
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,060
slower

164
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,900
what's so that's that's let's talk

165
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,609
there's I'm gonna talk I'll mention this

166
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,770
stuff briefly then as well I'm largely

167
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,139
gonna talk about stuff that's actually

168
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,310
effective so you're not gonna see me

169
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:38,770
talk about credential stuffing attacks

170
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,030
on this on this in this talk because

171
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,650
credential stuffing is largely

172
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:44,080
ineffective on our platform because we

173
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,789
enforce 2fa for every single user you

174
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,060
know you don't get an option to have to

175
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:50,050
if they on coinbase you just have it but

176
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,880
we will talk about a bunch of other

177
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,710
stuff their attackers are doing so so

178
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,380
everyone this this is this should not be

179
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,609
a shocking concept to to anyone phishing

180
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,740
is a thing it's been I think for a very

181
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,930
very long time a lot of people have

182
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,630
talked about phishing phishing defense

183
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:06,220
as in okay we'll add to a say and you're

184
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,900
fine or what-have-you

185
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,419
attacker for getting extremely smart

186
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:13,299
about this these days so most fish kits

187
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:15,400
that we see targeting coinbase actually

188
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,560
include a to fa thefts component as well

189
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,900
right so that's that's actually what our

190
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,270
login page look like so it's not ours

191
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,900
you can't possibly see the URL up there

192
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:27,820
that's fine that that's not our login

193
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,049
facial looks just like it if you if you

194
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,340
enter a username and password there and

195
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,950
click through it'll actually give you a

196
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,080
clone of our to of a prompt as well so

197
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:36,789
you know you code from your qtp on the

198
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,219
back end what we see what we see for

199
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:41,470
modern fishing apps like this is it is

200
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,419
in real time making API requests right

201
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,669
back to coinbase on the back end there's

202
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:46,719
zero delay between the attacker between

203
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:49,180
the user entering they're using in

204
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,490
password to FA and the attacker using

205
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,100
that information to get access to to a

206
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:57,190
to a back-end account right that is the

207
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,890
stands in stark contrast with historic

208
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:02,020
patterns in this space historically we

209
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,400
saw attackers getting a bunch of a

210
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,320
bundle of credentials it would normally

211
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,419
drop to an email address or a text file

212
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:12,880
somewhere they bundle it they'd use it

213
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:14,799
in six months right so so so great to

214
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,780
have two if a you pass through that's

215
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,979
not that's not that's that's fairly

216
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,750
upcoming and not a lot of sites are

217
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:22,900
seeing that yet but but they are what we

218
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:25,720
do though is we also require a device a

219
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:28,270
verification feel advice verification

220
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,500
step on login so this says okay we

221
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,669
fingerprinted your browser that's a new

222
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,750
browser we don't know what that is yet

223
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:34,449
this largely stops

224
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:37,070
fishing in its tracks and and for if

225
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:39,789
anyone's here is running a major or

226
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:42,530
once once one day to run a major

227
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:44,990
internet site I would HIGHLY encourage

228
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,060
browser verification we see more and

229
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,220
more sites rolling it out now LinkedIn's

230
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,109
doing this now half a dozen other major

231
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,930
sites are starting to do browser

232
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,160
verification for for for anti-phishing

233
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,780
it's one of the most effective

234
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,280
countermeasures I can recommend however

235
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,949
attackers are innovating here too

236
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,240
right so so we do browser verification

237
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,440
when we fingerprint ur browser and say

238
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,360
this is a new device on your account

239
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,310
we'll send you email let's say okay this

240
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,410
is new we don't know this before please

241
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,719
let us know if this is legit and then we

242
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,490
enforce the email that caused that

243
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,320
notification to be sent is or it's the

244
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,910
the IP address that caused that

245
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,620
notification to be sent is the same IP

246
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:21,350
address that has to click the link to

247
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,240
authorize the device right so there's no

248
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,280
there's no world where the Fisher can

249
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,690
cause it over there and convince the

250
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,670
user to click the link by themselves it

251
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,560
just it's not it doesn't work right so

252
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,900
what are what ackers do is this is also

253
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,060
an attack page so this is this would be

254
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,290
the third page that you would see if you

255
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,650
were going and getting fished for

256
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,569
coinbase

257
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,090
the first page user name/password second

258
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,560
page to a fake code third page it's

259
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:45,620
asking you to copy and paste the link

260
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,680
that appeared in that email now what we

261
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:51,710
see is that this is almost completely

262
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,800
ineffective because it pushes users so

263
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:56,480
far out of their comfort zone so far out

264
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,930
of their out of their patterns that most

265
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,200
users with that would absolutely provide

266
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:05,300
username password but absolutely provide

267
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,830
2fa code will not do this well not

268
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,979
actually actively copy-paste we actually

269
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:13,220
go to user research on this and we see

270
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,900
almost 100% you know whatever the actual

271
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,270
number is ninety something percent will

272
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,240
do user name password will do to FA and

273
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:21,770
something like five percent will do this

274
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,830
because it's so it's so foreign for

275
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,390
users but this is this is just the first

276
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,830
cut like I haven't seen this I haven't

277
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,780
seen attackers do this for LinkedIn or

278
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,640
any of the other sites that do device

279
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,290
verification yet but they will and

280
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,390
they're gonna get better at it right

281
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,250
this is why I say I think I think for

282
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,010
the most part we're seeing the future

283
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,210
the sort of the cutting edge of

284
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:44,080
attackers as they try to break into

285
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,080
online accounts

286
00:10:45,609 --> 00:10:50,199
but so the the let's see

287
00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:02,750
hoppin duh so so so when we look at at

288
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:04,790
compromise via via phishing and account

289
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,370
theft that way we've seen extremely

290
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:13,000
extremely low success rate for users

291
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:15,920
right well well under 1% on our platform

292
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,600
the way users are actually losing their

293
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,849
crypto today and this isn't just coin

294
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,970
basis this is a cross cryptocurrency and

295
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:24,860
I would argue across platforms in

296
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,450
general the way attackers are losing

297
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,760
control over their accounts today is

298
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:33,290
social engineering is more traditional

299
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:35,300
social engineering all right this this

300
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,439
we it comes in about a hundred different

301
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,050
forms

302
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,570
everything from stuff on on Twitter

303
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:43,939
there's some nice examples of Twitter

304
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:46,339
scams a couple of the Twitter scams

305
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,240
their impersonations we see it on not

306
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,650
just Twitter we see it on Instagram

307
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,180
we've seen on Facebook we sit on

308
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,709
everything else but the interesting

309
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:55,010
thing is diving into like what actually

310
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:59,180
happens below there under the hood a

311
00:11:55,010 --> 00:12:00,709
little bit right so in general what

312
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,209
these guys are doing is they're doing

313
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:03,770
one of two things when they socially

314
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:05,420
engineer users they're either doing

315
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,589
something called advanced fee fraud

316
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,979
which is the thing that's been around

317
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:11,209
for since money basically that says hey

318
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,230
I'm gonna do this awesome thing for you

319
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:14,060
if you're gonna give me some money up

320
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,920
front and then the fraudster takes the

321
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,839
money and runs right it's advance fee

322
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,640
fraud so they're doing that and that's

323
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,839
that's very common you know hey send me

324
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,470
some crypto currency here and I'll

325
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:23,330
double your money

326
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:27,589
turns out money isn't free so that's

327
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:29,990
almost never is a true thing the other

328
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:31,520
the other path that the other way that

329
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,550
they're compromising accounts via social

330
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:39,610
in social media social engineering which

331
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:42,800
is a very unwieldy phrase is by

332
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,930
impersonating either sort of support

333
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,900
centers right so we've seen this

334
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,910
historically with like Microsoft or

335
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:53,150
other os-level accounts cold calls

336
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:54,770
coming in saying oh hey I this is the

337
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,630
Microsoft security support center you

338
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,220
have a virus please pay me fifty nine

339
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,320
dollars to clear it right that's that's

340
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,959
been around for forever what we haven't

341
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,400
seen a ton of in the past is instead of

342
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,699
this pay me fifty nine bucks to clean a

343
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,910
computer thing is them leveraging

344
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:12,370
that to access online accounts right so

345
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:14,709
we see we see this more and create in an

346
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,030
increasing pace for coinbase accountant

347
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,760
we see it actually for other platforms

348
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:20,680
as well where it becomes it goes away

349
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,870
from I'm your Microsoft security support

350
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:27,819
rep and you have a you have a virus or

351
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:30,390
whatever - oh hey I'm I'm gonna tweet

352
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,410
out Microsoft's at Microsoft support or

353
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:35,890
pick a fake Twitter name that sounds

354
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:39,100
sort of like that and lure users to call

355
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:40,720
me directly by incur by putting out sort

356
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,660
of fake phone numbers right this is

357
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,360
actually one iteration of or one theme

358
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:49,870
that we'll see as we talk about sort of

359
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:53,140
what attackers are doing to do this

360
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:55,750
differently is they're moving in a

361
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:58,600
direction that is attempting to poison

362
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:01,540
the information that users are using to

363
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,800
make decisions right we'll see this

364
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,569
woman talk about google answer box

365
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,160
poisoning ins new Google Maps poisoning

366
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,260
it's actually a pretty cool stuff but

367
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,870
but the the broad theme of going away

368
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:13,120
from directly scamming the the about

369
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:16,060
calls and into a world where they're

370
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,860
attacking the knowledge bases that users

371
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:21,069
are using to make good decisions is a

372
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,230
very insidious sort of attack path on on

373
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:27,310
users ability to effectively exist

374
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:28,720
online and protect their accounts so the

375
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:31,599
way this looks like for for corn-based

376
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,310
and for social media is you call this

377
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,010
this whatever support center you're

378
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:37,479
gonna call they say hey do you have

379
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,950
problems yes I do great I can help you

380
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,950
with that problem please install

381
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,840
TeamViewer or go to my PC or PC anywhere

382
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,630
or pick a remote desktop desktop

383
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:49,450
application and say great I need you to

384
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:54,520
install that so in order to insert sort

385
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:57,640
of foot bud here it might be in order to

386
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,900
fix your bitcoins or whatever they'll

387
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,790
use that they'll say hey user go and

388
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,620
login for me they'll log in they'll send

389
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,939
their this the the screen frequently

390
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,430
goes black it'll send their coins off

391
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,530
site and they'll come back and say we're

392
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,180
done and hang up we know this because we

393
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,260
go and get scammed all the time I have a

394
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,140
whole team that does nothing but go

395
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:16,480
ahead and get scammed it's a great at it

396
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:18,430
it's really really it's wonderful

397
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,810
they've gotten scammed probably

398
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:23,500
I don't know half a dozen ways in the

399
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:25,420
last last week or so so so how do you

400
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,150
how do you fix that

401
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:32,110
the number one thing that we found is

402
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:34,750
effective is and and and this is this is

403
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:37,660
not by any means a hundred percent

404
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:40,540
defense but is more effective browser

405
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:43,240
profiling on the website so the the

406
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,740
number one thing that we do that's

407
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,140
that's the hardest thing for the

408
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,880
attackers to change here is the behavior

409
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,100
of the mouse on remote desktop systems

410
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,710
acts very differently than on a native

411
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,180
system right if you map the the mouse

412
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,680
path you see that there's a lot more

413
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,779
jumpiness that so there are lot more

414
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,089
there's a lot spate more space between

415
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:03,400
the points that it passes through on

416
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:05,770
remote desktop instances versus on a

417
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,660
normal desktop so we we profile user

418
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:09,819
that user activity we don't we don't do

419
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:11,380
full user or sort of user profiling in

420
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,360
terms of typing and mouse movement and

421
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:16,570
all that stuff because we've played with

422
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,880
it and it just it just isn't effective

423
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,680
enough yet but we can do that sort of

424
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,390
this sort of feature based remote

425
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,430
desktop sessions act this way in norma

426
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,410
and other ones don't evaluation and that

427
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:28,390
we've seen is extremely useful in

428
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,640
separating sort of the the sheep's from

429
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:34,150
the wolves in this context and then what

430
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,560
we do when we see that is we don't and

431
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:37,180
this is a general approach that we take

432
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,739
we don't like block the users account

433
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,930
because that would be terrible will just

434
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,940
pop up very very loud warnings on the

435
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,099
site right so you log in with the remote

436
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:47,140
desktop where we think it's unusual and

437
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,940
will be very upfront about like hey if

438
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,750
you're on the phone with somebody right

439
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:54,910
now it's a scam don't do it and that has

440
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:57,089
that has made a significant difference

441
00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:00,490
in user behavior as we've tested it

442
00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:04,170
versus the just locking accounts of

443
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:07,959
people where that's that's just a

444
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:12,069
another obstacle the scammer will

445
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:13,780
overcome right the accounts locked up

446
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:15,399
yep sorry we had a initial on the back

447
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,470
end just go and login for me again and

448
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,230
we'll get it resolved and those in there

449
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:22,569
money anyway but if we sort of take a

450
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,220
page from the scammers game and inject

451
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:27,730
information into that users decision

452
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,230
cycle and say this is a scam stop we see

453
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,970
users actually pay attention and change

454
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,650
their behavior which is which is pretty

455
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,330
interesting

456
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:36,600
we do a bunch of a be testing on this

457
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:38,580
stuff as well to sort of better better

458
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,949
target our mitigations to a place where

459
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:43,919
we're actually forcing user behavior

460
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:46,350
change there's a lot of fun so this is

461
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,520
one of my favorite my favorite topics as

462
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,050
we see it becoming more and more

463
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,740
mainstream so this is phone porting in

464
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:54,480
sim swapping this is this is a problem

465
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,340
only in a select number of countries so

466
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,780
it's a heat problem in the u.s. it can

467
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,189
be a problem in Australia a few other

468
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,970
countries that have phone number

469
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:04,740
portability laws right where you're

470
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,770
allowed to move move phone numbers

471
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,630
between carriers very very easily it can

472
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,210
be a pro sim swapping can be a problem

473
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,380
globally potentially depending on your

474
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,210
phone carriers and and how they do

475
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,580
security so the concept here is on a

476
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,559
phone porting attack you have a phone

477
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,120
number I want your phone number I call

478
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:22,830
your carrier and pretend to be you using

479
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,020
some very publicly available information

480
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:30,030
and say yep I actually want to port my

481
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:33,059
phone number from Verizon to somewhere

482
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:35,580
else 18t right great now I now I control

483
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:36,990
your phone number so if you're using SMS

484
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,909
you factor authentication that's gonna

485
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,740
be a problem for you even if you're not

486
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:44,190
using SMS G factor authentication what

487
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:46,170
we found is most platform most sites on

488
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,690
the internet if you go through their

489
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:53,309
account recovery flows they essentially

490
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:54,320
devolve to SMS for 2fa right which is is

491
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:56,790
terrifying

492
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,070
right so we see that the very big common

493
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,330
attack chain we see here is attacker

494
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,280
gains control of users phone number

495
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:04,678
attacker will go through the account

496
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,330
recovery path for whatever that users

497
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:08,670
email address is Google Yahoo or

498
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:10,590
whatever which essentially will back

499
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,480
them off all the way down to SMS to FA

500
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:15,178
they'll do that they'll get in they'll

501
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,090
gonna ransack that users personal files

502
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:20,280
and email address everything else or

503
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:22,379
information that leads them on to a coin

504
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,240
based or a Gemini or a fidelity or Wells

505
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,090
Fargo or wherever they actually want to

506
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,600
get to more often than not what we're

507
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:34,590
finding is that users are storing things

508
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,149
like two of a backups backup codes other

509
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,070
things like that in their in their draft

510
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,870
folders alright so when we've gone

511
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:42,060
through and you can work with users to

512
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,709
go investigate well let's look at this

513
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,428
attack chain we see attacker searches

514
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,559
tailored

515
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:48,990
that those exact things as soon as they

516
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,259
get into email accounts right what this

517
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:54,450
what this tells me is we're looking at a

518
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:55,619
world and saying well we have two FA

519
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,159
this is wonderful

520
00:19:55,619 --> 00:20:01,918
we don't buy large actually we have one

521
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:03,749
fa and it's an email account if you have

522
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,019
access to that and generally backs us to

523
00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:10,080
everything else in that user's life

524
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:11,340
period which makes which makes which is

525
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,019
what makes this the most the most

526
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,970
damaging attack so Sims one thing I'll

527
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:17,580
talk about real quick so for in fourteen

528
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:20,340
going between between companies eighteen

529
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,658
T to Verizon or whatever sim swapping it

530
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,070
stays in the same company which it

531
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:24,809
actually makes it much harder to detect

532
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,100
you just call Verizon say I'll have a

533
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:28,110
new I have a new handset I have a new

534
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,509
phone I need to just swap this this over

535
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,889
my phone number over to my new phone for

536
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:33,119
me please you go through some

537
00:20:31,889 --> 00:20:34,649
verification which is again almost

538
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,629
always publicly public or public

539
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:37,619
information or basically public

540
00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:40,769
information at this point

541
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:42,480
in the world and they go ahead and do it

542
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:45,299
for you and then suddenly you as the

543
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,759
user as the consumer lose access to your

544
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:49,769
device it literally what it looks like

545
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,119
from the user's perspective is you look

546
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:52,409
at your device one minute you're good

547
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,658
you look at the device next you have no

548
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:56,639
signal no bars and you don't know why

549
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:58,559
and you have to call the call the phone

550
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:59,729
company who's very very confused because

551
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,200
you just closed your account with them

552
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,100
or you just you just you just on the

553
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,200
phone with them to tell them to do

554
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,998
something else right so from a user's

555
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,070
perspective it's incredibly hard to even

556
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:09,419
know what went wrong there by the time

557
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:12,139
they figure it out the attacker is

558
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:14,580
already six steps ahead of them and

559
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:16,229
probably in their email account and and

560
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,980
all under their next leg of whatever

561
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:21,990
their exploitation chain is right so so

562
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,350
what do you do about this there's a

563
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:27,629
couple of things there the the telecom

564
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:33,360
ecosystem I guess if I put it if I put

565
00:21:27,629 --> 00:21:35,549
it mildly is opaque there are the best

566
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,350
ways we found of dealing with this or

567
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:39,869
finding companies that have data sharing

568
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:41,039
agreements to the telecoms to say tell

569
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:42,480
me the status of this number

570
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,429
it hasn't been ported recently as the

571
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,159
movers have been same swapped and doing

572
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:48,059
real-time checks on users phones when

573
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:48,480
they're performing actions are those

574
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:51,779
phones

575
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,070
if you get an SMS to if a prompt and we

576
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:54,659
will at the same time check the status

577
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,549
of your phone number to say has this

578
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:57,710
phone number been ported recently if the

579
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:59,658
answer is yes we won't

580
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,010
that you have a code we'll say hey thank

581
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:04,190
you before you ported your phone number

582
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:05,480
recently if and then we'll push you to

583
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,520
an account recovery flow if you want

584
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,169
access sooner or we'll just inject a

585
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,559
24-hour delay and say just come back in

586
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:12,919
today

587
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:15,950
and you'll be fine we find that that

588
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:17,659
that that delay injection injectors a

589
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,039
little bit of friction for the user but

590
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:20,029
it injects an enormous amount of

591
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,970
friction for the attacker

592
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:25,520
who wants to be in and out well before

593
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,440
that that delay expires that's the other

594
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,690
thing we do a lot of when we protect our

595
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,299
users at coinbase is a delay injection

596
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:33,980
will give the users a happy path to

597
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:36,440
short-circuit the delay normally it's

598
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,760
with an ID ID verification or it's some

599
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,070
other more in-depth authentication

600
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,600
mechanism and to say we're gonna we're

601
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:43,100
gonna delay this transaction 48 hours if

602
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,510
you want if you if it's legit you want a

603
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,309
faster great just go through this path

604
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:48,110
over here but for a user should be

605
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:50,059
relatively easy effort attacker is shown

606
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:52,340
to be extremely hard right and that's

607
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:55,309
that's been I think an extremely

608
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:57,379
effective way of again changing users

609
00:22:55,309 --> 00:23:02,649
behavior in a way that doesn't change it

610
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:05,149
away from using the platform the the I

611
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:08,330
think we you know we've seen this in in

612
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:11,479
fishing in general in security but we

613
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:14,320
are it is amazing the degree to which

614
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,730
users will go to get themselves scammed

615
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,250
right or to get themselves fish or to

616
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,510
get themselves compromised so we never

617
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,309
want to be in a place or where doesn't

618
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:24,230
want to be in a place where we are we're

619
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:26,870
more subtly adjusting their expectations

620
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:29,500
as opposed to directly opposing them

621
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:36,408
right it has much more effective

622
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:37,460
outcomes for users in general two more

623
00:23:36,409 --> 00:23:39,710
things we talked a little bit about

624
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,659
telephone scams already search engine

625
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,309
poisoning is get some get some more

626
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:46,539
towards some of the topics that we

627
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:48,408
talked about upfront quick time check

628
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:52,789
get some over-the-top as we talk about

629
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:54,529
upfront where users are where attackers

630
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:56,240
are starting to poison the repositories

631
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:58,220
of information that users use to make

632
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,390
decisions right so search earning

633
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,980
portaging poisoning was very very

634
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:03,049
popular about six months ago for us and

635
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,240
we're seeing a spread to other other

636
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:08,418
platforms well also Auto cryptocurrency

637
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,730
where attackers are using public Weeki

638
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:12,240
your support platforms

639
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:16,510
where they can put their contents on

640
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,610
trusted domains and using that to steal

641
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:21,399
the first page or so of search results

642
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:22,658
for for critical applications so if

643
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:23,739
you're trying to make a decision how do

644
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:25,659
i how do I get in contact with this

645
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,250
company how to do this thing right

646
00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:29,080
you're gonna be bullet

647
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,880
you're gonna Google Microsoft support or

648
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,889
quanta based support or whatever and if

649
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,409
that pull first page is is essentially

650
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:37,658
scam results our view is that even

651
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:39,340
though they look scammy users will still

652
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:41,200
click on it and users will still use

653
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:44,080
that information because they trust

654
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,490
Google so much right so that interest

655
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,408
interesting sort of transitive trust

656
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:50,950
application there where trust shouldn't

657
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:52,360
be transitive in this context and then

658
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:55,059
these are two more that are that are

659
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,620
very very similar to that answer box

660
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:58,629
position in Google Maps locations

661
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:01,719
pollution so answer box pollution is

662
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:03,340
interesting so so the answer boxes is

663
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,600
this thing if you if you've not seen

664
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,490
Google's answer box right I think if you

665
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,168
answer if you ask Google a question and

666
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:10,960
Google thinks it knows the exact answer

667
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:13,990
it will pop up that a box right there

668
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,940
and give you that exact answer below the

669
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:21,159
ads because there's a lot of money but

670
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:23,889
above everything else right it this the

671
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:27,039
the way they get this is by mining well

672
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:30,820
structured pages like this one this is

673
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:32,500
actually a an attacker control page but

674
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,870
they mine well structured pages where

675
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,789
they think it seems authoritative and

676
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:38,469
they can pull out a little bits of

677
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:41,769
information like this to present to the

678
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:43,799
user so we saw or we have seen more more

679
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:46,059
attackers building pages like this

680
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:48,639
totally non malicious and mostly copy

681
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:50,379
stoled for our website the only change

682
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:51,850
tends to be the phone number that they

683
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,130
present which I don't know if you can

684
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:57,039
see you certainly can't see but it's in

685
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:59,440
there it's it's a everything everything

686
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,639
else is legit on that page no fishing no

687
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,120
no scam

688
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:06,250
nothing just one wrong phone number all

689
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,350
right you get enough of those that

690
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:13,419
Google indexes and Google will change

691
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:16,090
this that is a particularly insidious

692
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:17,830
attack Google Maps locations which I

693
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:19,990
just realized probably only ten of you

694
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,580
can see

695
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:23,620
because all the way at the bottom google

696
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,470
maps locations is another interesting

697
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,780
thing here so when you search on google

698
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:31,060
again and Google thinks you're searching

699
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:34,450
for a physical place it will pop-up

700
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:36,370
location results below the ads and below

701
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:38,680
I think the first three three search

702
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:42,040
results include a box of location

703
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:45,610
results right if I search for I don't

704
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:48,100
know Emirates Towers right it's not you

705
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:49,330
will pop up a location box there that

706
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,520
says oh I think you mean immersed hours

707
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:55,629
and this is where it is what we've seen

708
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:58,330
is attackers creating fake places in

709
00:26:55,630 --> 00:27:00,610
Google Maps in order to pollute to that

710
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:02,649
that set of results again taking

711
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:04,419
advantage of users trust in Google to

712
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:06,730
pollute the information they're using to

713
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:09,430
make decisions right this is almost

714
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:11,380
everywhere we see attackers innovating

715
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:13,690
right now is that that ability to

716
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,610
pollute that information this is also

717
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:18,490
super hard to detect for platforms

718
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:19,990
because Google will only show this to

719
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:23,770
you if it thinks it's somewhere near

720
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:25,240
where you are right so so we had to

721
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,650
build a bunch of infrastructure to lie

722
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,810
to Google a bunch to pretend we're all

723
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:30,790
over the world and run searches for

724
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:32,230
terms we care about in order to detect

725
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,629
these and report them and get them taken

726
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:35,740
down but most platforms aren't doing

727
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:43,780
that and this is a particularly

728
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:47,440
dangerous thing for users a couple of

729
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:49,780
the things I don't think any of these

730
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,460
are that I'll touch on them very very

731
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,290
quickly and then I think I have about

732
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,050
all have about ten minute five or ten

733
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:58,720
minutes for questions none of this stuff

734
00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:01,060
is is that interesting the one shocking

735
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,530
thing I'll point out is that is that you

736
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:05,139
know you see this this SMS phishing

737
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:07,750
message over here which we've seen huge

738
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,070
campaigns of and and when I look at this

739
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,360
I think why in the world would I click

740
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:14,679
that link that doesn't make any sense to

741
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,760
me but users click it consistently even

742
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,220
users who don't have point-based

743
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,190
accounts will collect that link on a

744
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:24,190
pretty regular basis and what it boils

745
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:27,400
down to is some amount of going back to

746
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:29,200
that sort of users will do their best to

747
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,260
get scammed or fished or compromised

748
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,370
right they're seeing oh I know okay I

749
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,350
know what

750
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,059
I know a Bitcoin is I want my big I want

751
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,279
seven Bitcoin so great let me just let

752
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:41,158
me click that and see what I have to do

753
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:44,549
we see that extremely extremely commonly

754
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:50,760
the other thing we see is attackers

755
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:53,980
moving so there's always been a a

756
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:57,940
widespread sort of set of attackers who

757
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:59,799
are doing things like job scams and and

758
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,870
other things traditionally the email

759
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:03,220
LinkedIn stuff like that we see that

760
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:06,039
moving more and more to encrypted chat

761
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:10,149
apps so we see attackers leveraging

762
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:12,158
telegram signal whatsapp for these job

763
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:14,979
scams this is a specific job scam that

764
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:18,149
we that we found that was impersonating

765
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:21,490
one of our founders but we also see

766
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:24,459
telegram quand a support channels that

767
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:25,600
are also scams right the the the nice

768
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,519
thing about that from an attackers

769
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,019
perspective is telegram doesn't really

770
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:31,330
do takedowns they don't really turn

771
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:33,580
these channels off and it's relatively

772
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:35,168
decentralized so there's there's nothing

773
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:37,299
we can do to make it go away

774
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:41,049
except user education which is a pretty

775
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:42,940
pretty tough Hilda climate and I expect

776
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:45,070
that to proliferate as well I expect to

777
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,870
see more and more as the encrypted chat

778
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:49,360
apps get more and more popular we'll see

779
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,529
more and more active attacker activity

780
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:56,320
there because it's harder to gain

781
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:58,840
visibility as it as a defender and then

782
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,519
I'll actually one more that's that's a

783
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:04,750
very very recent attacker innovation

784
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:07,360
know I mentioned is is iCloud backups so

785
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,769
we've recently started to see as we get

786
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,418
better defending against traditional to

787
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:11,940
if a bypasses like fun porting than sim

788
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:15,100
swapping and that kind of stuff

789
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:17,769
attackers are certain now to leverage

790
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:20,830
iCloud backups to steal to efface EADS

791
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:23,380
so the attack path we see has changed to

792
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:26,678
be attackers owning email accounts

793
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:28,990
pivoting immediately to iCloud to

794
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:31,450
download the iPhone backup that they

795
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:34,870
have onto of device the attacker

796
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:36,600
controls in order to restore to if a

797
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:38,889
seeds that were included in the backup

798
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,110
right this is this is today right now

799
00:30:38,889 --> 00:30:44,168
that's the most common way we see two FA

800
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:46,149
bypassed on coin based and and more

801
00:30:44,169 --> 00:30:49,330
broadly in general

802
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:51,310
is based on iCloud account backups and

803
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:57,100
poor user Superseries practices around

804
00:30:51,310 --> 00:31:00,760
that with that I got about a couple

805
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:03,810
minutes here before we break for for for

806
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,810
lunch questions
