1
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:40,000
The good thing about the internet is that you don't think of borders or countries as a physical thing.

2
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,399
Everything is very transcendent.

3
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:49,299
What happened is last year I met Charles in Singapore

4
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,600
and I’m like “Where you from?” and he’s like "I’m from Kenya"

5
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,523
So I decided to come to Kenya to visit him and he introduced me to the InfoSec community in Nairobi

6
00:00:59,523 --> 00:01:06,200
and that’s how I met Sam, Bright, Gav, and the rest of the AfricaHackOn guys.

7
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:13,500
I fell in love with the community here,
like the energy and what everyone was doing.

8
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,200
I genuinely believe that what AfricaHackOn is doing is really good.

9
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,799
I can see a lot of potential down the road

10
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,299
and even early signs of a very strong community

11
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:28,234
and it is funny because yesterday Bright was saying:

12
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:32,899
"I'm so proud to say this is the 5th edition of AfricaHackOn."

13
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,772
While I have no doubt that AfricaHackOn is still gonna be present

14
00:01:37,772 --> 00:01:40,799
and even stronger in 5 to 10 years

15
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,500
Conferences have always been a big part in the IT and security communities.

16
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,400
For instance, when I used to be a teenager I used to attend a lot of

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,000
user groups either organized by companies

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,700
or various technologies (groups).

19
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,400
This is where I met a lot of my friends and some I’m still in touch with now.

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Then I specialized toward security. I participated to more local events

21
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,200
and ended up speaking to international conferences when I was 19

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,400
and I've met even more people there which is pretty cool

23
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,599
because first you end up meeting physically people that you already know online

24
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:18,911
and you get to meet new people physically once you are there.

25
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:23,099
It really opens your eyes to what people are doing.

26
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:33,900
When I was in my early 20s with some French friends around 2010

27
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,400
we started our own security conferences (Hackito Ergo Sum/NoSuchCon) in Paris

28
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,300
The goal was to have a very technical conference with international speakers.

29
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,199
It got really well received and it was pretty successful.

30
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,400
It was actually the first time that we had a security event in France,

31
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,800
that was purely focusing on bringing people from outside inside France

32
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:04,699
with English content. Most of the events in France were still very French (content) oriented.

33
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:07,400
There is always someone who is 18 who is really passionate

34
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,280
and who just wants to learn more

35
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,099
especially if you look at the level of people who are like 18, 19, 20.

36
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:18,090
We are going to make a presentation

37
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,074
Yeah, what are you gonna talk about?

38
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,500
Eggs and how it relates to anti-viruses

39
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,000
How to break eggs... Yes... With a spoon.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Do I sit (while presenting)? No. You stand!

41
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:36,099
Some of them are really really good, they have the same level

42
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:41,000
as a senior engineer from Microsoft, Google even though they are much younger

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,900
when you look at people's work, which is often what's happening online

44
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,300
there's no such thing as age discrimination

45
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:54,500
because your opinion is only going to be based on the quality of the work produced by those people.

46
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:59,900
One of those (French) friends had what we call a "hackerspace" (/tmp/lab)

47
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,000
so hackerspaces are to my opinion, what inspired a lot of incubators

48
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:07,900
and accelerators that we hear about now that companies

49
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,400
and governments are opening to stimulate the economy

50
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,899
and to motivate people to open companies except that it was not focused on business.

51
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,600
It was pretty focused on technology

52
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,399
and people get to learn a lot there

53
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:29,600
and you get to share your knowledge with some the people locally once you are in a hackerspace.

54
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,899
So I happened to just jump into cybersecurity

55
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:37,100
and I need to get access to this computer like

56
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,500
and I searched all over the Internet did research for like one day.

57
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:48,800
I find out how hard it is to get done, learned it, got a VM. That day, that same day, and that’s how I really got it

58
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,500
And why are you guys in this field?

59
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,449
We enjoy it

60
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:57,375
Yea it’s fun. It’s a challenge, it’s interesting.

61
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,000
It’s out of the ordinary.

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,500
You never see people who walk in to a conference dressed like that.

63
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,399
normally just in suits.

64
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:16,999
My name is Joseph, she’s Eve Kilel, our godmother, and he’s Mike

65
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:19,199
and we gonna blow you away.

66
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,874
That anti virus is like a shell of an egg. And you yourself are the yolk inside that egg

67
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:31,699
So us hackers we usually get spoons and break that shell of the egg and we do what ever we want with the yolk.

68
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:38,000
We can take screenshots, webcams, all of that.  So that shell is really supposed to stop malicious software such as

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,100
worms, trojans, adware, etc.

70
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,180
What do you normally do in school? In school? uhhh schoolwork! *laughs*

71
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,000
My folks are very supportive by the way

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
They always support me everytime I need help. They just say go ahead.

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,287
Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?

74
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:16,000
I don’t know. Still in school *laughs*

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,800
Colleges like Strathmore (University), they have iLab, they have some facilities.

76
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,100
which are great, but we need to see more of that

77
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,300
and more facilities to bring in more training from outside.

78
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,699
to give you more international exposure basically, because in Dubai we do that a lot.

79
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,199
So we're bringing people in from the U.S.,

80
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,600
from Europe, from Australia, from China, whatever it is to do

81
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,000
training sessions of the people in the region and learn more.

82
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,012
That's what we try to do with AfricaHackOn, that's why we brought it all the people from

83
00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:43,600
Microsoft excetera and everything else.

84
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,999
So you get more exposure.

85
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:49,500
We are very lucky because we have a lot of attendees coming from abroad

86
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,699
either if you are coming from like Uganda

87
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,699
or San Francisco, speakers are coming from all over like

88
00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:02,300
Seattle, New York. Our crew flew from Dubai just for this

89
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,390
And people who flew from Senegal, Ghana. It’s also pretty cool

90
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:11,500
Even though, originally AfricaHackOn is supposed to be an Eastern African conference,

91
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:18,300
but we can see that the momentum of the communities is growing bigger and bigger

92
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,400
And yesterday when Bright was saying when they started AfricaHackOn one of the visions was.

93
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Going to DEFCON or BlackHat is very expensive from East Africa.

94
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:34,000
And so the initial idea was to bring DEFCON to Africa

95
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Well, Alex and Dave are speakers frequently at BlackHat and different other  conferences.

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,100
So this is for you, Bright. This is a gift.

97
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,500
Kenya has been a dream trip. And so I really want to say thanks to Matt

98
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,899
and the other conference organizers

99
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:55,100
because this has really made my dream come true to be able to come to a country

100
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:00,199
I’ve always wanted to come to with good friends and talk about security and get to meet lots of folks.

101
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,300
So thank you to the conference organizers

102
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,399
and thanks everyone for coming up and hearing us today

103
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:08,100
When you miss your friends who are really good engineers the best way

104
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,699
to see them is to organize your own conference.

105
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,699
So you have a really good excuse to invite or lot of your international friends,

106
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:17,199
but also to make more new friends.

107
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,199
That's what we did in Paris. This is also

108
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,100
what we did in Dubai with OPCDE. Once you do your own conference

109
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:31,099
It's a really good excuse to invite some of the best security researchers in the world

110
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:33,775
We’re not there yet but you have to have a vision and a goal if you’re gonna get anywhere

111
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:38,198
and today in some of those early slides I outlined them and showed you how we’re working towards it

112
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:42,599
Imagine that most of the central banks in the world that are at risk like we have seen

113
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,200
few years ago with the Central Bank of Bangladesh

114
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,886
when the heist happened and it made most of the headlines.

115
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:54,500
That risk is particularly present in Africa, a lot of infrastructures are at risk

116
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,000
because they are not properly secured.

117
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,100
This is why building a skillset around cybersecurity is essential

118
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,000
and we see it in Europe and in the U.S.

119
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
when a critical infrastructure is being targeted either for city or country.

120
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,500
This is impacting the economy as a whole.

121
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:19,299
Octagon's own assertions check if you have any of these things. They actually check Octagon's own driver, Octagon's own process

122
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:24,100
So you'd have within a race window change all these things on Octagon

123
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,600
so it is not realizing you're changing them to disable Octagon to change something else.

124
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,799
I think you guys are very strong here. There's a lot of excitement from you guys,

125
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:36,299
you know, so I can see everybody wants to build and learn more.

126
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:39,699
So that's great. I think a lot of Grassroots

127
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,799
so creating communities like this like SheHacks

128
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:47,100
and AfricaHackOn and so on but just doing these initiatives,

129
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,000
you know build out your own. I mean, even if you want to create another small group,

130
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,799
which is focused on something specific or whatever do it,

131
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,899
you know, you can grow them

132
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,200
and turn them into something else

133
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,600
So over time we’ve had more people joining

134
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,299
and it’s a great platform just to learn

135
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:09,699
and to interact and to have you know people in the same agenda, people with the same challenges

136
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,500
and ambition.

137
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,659
Yeah, it's been great so far.

138
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:18,700
But for before the fact that this it's a male-dominated industry.

139
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,500
It was not easy for me to speak up.

140
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,000
But now that's what SheHacks has done

141
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,899
because the fact that you are surrounded with ladies in the same field.

142
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:30,200
You become more confident in yourself to speak up about something.

143
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:36,600
The challenge still is the fact that the maybe perception that people have

144
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:45,500
because you're female and because maybe organizations or different associations.

145
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:51,100
wants to meet a certain gender too then it's not

146
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,388
because of merit or because you know your stuff

147
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:58,700
it's because we had to please that's why you're here

148
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,799
or maybe when you're in a group

149
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:06,098
and because you’re female

150
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:10,399
For me I'd like first of all I have I mean,

151
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,600
I'm here by merit and maybe now female is something else

152
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,500
because we do the same stuff. We do the same project.

153
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,500
We deliver sometimes even better

154
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,700
so it is out of merit and not because I’m a female

155
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,299
and that is why I’m here

156
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:31,007
When you want to get into a field you do your research

157
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:36,399
and understand what kind of people are in this field, then you get to go in knowing

158
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,899
what am I getting myself into. Another bit of cybersecurity was a bit tricky

159
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:44,898
because you get in and everyone is a guy

160
00:11:44,898 --> 00:11:46,846
The reason we started SheHacks

161
00:11:46,846 --> 00:11:52,000
was to narrow down at least like for this conference and for AfricaHackOn

162
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,899
There were no ladies who are presenting

163
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:58,600
and I'm glad least for this the time at AfricaHackOn at least we got to present

164
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,799
and also Ruby who was also part of SheHacks who got to present today.

165
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:09,050
So it's a good progress and I believe they still have space for us, at least to

166
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:18,199
to embrace and also speak. We are women. We are cybersecurity experts who happened to be women

167
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:24,399
The purpose of the group was to bring more women to the industry

168
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,899
and to promote more ladies to join the group

169
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:35,100
and our main agenda is to get to the kind of people in the industry and move from that.

170
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:43,000
We now had to go into all the different school to study the basic ground.

171
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,600
We have 117 (women)

172
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,899
We started off as a group of 15 and

173
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:56,065
progress wise through the conferences we met more ladies to join the group

174
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:59,917
and currently we are at 117.

175
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:05,799
I think the beauty with SheHacks is the wide range of expertise that we have in the group.

176
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,699
So right from there are amateurs to experts

177
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,600
so you don't really feel out of place because you definitely fit somewhere in this scale

178
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,799
and of course when you need help, help is always there

179
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,606
and aside from that full of that I’ve seen some members in the group

180
00:13:18,606 --> 00:13:21,899
they have startups

181
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,100
So aside from just, you know,

182
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,200
being technical and all that you can actually learn on one or two things.

183
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,700
If you want to have a start up,

184
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:36,112
what’s the process, what are the challenges, especially if you are a lady

185
00:13:36,112 --> 00:13:38,600
so I think that's the beauty of the group.

186
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,366
Maybe also the fact that cybersecurity has not been completely embraced by everyone.

187
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:46,899
So when you should go somewhere they see that you're a woman.

188
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:48,100
They won't even listen to you

189
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,100
but if you are a man at least they give you a chance

190
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,799
especially if you have a startup company.

191
00:13:54,799 --> 00:14:00,199
Probably the men in your group would belittle you and be like this one can’t do this

192
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,000
So you can't relate from that point you feel like why would someone tell me I can't do

193
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,299
it and I can even do it better than they can.

194
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,700
Even in places where the government or big companies are not necessarily supporting local groups.

195
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:21,100
You always end up seeing a lot of grassroot initiatives with a model close to hackerspaces

196
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,200
and people improvise,

197
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,500
you know, even in the Bay Area is this thing called The Hacker Dojo.

198
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,899
It's falling apart, but people actually love it because the internet is good.

199
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:36,000
There's people around, it's open almost 24/7,

200
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,700
especially when you're not overly funded and don't have a fixed budget.

201
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,000
you can't really afford to have a three years roadmap

202
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,381
and say okay we're going to tackle this problem and this problem

203
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:49,563
that's how we’re going to structure it. Most of the time you just freestyle it.

204
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:53,699
By definition, everyone wants to help, everyone wants to do something good.

205
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,399
The question is: How do you do it?

206
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,636
and starting often is the most difficult part.

207
00:15:00,636 --> 00:15:06,100
If you see someone who needs help, who’s in front of you, you will help them

208
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,100
and if you know someone who is smart or another smart person and you think they're complimentary,

209
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,500
of course, you would put them in touch

210
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,799
and introduce them to each other. The vision is to do good anyway

211
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:22,299
It's not only limited by your vision. Opportunities come along the

212
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:26,500
way and may shape that vision all the time.

213
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:47,899
So this has been the best AfricaHackOn conference ever

214
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:49,450
and there’s a lot of changes that we’re seeing.

215
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,416
We’re seeing 13 year olds present, again,

216
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:56,050
we’re seeing all sorts of foreigners coming in to actually

217
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,699
spice it up, and we see OPCDE coming in

218
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,899
to make sure that its one of the best ever and the audience as usual have been really great.

219
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:07,299
I can't thank everybody enough. Well the content has been great.

220
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:12,390
We’re trying to ask the question is Kenya ready for Cyber Warfare

221
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:18,399
I guess the main point of having a conference and doing side events is mainly around community building

222
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,500
because it creates opportunities for the Youth and makes opportunities more

223
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,799
accessible and everyone gets to do a lot of really cool stuff.

224
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:28,799
As long as you keep learning it helps you to stay

225
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,100
flexible and to seize opportunities in front of you,

226
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,799
which is not necessarily obvious in some cases instead of always having

227
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,100
a plan or focusing on building a

228
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,299
plan because as we know plans are really famous

229
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:44,981
for not working as we plan them.

230
00:16:44,981 --> 00:16:47,500
Opportunities also may change

231
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,799
over time based on your skills the better you

232
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:54,699
become the better the opportunities at least you spend time doing something good

233
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,899
for yourself and for people around you.

234
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:01,200
Instead of spending that time, you know just on social media Instagram or Facebook.

235
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,000
You can actually build a skillset

236
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,598
for yourself, mentor people around you

237
00:17:05,598 --> 00:17:08,299
and that's going to be very useful

238
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:12,000
for yourself and maybe help you or someone else to provide for their family.

239
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,700
The question should always be

240
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:21,000
How you can use your time in a useful manner for yourself and for people around you.
