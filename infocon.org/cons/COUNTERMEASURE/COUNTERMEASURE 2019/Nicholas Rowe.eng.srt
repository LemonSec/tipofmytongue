2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,830
everyone well a few of you already know

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,040
me in the crowd but for those who don't

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,759
I'll give you little bit of background

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,600
on myself yes the best picture I could

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,670
find but living in Ottawa since 2010

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,500
originally from Montreal and yes I don't

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,109
like the Senators I'm sorry I originally

9
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:32,668
went to school at Concordia University

10
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,890
Bachelors of Comp Sci so originally

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,129
trained as a developer turned out and

12
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,899
didn't really like it right off the bat

13
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,899
so chose a different path I got my first

14
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,789
job working for checkpoint up here in

15
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,520
Ottawa over in Kannada worked there for

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,449
a couple years then I went over to the

17
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,460
Bell Canada Security Operations Center I

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,770
worked there for a few years I sort of

19
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,460
cut my teeth in security ops you know

20
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,719
standard operating procedures whatnot

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,049
touched a whole lot of different tools

22
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:05,670
it was really a crucible worked with

23
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,350
some very difficult clients there after

24
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,270
that I moved over to the Bank of Canada

25
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,280
discovered what it's like to have an

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,280
unlimited bankroll so that's really nice

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,850
when it comes to security tools but what

28
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,220
it did it was make some very some things

29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,369
very clear having an unlimited bankroll

30
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:27,810
does not mean that you're implementing

31
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,299
your solutions properly so anyways we'll

32
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,479
talk about that as we go and currently I

33
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,650
work for bright sky I've been there for

34
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,610
about eight months we're doing some very

35
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,009
cool things with regards to our security

36
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,829
stack we built a security tool stack in

37
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,500
our cloud from scratch so if you're

38
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,790
interested come talk to us to the booth

39
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,250
and we'll we'll give you more details on

40
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,520
that but yes that's me enough about me

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,920
I've been to Def Con been to blackhat

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,619
been to b-sides quite a few times I'd

43
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,090
like to think I'm relatively active in

44
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,619
the community like to give back as much

45
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,810
as I can so yeah so just running through

46
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,430
the agenda relatively quickly what are

47
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,200
we trying to solve it's always good to

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,840
understand

49
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,920
ask the question make sure we're not

50
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,129
solving a problem that doesn't exist you

51
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:19,690
know what does Software Defined

52
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,430
Networking offer us especially when it

53
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,849
comes to public and private cloud you

54
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:26,680
know a lot of people don't necessarily

55
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,930
know the advantages and the the the

56
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,209
capabilities that are natively present

57
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:32,860
in those environments and how to

58
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,049
leverage them to further enhance their

59
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:37,360
security posture we're gonna talk about

60
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,480
zoning and what zoning means in an SDN

61
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,790
world as well as in a world where I can

62
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,040
do micro segmentation what does it mean

63
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,220
how do I apply it it's very hard to do

64
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,470
away with these legacy constructs a lot

65
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,569
of people are very glued to them so we

66
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:56,470
can figure out ways of jerry-rigging

67
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,890
them into the future I guess

68
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,120
we'll talk about the framework that I

69
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,090
that I've come up with how I suggest to

70
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,190
implement it again it's just a framework

71
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,190
it's just guidance so feel free to add

72
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:14,910
modify RM dash star whatever you want

73
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,799
we'll talk about this the how to use

74
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:20,829
that framework in a security policy as

75
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:23,079
well as a few tips and tricks with

76
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,120
regards to what happens after it's in

77
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,790
place and how you log for that that kind

78
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,420
of system

79
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,290
so again micro seg is a big topic how we

80
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,750
use it this is what we're gonna dig into

81
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:41,049
right all right so absolutely ultimate

82
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:43,180
power right I have the ultimate power I

83
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,280
can stop every packet going to any

84
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,239
system I have the firewall at every VM

85
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,069
it's a great idea are we sure well you

86
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:57,880
know this capability exists in public as

87
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,090
well as private clouds so why are people

88
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,060
using it well a lot of it is they're

89
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,530
unsure that it's there they don't know

90
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,079
how to set it up so we'll walk through a

91
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:10,510
little bit of that but I'm not going to

92
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,709
touch on that too deeply I mean we're

93
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,989
gonna talk about how you create policy

94
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:17,500
structures but again great I can block

95
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,630
everything I can I can I have full

96
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,950
visibility right and that's the name of

97
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,840
the game in our field visibility right

98
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,380
well for those who don't know microsite

99
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,580
is basically

100
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,370
M to VM communication right it's it's

101
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,979
how do I restrict every VM and make it

102
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:34,750
like it's in its own little subnet it's

103
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,759
it's micro segments right instead of

104
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,379
having large segments where I have slash

105
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,449
twenty fours and I have you know 200

106
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:42,789
hosts on those systems I can go down to

107
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:45,340
one host sitting in its own isolated

108
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,819
bubble that by default cannot talk to

109
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:54,460
anything but itself the technologies

110
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,490
that use micro seg have matured over

111
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,650
time they're still maturing they're

112
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,530
they're getting there I would say that

113
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,909
it depends on the platform and the

114
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:05,319
product do you choose that's gonna

115
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:11,949
really impact how effective this is but

116
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:14,379
that's that's an assessment that you

117
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:15,580
have to make I've worked with a few

118
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,020
different ones and I can tell you that

119
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,020
there are they range it's like anything

120
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,219
right I'm gonna talk about how do we

121
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:26,650
build policies so it's very simple to

122
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,750
think about isolating your VMs in a

123
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,650
single bubble but how do I build

124
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,539
policies that are that I can

125
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:37,000
operationalize that makes sense when I

126
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,500
look at them and that that don't that

127
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,960
that enable business right not an easy

128
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,650
thing to do

129
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,479
well do you it requires a lot of

130
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,759
planning and forethought so we're gonna

131
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:54,389
dig into that a little bit now all right

132
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:57,370
shiny new capabilities right everybody

133
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,259
loves new toys new buttons me included I

134
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,490
was lucky enough to be able to work on a

135
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,259
huge implementation and that's where I

136
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:07,300
really cut my teeth and figured out you

137
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,560
know I took a lot of it a couple times

138
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,729
to come up with a framework that

139
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:13,300
functioned so what can we do with this

140
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,339
yet right with it within with the new

141
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:18,250
capabilities that Sdn offers us we can

142
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,270
do workload based not just layer three

143
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,180
in level layer for access control but we

144
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,529
can also do IPS proxy SSL decrypt based

145
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:31,150
on these same micro segmentation

146
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,449
policies depending on the product that

147
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:37,959
you choose you again very powerful

148
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,800
capabilities that you can do

149
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,650
very focused almost surgical precision

150
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,039
right flexible routing options I can

151
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,870
tell you that I've worked in Azure

152
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,270
before and in Azure I'm able to

153
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,120
literally just point to systems can be

154
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,979
on the same subnet but I can tell them

155
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:00,050
via an abstracted routing table to fire

156
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,479
everything at a single host as if it was

157
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,340
its default gateway even though it's not

158
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,440
the Sdn controllers are very very

159
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:14,259
powerful a great idea in in in its

160
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:18,770
creation all VM traffic can be logged so

161
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,680
I've know no more blind spots but do you

162
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,440
realize how much log traffic or how much

163
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,199
data that will generate traditionally

164
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,909
people have had a hard time logging all

165
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:31,190
their firewalls so what happens when you

166
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:35,750
put a firewall in front of every VM it's

167
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,960
it's significant right the next step is

168
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,669
tagging tagging is one of the most

169
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:45,380
crucial components of micro segmentation

170
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,069
it's it all boils down to attribution we

171
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:52,430
can attribute whatever type of metadata

172
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,460
that we want to a VM because then we can

173
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,060
use that in our policies so coming up

174
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,639
with a proper tagging structure is very

175
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:04,430
important and I'll touch on that in a

176
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,550
few minutes yeah tagging is a new

177
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,279
concept that's very much alive in the

178
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,800
public and private clouds depending on

179
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,569
the platform that you subscribe to

180
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:21,680
cloud-based firewalls can consume these

181
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,110
and this is what's nice is that not only

182
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,509
are you able to build policies based on

183
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,400
those native platforms like your AWA

184
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,890
your AWS your is your or your VM where

185
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,750
you can tag systems and then apply

186
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,339
policies with but you can also buy

187
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:38,839
third-party firewalls that are going to

188
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,990
be able to consume those tags and then

189
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,029
create reference tables with which they

190
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:48,560
can apply policies so when I when I

191
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,880
first learned this I was like wow this

192
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,670
is awesome well and not only depending

193
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,170
on the vendor

194
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,300
sometimes you can even take those tables

195
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,399
and migrate them over to systems that

196
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,740
aren't directly connected to your

197
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,110
virtual private cloud or to your cloud

198
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,829
infrastructure so it's it's a very

199
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:08,589
flexible and very powerful way of

200
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:12,639
attributing or of identifying and

201
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,360
applying attributes to your VMs all

202
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,389
right so let's talk a little zoning I

203
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:20,740
talked about the alluded to this a

204
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,510
little bit before the zoning is

205
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,100
something that you know I've worked in

206
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,449
in federal government adjacent

207
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:27,790
organizations and and federal governor

208
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,459
adjacent organizations love AI TSG 22

209
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:33,100
they they love it they don't want to get

210
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,220
rid of it but how does zoning work in a

211
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,370
cloud environment right I'm sure a lot

212
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,420
of you already familiar with ITT su-22

213
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,980
I'll talk about this a little bit

214
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,050
afterwards we'll go into some some very

215
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,250
specific detail again ithc 22 is the

216
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,810
zoning model right for those who don't

217
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:58,360
know but is it required in the cloud a

218
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,310
lot of people will tell you no it

219
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,440
doesn't matter right if I can micro say

220
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,149
Gary thing by itself it doesn't matter I

221
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:08,920
would disagree I think it does matter

222
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,760
and there's a few reasons for them what

223
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,230
the biggest one is probably going to be

224
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:18,850
political when you try and sell your

225
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:25,779
c-level executive end they're gonna tell

226
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:27,399
you that doesn't make sense we have to

227
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,680
zone it or else anybody can can hop on

228
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,050
to anything right and when you try to

229
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,519
explain micro segmentation to them they

230
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,160
won't necessarily understand so from

231
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,630
this perspective I think it makes sense

232
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,550
to translate some of the zoning

233
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,390
constructs and some of the objects into

234
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:48,490
these cloud-based zoning models and I

235
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,980
would also say that as a secondary

236
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,029
reason security policy development and

237
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,430
the implementation of policies requires

238
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,190
a structure and zoning does give us a

239
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,959
structure to work off of so what do we

240
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:05,970
do with it

241
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,949
kind of structure am I gonna use we'll

242
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:11,000
get to that I'm getting there

243
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,620
then we we talk about not just micro

244
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,870
segmenting specific applications because

245
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,850
it's very easy to say you know I've got

246
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,829
a 3-2 your web app I want to keep that

247
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:27,480
isolated to itself how do I that's easy

248
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,009
to micro segment but what about when I

249
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:31,100
to start talking about bigger services

250
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,819
common services

251
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:34,560
you know Universal services that

252
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,149
everybody in my infrastructure is gonna

253
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:38,850
use things like Active Directory or

254
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,740
things like DNS or ntp or even common

255
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,420
security services that need to be

256
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,600
delivered or consumed within my

257
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,389
infrastructure things like sim or syslog

258
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:53,490
I need to Ford syslog from a lot of

259
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,170
systems so how am I going to deliver

260
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,149
that as a micro in a micro segmented

261
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,759
environment right these are questions

262
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,699
that a lot of people don't necessarily

263
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:03,839
throw out themselves when they're when

264
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:04,680
they're building this kind of

265
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,420
environment and then they get stuck and

266
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,129
they're like wow I didn't plan for this

267
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:10,319
so I'm gonna show you how to plan for

268
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:12,809
this how do how do the my framework does

269
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:15,389
take this into account and will

270
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:17,699
definitely help operationalize your

271
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:19,829
policy deployment so it'll help you

272
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:23,339
build a structure understand it and you

273
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,649
know get get the most junior analysts to

274
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:28,939
read something and make sense of it all

275
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:32,639
right so let's hop into frameworks all

276
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,209
right again

277
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:37,709
let's reiterate some of the questions

278
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:40,589
that we want it how do I apply IDs g22

279
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:46,199
zoning to cloud environments what new

280
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,449
capabilities and what are my new

281
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:49,860
capabilities and do they change things

282
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,879
for me right does my paradigm shift

283
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,240
maybe how do services however how do I

284
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,579
qualify and quantify services and how do

285
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,209
I classify them you know I talked about

286
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:04,410
Universal or common or essential

287
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,720
services and then I've got my specific

288
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,500
applications well how do I go about

289
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,990
categorizing those you know what makes

290
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,550
an essential service or a universal

291
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,980
service the Universal Service

292
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,970
so we'll go into that and then the final

293
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,620
one is how do i operationalize my a

294
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,630
micro segmented policy in such a way

295
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,510
that you know I build it a gold stamp it

296
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,990
and give it to ops and ops and ops it

297
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,930
didn't doesn't devolve into a tire fire

298
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:38,989
right because that's my worst nightmare

299
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,910
all right so this one's a bit of an eye

300
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:46,590
chart but bear with me on the left hand

301
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,380
side you will find the standard eye TSG

302
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,440
22 zones on the right hand side you will

303
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,180
find what I am suggesting as the cloud I

304
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,880
TSG 22 zones so this is my

305
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,670
interpretation of this okay

306
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,180
it's has in my opinion this has all of

307
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,650
the same functionality and you know and

308
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,140
and keeps with the this spirit of AI TSG

309
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,320
22 but it simplifies things I've cut it

310
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,630
down by threes three zone types makes

311
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,770
simplifies things significantly right

312
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,930
but not really we'll get into that

313
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,840
there's an adverse consequence in my

314
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,960
approach to reducing the zones from from

315
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,160
from seven to four and I allude to it a

316
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,070
little bit at the bottom here you know

317
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,430
how do I talk about will ask questions

318
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,550
to the to the class here a restricted

319
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,950
extra in its own or a third party zone

320
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,260
how do I deal with those when I don't

321
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,390
have them here on the right hand side

322
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,650
nobody

323
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:14,720
yep absolutely so whoa yeah yeah so this

324
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,890
is that's exactly what we're getting

325
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,410
into we've we're effectively getting to

326
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,970
the point where we need to define a new

327
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,240
zone construct okay so we call it the

328
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,200
zone instance group yes it's not very

329
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,230
creative but effectively what it is is

330
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,320
an instantiation of the three internal

331
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,270
zones that you would see deployed in

332
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:39,040
your environment but cookie-cutter so

333
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,770
the idea is that I can instantiate a set

334
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,290
of zones on a per application on a per

335
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,810
service on a per and and you got to

336
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,880
think a service here right because I

337
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,440
don't want to segment everything in such

338
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,480
a way that every server is isolated from

339
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,240
every other server but I want to do it

340
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,920
in such a way that I'm enabling that I'm

341
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,970
that I'm grouping VMs and servers in

342
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,620
such a way that they're delivering a

343
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,530
service you're not you abstract away

344
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,050
from this host is one of my DNS servers

345
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,020
and this host is my computes or whatever

346
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,480
it may be get get into identifying

347
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,270
services and then putting those into a

348
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:21,880
sig if you can zone instance group

349
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,130
that's the whole idea and if you look at

350
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,770
the mappings public access zone

351
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,150
operation zone and secure restricted

352
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,860
zone ideally you would map the

353
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,630
respective security controls to those

354
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,650
respective zone structures so what does

355
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:45,830
that look like in practice right all

356
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,250
right

357
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,730
so in practice this is what we're

358
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,570
effectively building right on the left

359
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,450
hand side what I've got here is the

360
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,940
three stages of a software development

361
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,340
life cycle for our fictional application

362
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,189
app 0 1 right

363
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,589
production staging and development well

364
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:07,730
what do I do

365
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,740
like when I deploy systems I might have

366
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,109
full-stack and development my web server

367
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:15,689
my app server in my database I have the

368
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:17,880
same stack in staging and maybe I have a

369
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,559
few more that that make my stack a

370
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,010
little bit more robust in production

371
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,689
what I'm doing is I'm effectively

372
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:26,849
isolating them in their own bubbles and

373
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:29,510
then within those bubbles I've got

374
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,700
different zones that I'm restricting

375
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,610
access to so if you look on the left

376
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,950
hand side I would my web server in my

377
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,590
public access zone and then I would have

378
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,420
my app server in the AWS and then I

379
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,390
would have my database in the srz now my

380
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,160
web server would never natively be able

381
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,890
to talk to you my web my database server

382
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,800
because they're in zones that according

383
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,690
to I TS g22 should never be able to talk

384
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,320
to each other

385
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,660
but this also solves the same problem

386
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,630
that I brought up earlier where if I how

387
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,679
do I deal with not having a third party

388
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,600
zone or a restricted extranet zone

389
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,050
that's easy I just take one of these own

390
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,360
instance groups and tag it as my

391
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,429
restricted extranet zone over my third

392
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:14,070
party zone or my third party zone

393
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,500
instance group and now I have a grouping

394
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,090
of zones that are used to deliver

395
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,820
restricted extranet services the same

396
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,460
thing for third party services and I can

397
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,920
even go further and say you know a third

398
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,770
party service with vendor X has its own

399
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,520
zone instance group right with you know

400
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,470
whichever vendors or business partners

401
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,410
you deal with so now the resources that

402
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,290
those people are those third parties

403
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,880
have access to is restricted to what's

404
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,570
in that construct any questions

405
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,900
now we're getting into the fun stuff so

406
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,180
how do we do this right we've come up

407
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:02,010
with a lot of the theoretical the you

408
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,900
know high-level plans

409
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,910
guy talk about constructs I talk about

410
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,930
tags I talk about you know zones how do

411
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,030
I put it all together right did this

412
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,120
this is the the core of it what we're

413
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,290
effectively doing is we're coming up

414
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,350
with a structure of tags a step one our

415
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:25,380
structure of tags is going to attribute

416
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:25,980
our VMs

417
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,900
and in this scenario I'm attributing

418
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,780
them based on on localization right I'm

419
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,300
trying to locate them physically and

420
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,900
logically within my environments so as

421
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,940
you can see in my in this scenario I

422
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,610
chose to go with four tags right on a

423
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,870
per VM basis tag one is my data center

424
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:49,980
tag - is my environment tags three is my

425
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,620
application or my service that I'm

426
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,140
delivering within that environment when

427
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,260
within that zone instance group tag 4 is

428
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,020
my security zone now again these tags

429
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,780
are applied directly to the VM right so

430
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,210
this is going to attribute my VMs

431
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,260
location directly to that VM so as you

432
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,240
can see I've got a few options that I

433
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,890
outlined above in my in my example

434
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,360
datacenter one two and three let's say

435
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,800
I'm a three data center environment I've

436
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,900
got different environments production

437
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,960
staging QA dev I've got different apps

438
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,810
Apple one apple two fo three core

439
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,450
services LDAP you know core services I

440
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,560
could have defined as DNS and TP you

441
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,030
know whatever else I want to define it

442
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,710
within that it's it's very much a

443
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,080
framework and not a rigid set of rules

444
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,650
right so and then tag 4 is just my zones

445
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,940
and the zones are the ones that don't

446
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,990
change those zones are if you follow my

447
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,940
framework this owns won't really change

448
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,220
I mean you nothing stops you from adding

449
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,050
another zone if you want but it does

450
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,070
complexified things a little bit

451
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,410
so as you can see you know in my tagging

452
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,420
structure I've effectively only really

453
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,360
got maybe a dozen different tags in this

454
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,220
environment but that could grow

455
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,840
significantly if the number of

456
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,810
applications and services grow as well

457
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:18,950
right questions concerns is it recently

458
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:23,530
hung over okay

459
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:40,400
all right yes I absolutely could do that

460
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,890
so as if you decide to do it that way

461
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:47,180
instead of doing code pushes you could

462
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,860
do it that way where you take a machine

463
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,220
from dev to QA to prod or to staging to

464
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,410
prod literally just by changing a tag

465
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,930
right that's all you would have to do

466
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,610
and then from a network access

467
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,860
perspective assuming you have all your

468
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,020
rules already predefined you'd be set

469
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,960
that depends right your environments

470
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,340
might have different rule requirements

471
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,260
right you might want dev to be a little

472
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,450
bit less restrictive and give it more

473
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,560
access to the internet for your

474
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,570
developers to work freely but then again

475
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,460
from a security perspective you wouldn't

476
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,740
necessarily want that VM that has full

477
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,110
access to be moved to prod right so I

478
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,880
wouldn't say that's a best practice I'd

479
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,760
say you're better off to do code pushes

480
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,680
and have your VMs stay static within

481
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,520
those systems within those those zone

482
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,550
instance groups sorry

483
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,100
absolutely however you choose to do it

484
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,149
you could move the machines around

485
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:51,350
literally just by changing the tag yep

486
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,240
has access assuming all your network

487
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,010
flow is already predefined based on

488
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,299
those tags we're gonna talk about how I

489
00:22:56,299 --> 00:22:59,419
apply those how I'm using those tags now

490
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,899
right so in the previous slide I said

491
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:06,519
okay my VMs have four tags each right

492
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:09,769
this is how we're going to use those

493
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:11,720
tags what effectively we're doing is

494
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,240
we're defining dynamic security groups

495
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,730
dynamic security groups are just groups

496
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,490
that are going to enforce a specific

497
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,620
policy based on whose members of those

498
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,840
but the the membership is dynamic

499
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,029
because it's based on who has certain

500
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,960
tags right so if I look at the if you

501
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,059
look at the the first set here data

502
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:35,179
center instance the the VMs that will be

503
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:37,190
members of that group are going to be

504
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,070
any VM that has tagged one data center

505
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:43,730
zero one so very simple right but I'm

506
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,990
gonna have a lot of VMs in that group

507
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,269
because assume in my environment you

508
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:49,340
know say I've got a couple hundred VMs

509
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,139
in my data center or maybe a couple

510
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:54,490
thousand that can be that could be a big

511
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,289
big group but it doesn't matter you'll

512
00:23:57,289 --> 00:23:59,870
see later on those are very practical in

513
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,730
the way that we deliver common and

514
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,450
essential services so again we we we dig

515
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,940
down a little bit and we next we apply

516
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,370
the environment to the group so now this

517
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,769
is a group that's going to include VMs

518
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:15,529
that are part of data center which over

519
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:16,669
data center you want

520
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:18,740
they said data center one in this

521
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,490
example and the production environment

522
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,590
and then if we go down further data

523
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,590
center one production Apple one so now

524
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,230
I'm within my app zone instance group so

525
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,740
using this group I refer to any VM

526
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,179
that's within my zone instance group

527
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:38,990
right and then furthermore lastly you

528
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,639
can see we're just applying a zone to it

529
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:42,769
so now I'm referring to within that zone

530
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:44,929
the zone Apple one zone instance group

531
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:48,230
and it's specifically its security

532
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,480
restricted zone

533
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,520
does that make sense yep so the way that

534
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,310
I see your starting zones seems to be

535
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,940
true

536
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:24,609
you could do that if you if you were

537
00:25:24,609 --> 00:25:27,039
chose to not have a data center tied

538
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,019
there you could remove the data center

539
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:31,179
tag from that framework and then you

540
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:40,239
could have just prod right yeah it

541
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,309
doesn't matter it's it's again some

542
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:44,799
people like to structure in such a way

543
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,629
where they have the their apps that are

544
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,159
running in a specific data center versus

545
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,960
another data center you could completely

546
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,389
chop off the data center tag from this

547
00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:54,909
framework and then just have prod Apple

548
00:25:54,909 --> 00:25:57,239
one and then I have rules that apply to

549
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:59,529
my Apple one whether it lives in data

550
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:00,909
center one data center two or data

551
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:04,359
center three right so it's it's again

552
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,369
it's a framework it's it's showing you

553
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:11,259
how to build groups as well as tagging

554
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:13,779
attributes that deliver what you want

555
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:20,049
right so in this example this is what a

556
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:22,269
policy structure would look like using

557
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:26,200
those groups so you can see at the top

558
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,350
I've got a defined set of global service

559
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:32,350
rules these are gonna be what we talked

560
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:35,529
about you know if you look at the source

561
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:37,960
again pretty straightforward data center

562
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,580
one underscore production in the first

563
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,489
rule destination is data center one

564
00:26:42,489 --> 00:26:44,519
underscore production underscore LDAP

565
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,440
operation zone so let's say I assumed to

566
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,629
throw my my Active Directory servers

567
00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:51,909
inside of my operation zone of my LDAP

568
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:55,600
zone instance group well now I've got my

569
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,100
entirety of data center one production

570
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,690
has access to Active Directory as easy

571
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:06,580
as that and I can apply an IPS profile

572
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:10,269
to it if I wanted to again this depends

573
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:12,190
on your third-party integrations and the

574
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,440
products that you choose to use but it's

575
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,869
just showcasing some of the key some of

576
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,669
the capabilities

577
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:20,230
if we dig down a little bit you can see

578
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,450
we've got an example of you know data

579
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:26,440
center ones universal access to DNS data

580
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,399
center ones universal access to NTP and

581
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:32,440
again in a dynamic nature so that if a

582
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,159
VM gets spun up in my environment and

583
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:38,679
it's not tagged it has access to nothing

584
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:39,669
right

585
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:42,580
only once it's properly tagged will it

586
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,529
have access to the right resources and

587
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:49,419
the right services you know a really

588
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:52,799
good example I like to outlay is is the

589
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,500
data center one production V scan so

590
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,539
from my perspective I work in security

591
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:01,149
primarily so vulnerability scanning is a

592
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:04,210
big part of what I do so how do I set it

593
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,770
up so that my vulnerability scanners

594
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,390
have full access to my environment

595
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,309
well that's often been a problem you

596
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:11,679
know I've got 30 or 40 or 100 firewalls

597
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,630
deployed in my environment how do I have

598
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,820
to go in and manually add a rule to

599
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,710
allow my scanners to go talk to all of

600
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,899
these different networks this is easy if

601
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:22,149
I've got a centralized data center one

602
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:25,419
production V scan AHS assuming the V

603
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:28,990
scan is my vulnerability scanning zone

604
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,850
instance group and Oz's work with my

605
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:33,640
scanners well I've got complete access

606
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,070
to the data center now easy as that so

607
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,720
you can see the benefits are starting to

608
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,820
compound right there's a lot of benefits

609
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,919
of tagging when you abstract away from

610
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:51,159
using IP addresses in your rules below

611
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:52,870
that you can see we're talking about

612
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,840
apps 0 1 and apps 0 2 and this is an

613
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,789
example these are example rule sets or

614
00:28:57,789 --> 00:29:01,149
policies that would show a again very

615
00:29:01,149 --> 00:29:04,390
standard three-tier web app with the

616
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,669
internet having access to the public

617
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:09,010
access zone the public access zone

618
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,289
having access to the operation zone to

619
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:12,970
access whatever application servers in

620
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:15,490
there and then the application server

621
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,710
having access to both the web as well as

622
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,809
to the paths as well as the secure

623
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:21,370
restricted zone to access the database

624
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,260
and respond to any application calls

625
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,690
that mean that that it made so you can

626
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:28,779
see for rules and I have a pretty

627
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:30,660
standard web app that function

628
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:35,850
right and I've got itsc 22 zoning done

629
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,770
so I'm not foregoing any zoning and if I

630
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,540
show this to any directory or sea level

631
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,670
they'll see all my zone tell my zones in

632
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,860
my names so you can see I'm not I'm not

633
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,140
foregoing a lot of the work that was

634
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,060
done historically and I'm keeping some

635
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,710
artifacts of that to sort of make my to

636
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,390
help navigating the politics a little

637
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,160
bit simpler when it comes to introducing

638
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,590
a I like to think a groundbreaking new

639
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:05,639
technology like this yeah

640
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,390
yep 100% you could that you could

641
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:20,230
effectively set up a isolation tag that

642
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,330
you throw on to a VM once you determine

643
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,120
it's isolated and then it has access to

644
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,679
nothing your first rule the top of your

645
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:28,570
rule base would be if you have this tag

646
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:33,100
draw it's then black hold right easy way

647
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,080
to isolate a NACA box without having an

648
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,870
AK right so it's a really good use case

649
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:43,690
I like to use teen iam is a really good

650
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,250
one because tinium is a very hard

651
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,049
product it's a very unique product and

652
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:48,870
its functionality

653
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:51,780
tinium does a lot of peer-to-peer

654
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,370
communications between its agents when

655
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:57,490
they're on the same subnets and that was

656
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:01,840
a problem that I had solved but I wanted

657
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,520
to present to you guys because I thought

658
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,580
it was a very unique problem I don't see

659
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,070
this a lot with other products but you

660
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,169
know the problem think about it you say

661
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,360
all my all my agents on all my systems

662
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,049
need to communicate in peer to peer well

663
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:19,679
how does that work when the native

664
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,510
policy on all my VM to VM communication

665
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:27,730
is do not allow right well what I do the

666
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,320
solution to that is basically another

667
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,860
Global Service rule if you look I'm

668
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,660
basically saying that for peer to peer

669
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,390
communication I'm going to allow prod to

670
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:40,030
talk to prod on the service that Amy

671
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,669
amuses you know a lot of staging to talk

672
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:44,590
to staging on the service that state

673
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:47,140
that tinium uses so what I'm doing is

674
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:52,980
I'm I'm creating logical segments for

675
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,169
communication between the agents within

676
00:31:56,169 --> 00:31:58,660
their respective environments that will

677
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,610
not inhibit the functionality of the

678
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:04,270
product but that will you know keep it

679
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,860
functioning and I'm delivering it as a

680
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,340
common or as a global service across my

681
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,520
environment right and then finally I'm

682
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,070
saying my entire data center has access

683
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,020
to my central tain iam server

684
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,370
so again if you're not familiar with

685
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,770
Dane iam that's this is a bit of a moot

686
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,480
point might be above your head but in

687
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,950
general this

688
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,590
this is a hard use case to crack when I

689
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,000
when I was first presented with it

690
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,040
because how do you deal with period

691
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,170
communication right in a micro segmented

692
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:36,640
environment it doesn't necessarily work

693
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,180
alright so let's talk about centralized

694
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,250
policy management because this is a very

695
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,730
very important key to success for a

696
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:49,790
micro segment to deployment if you have

697
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:52,640
the option go with a vendor that allows

698
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,530
you to do centralized policy management

699
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,770
if you don't have the option go with a

700
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,600
third party solution integrates with

701
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,870
multiple systems because I will tell you

702
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,600
that if if you're not consistent in your

703
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,710
policy deployment you will have a lot of

704
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,620
problems

705
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:14,750
personally I used a checkpoint when I

706
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:19,490
did the deployment and it natively has

707
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:20,990
centralized management and allows

708
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,550
multiple policies to be created on a

709
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,170
manager and pushed independently to

710
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,810
multiple systems so I found that one to

711
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:30,830
be a compelling product but in this case

712
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,240
I mean a afford net does this

713
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,320
centralized management's a little harder

714
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,410
with for Donets in my opinion but you

715
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:43,310
know from a centralized policy

716
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,050
perspective most people don't have green

717
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:47,240
fields and will need to go with a third

718
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,800
with a third party firewall policy

719
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,570
software so something like a fire

720
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,730
monitor and I'll go SEC will definitely

721
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,990
fit the bill there now does anybody

722
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,570
remember what we talked about earlier as

723
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,600
being the one of the big problems of

724
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,680
micro seg yeah we talked about logging

725
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,070
right how much log traffic has generated

726
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,710
by traditional firewalls a ton everybody

727
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,449
wants it in their sim or in their

728
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:17,239
central log repo well what happens is

729
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,800
when I put a firewall in front of every

730
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,980
VM

731
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:33,719
yeah you asked for it so most

732
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,820
organizations will have predefined

733
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,940
security policies or policies that say

734
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,500
that you have to log all firewall

735
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,149
traffic that's gonna be a big problem in

736
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:48,440
this case I would suggest looking at

737
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,560
whether or not you can whitelist or not

738
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,719
log some common or global services

739
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,660
things like DNS things like ntp if you

740
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,300
can avoid it see if you can pull those

741
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,220
log or that data source from somewhere

742
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,870
else other than a firewall that would be

743
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:10,590
logged in this information I would say

744
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,570
that most sims do scale out and they can

745
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,060
definitely accommodate the volume but

746
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:20,130
your licensing might be a big threshold

747
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,260
to entry for that since most sims do

748
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,390
volume based licensing she's gonna be a

749
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,420
big issue so one of the ways that we've

750
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:31,830
gotten around it personally we like to

751
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,770
use I I would suggest using either a

752
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,930
centralized log repo that doesn't do

753
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,630
volume based licensing or we use a

754
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,300
product our sim internally a bright sky

755
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,480
is QRadar and curator allows you to

756
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,600
bypass the license to just log stuff to

757
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,990
a log repo as a two-in-one so I can send

758
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,330
stuff to my sim or consents off to my

759
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,070
centralized log repo which is all part

760
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,140
of the same infrastructure so very

761
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,730
flexible but I mean there's lots of ways

762
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:05,570
to to depth to get around this problem

763
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:20,540
