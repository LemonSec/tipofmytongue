[Music]

2
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:09,900
like we said I'm gonna talk a little bit

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,120
more about me in a second but today

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,139
we're gonna be talking about the red

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,710
hunting part of why this talk came to be

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,600
is because I was going to a lot of

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,910
conferences in all the threat hunting

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,699
talks were like super high level showing

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,199
code very very narrow in scope so what I

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,330
did was to try to take a step back and

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,850
kind of bring my kind of my philosophy

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,780
of how we get to do them some threat

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,520
hunting this is an advanced for some

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,430
people who are very newer to security

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,710
and it's a lot of misconceptions so I'm

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,750
gonna try to clear some of those up here

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,170
today to start to do that and kind of

18
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,420
frame the conversation I want to use

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,719
this number 62 percent and the

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,930
importance of this number is as follows

21
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,640
and I apologize it looks a little bit

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,789
but I think we can make what it says

23
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:04,409
there was a survey by crowd reached

24
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,450
research partners a couple of years ago

25
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,670
where they asked which of the following

26
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,439
that you considered to be the top

27
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,350
challenge that your security team is

28
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,689
facing surprisingly enough this was the

29
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,970
answer 62 percent said it's the

30
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,759
detection of advanced threats the hidden

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,850
unknown and the emerging stuff so

32
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,790
basically the stuff that we cannot

33
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,799
readily see out there on our networks

34
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,100
and systems what we're gonna do here

35
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,920
today is show you how you can carve a

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,979
path from a reactive security defensive

37
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,619
operation to a more proactive one go

38
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,600
find those bad things before they find

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,409
you

40
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,119
we're going to talk about how threat

41
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,890
hunting is different from forensics and

42
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,170
Incident Response what is it that we

43
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,350
need to do threat hunting how you're

44
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,509
going to do this a lot of people ask

45
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,390
this what do I look for I don't know

46
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,180
what I'm doing how do I start what tools

47
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,250
do we use right tools are always gonna

48
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,409
be important who is the hunter who is

49
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:08,818
the person who's going to be doing all

50
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,119
this good stuff

51
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:12,940
and more important what is that you can

52
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,730
do right now or Monday when you go back

53
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,489
to the office to start having these

54
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:19,660
discussions where your leaders and what

55
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,120
not and your engineers and technicians

56
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,459
and analysts and all that to start doing

57
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:26,590
this in the office so let's go ahead and

58
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,489
dig right into the topic

59
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:34,030
who is this guy like Chris upset I've

60
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,099
been working in the banking industry in

61
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:38,799
the US and Chicago been doing IT for 20

62
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:41,560
years I started breaking things and I

63
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,840
have to put does anybody know what that

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,500
computer is Thank You Commodore 64 so

65
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,239
that I always put it up there because

66
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:51,730
that is what started this IT passion for

67
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,510
me I went to store saw it on a display

68
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,209
and fell in love with it when I was I

69
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:01,870
don't know 13 14 so that's what started

70
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,239
everything so these days up again like

71
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,420
Chris said I run a blue team in the

72
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,129
banking sector we do Incident Response

73
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:11,370
for insects insider threat and

74
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,959
everything else that nobody else wants

75
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:16,739
to do so that's a lot of stuff all right

76
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,970
lawyers make me say it opinions are my

77
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,340
own there do not reflect the views of my

78
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,930
employer so with that out of the way

79
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,690
let's get to the good stuff so what is

80
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,880
that we've been doing when we have some

81
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,620
issues with security incidents and

82
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,200
problems and whatnot it's the same thing

83
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,060
a lot of people do the same thing over

84
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,540
and over and over we employ to some

85
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,269
extent the concept of the security

86
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:42,160
operation center always we see there in

87
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,470
the picture if you are a big company and

88
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,819
you have a lot of money you have

89
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:48,010
something like or we see up there in the

90
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,049
picture sadly not everybody has that so

91
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:54,549
to some extent you have something maybe

92
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:57,430
you subcontract that to one security

93
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,739
provider out there but it's kind of the

94
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,019
same concept the problem with the

95
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:05,769
approach is that it's very rule heavy we

96
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:08,230
are looking for things mostly based on

97
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,160
signatures we've been doing that forever

98
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,160
antivirus your seems has have a defined

99
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,029
rules and things like that and yeah it

100
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,560
works I mean we leverage the usual

101
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,140
suspects IPS firewalls your endpoint you

102
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,130
throw up all

103
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,710
your seam and you come up with some

104
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,380
magic and detections and whatnot the

105
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,600
problem with the approach it's highly

106
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,960
reactive okay

107
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,100
begs the question what about the unknown

108
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,990
what if we don't have a signature for

109
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,430
something there's something new out

110
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,770
there there's something that we just

111
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,360
don't know how to detect because the

112
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,030
vendor has not pushed any kind of

113
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,640
signature so how we're gonna solve that

114
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:54,730
problem we are highly reactive okay that

115
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,040
that again that's that's kind of a big

116
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,440
problem for a lot of people out there we

117
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,480
want to think that we are you know cyber

118
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,360
warriors we put our armor on and we are

119
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,640
ready to go and fight evil in our

120
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,680
network so we want to tackle all the

121
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,930
alerts that we see which for some

122
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,210
environments that's a lot lead to

123
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,290
fatigue and whatnot but we follow what

124
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,470
miss says contain eradicate recover do

125
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,810
the lessons learned rinse wash and

126
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,370
repeat we start doing the same thing all

127
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,540
over again but still we are just doing

128
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,910
this based on the things that we know we

129
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,190
cannot attack the stuff that we don't

130
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,910
know it's a problem we become then stuck

131
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,430
in a loop like I said rinse wash repeat

132
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,960
we're doing the same thing over and over

133
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,680
and over right the bad guys there they

134
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,170
are looking for the new and good stuff

135
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:51,130
to keep attacking us so we're falling

136
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,910
behind that's just no doubt ok we're so

137
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,540
busy we just don't have the time to

138
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,790
start doing other things and kind of

139
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,160
start thinking outside of the box how we

140
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,410
can improve processes and things like

141
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,600
that we fall into what's called a

142
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,960
capability trap we do what we know how

143
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,740
to do look at the seam look at the logs

144
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,270
match it against something if it doesn't

145
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,810
match it's all good nothing is happening

146
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,730
the problem is that at some point we're

147
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,200
gonna have low confidence in those

148
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,320
alerts because again it's new stuff

149
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,720
there's some gaps in there somewhere we

150
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,860
just don't know what they are because

151
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,620
we're not taking a deep look at all the

152
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,750
stuff going on and those gaps usually

153
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,910
for themselves in the shape of something

154
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,460
that's missing sure we see a network

155
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,900
alert but how do we translate that to

156
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,980
something in Active Directory or

157
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,600
something or some other thing how about

158
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,750
our applications we we lack some

159
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,870
visibility so logs as a result we cannot

160
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,090
make intelligent decisions about those

161
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,430
things that we're seeing like I

162
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,890
mentioned the process is just not

163
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,950
improving it stays the same security

164
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,400
operations are not maturing at all

165
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,419
we are staying just the way they are and

166
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,350
yeah like I said the guys are just

167
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:18,490
advancing a crazy crazy pace that begs

168
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,560
the question then what do we do what are

169
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,140
we gonna do now obviously we need

170
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,260
something new because whatever we're

171
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:31,270
doing could be better okay there's no

172
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,450
need to reinvent the wheel we're gonna

173
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,669
see how you work with what you have

174
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,220
right now in your environment

175
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,200
some people think advancing security

176
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,440
means getting a blind check and buying a

177
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,940
whole bunch of tools and things and hire

178
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,830
a bunch of people sure that works if

179
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,150
you're in the news because you got

180
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,560
breach and they give you the blind check

181
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,800
but hopefully that's not you the way

182
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,300
that we gotta solve this is by moving

183
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,350
towards a more proactive approach okay

184
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,729
remember we want to go looking for

185
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:06,040
trouble before it finds us and I used

186
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,310
this quote from Scott Roberts if you

187
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,560
know sans he's one of their instructors

188
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,260
he says that reactive organizations with

189
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,460
which are the ones that we just

190
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,820
described they kick off an incident in

191
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,310
three ways the first one is when some

192
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,050
sort of alert comes in intrusion

193
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,610
detection some other seem hit something

194
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,300
like that you get a call and again this

195
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,429
is you know tailor for the u.s. if the

196
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,610
FBI or some other element of law calls

197
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,799
you saying hey did you know that we are

198
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,780
seeing some activity in your systems

199
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,969
that are publicly facing doing X or Y or

200
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:47,140
Z or the third way is if you follow

201
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,070
Brian Krebs you know security

202
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,500
journalist or somebody like that calls

203
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,200
you hey could you give us a comment for

204
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,149
a story that we're working on on why

205
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:00,459
your customer database is exposed

206
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:02,709
publicly on the web and we can see older

207
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,709
information right again you are reacting

208
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:08,200
to something you're not looking for

209
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,350
trouble before it finds you and here's

210
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,850
where threat hunting is going to enter

211
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,690
right we do not need about an arrow

212
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,890
we're gonna see how we're gonna tackle

213
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,000
this problem by by doing you know some

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,589
things amazing like common sense but

215
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:25,600
maybe we just don't see them again

216
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,779
because we're just too busy and whatnot

217
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:31,529
Scott then moves on to say that when

218
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,050
organizations change from reactive to

219
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,440
proactive by using thread hunting the

220
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,529
team the incident response team is gonna

221
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:45,370
go and look for that activity okay and

222
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,800
look for trouble before trouble finds us

223
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,350
and it's gonna be based on a number of

224
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,490
things it could be patterns of activity

225
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,760
some threat intelligence and I cannot

226
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,029
emphasize this enough just a hunch we

227
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:02,829
can do threat hunting using something

228
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:04,540
that we believe might be happening we're

229
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,740
gonna see an example of that in a minute

230
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,279
okay once that happens the hunting team

231
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,430
does their thing then the result of that

232
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,470
it's going to be fed up to incident

233
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,870
response it gets codified into some sort

234
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,510
of automatic detection and it becomes

235
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,149
business as usual and you move on to the

236
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:24,250
next hunt more to come on that process

237
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,000
also in a second before we say what

238
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,459
threat hunting is well I always like to

239
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:32,470
start by saying what it's not because

240
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,240
I've heard all kinds of stories out

241
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,839
there I would like to debunk them so

242
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,290
it's not magic or a unicorn some people

243
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,870
say oh okay I have a problem I need to

244
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,940
mature my operations I'm gonna do a

245
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,190
threat hunting and I'm gonna be the

246
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,380
elite at what I do a detection in

247
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,980
response and all of that well you could

248
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,279
get there sure but you need to mature in

249
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,779
the threat hunting space it's not like

250
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:00,940
you one day say oh let's hunt and go and

251
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,360
do it

252
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,880
fortunately doesn't work like that it's

253
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,750
not a synonym for

254
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,350
this is a living process okay you do it

255
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,380
you iterate you enhance you your

256
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,590
defenses you collect more data you

257
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,110
analyze it and it's gonna take some time

258
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,470
it's a living process it's not something

259
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,530
you can just forget about it's not what

260
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,800
some vendors say it is and I kid you not

261
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,690
some vendors are going to tell you a

262
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,080
hundred percent automated threat hunting

263
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,320
no such thing okay we're gonna see how

264
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,480
threat hunting always involves somebody

265
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,240
a human and analyst making decisions

266
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,690
okay now there's a lot of fine vendors

267
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,130
that the ones like the ones that we have

268
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,860
here on site they are going to tell you

269
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,790
where they fit into a threat hunting

270
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,050
process those are the guys that you want

271
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,550
to talk to not the guy that's going to

272
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,100
tell you that they have d-v definitive

273
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,490
answer the threat hunting okay buzz word

274
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,510
that's the other thing that I hear

275
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,420
people say oh that is like next

276
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,030
generation this or next generation dad

277
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,790
or that is that is a buzz word it's not

278
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,070
like I said vendors are talking about

279
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,940
this there's a lot of things that can be

280
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,500
proven how this improve security

281
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,030
operations so certainly not a buzz word

282
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:25,150
with that begs the question again what

283
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,660
is this threat hunting thing if anybody

284
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,900
knows a David Bianco he he's been doing

285
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,520
threat hunting work for years he works

286
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,250
now for target the stores out there in

287
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,520
the US he defines it the following way

288
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,910
is the collective name of techniques to

289
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,790
discover malicious activity that the

290
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,300
automated systems missed again because

291
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,070
it's new there's no signature or

292
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,890
anything and the hunt will always

293
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,680
involve a human if it's fully automated

294
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,120
it's not hunting thanked enough that

295
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,890
we're not in a state where the computers

296
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,600
can make decisions for us because we

297
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,820
would be out of jobs we'll still need

298
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,400
those engineers analysts and people

299
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,589
looking at those logs to kind of fill

300
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:14,020
the gaps made the connections and decide

301
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,709
how to move on

302
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,590
why do we do the hunting but we need to

303
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,210
cover those gaps that we said a few

304
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,150
slides ago right we want to identify

305
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:28,110
that undetected compromise with the

306
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,270
purpose of fitting it back to the

307
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,420
incident response team remember that the

308
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,040
people who gonna be doing the hunting in

309
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,770
a mature organization they're not gonna

310
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,640
go you know patch or grab forensic

311
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,410
images or things like that your threat

312
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,760
hunters are going through threat hunt

313
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,830
they need to pass the results to your

314
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,760
Incident Response people okay

315
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,800
automating detection becomes the job

316
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,910
after threat hunting okay so when we say

317
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,830
cannot be fully automated that doesn't

318
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,810
mean automation does not play an

319
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,720
important role good because it does okay

320
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,740
the end of the day you want to reduce

321
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,980
your attack surface and respond faster

322
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,510
to your incidents so that's that's

323
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,860
basically what we're trying to achieve

324
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,400
here to do that we kind of need to

325
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,610
rewire the way that we're thinking a lot

326
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,620
of places are gonna be stuck again in

327
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,690
that loop but you need to take a pause

328
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,990
and say you know what what are we going

329
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,030
to do different let's get those gears

330
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,270
turning generating ideas discussing kind

331
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,130
of selling the threat hunting concept

332
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,750
we're also gonna see how to do that in a

333
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,960
minute and we need to adapt to what the

334
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,810
bad guys are doing we were just behind

335
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,690
as defenders this no no point in trying

336
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,330
to obscure that fact there's the bad

337
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,840
guys they gotta get it right one time we

338
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,700
have to get it right all the time so we

339
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,110
have to be adapting to what they're

340
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,910
doing we need to reduce that

341
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,550
investigation time if anybody saw the

342
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,340
talk by CrowdStrike they talked about

343
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,710
this we need to do this in a faster

344
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,900
manner we need to identify incidents

345
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,570
quicker we need to be able to respond to

346
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,820
them quicker and that is part of how

347
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,530
we're going to solve that problem by

348
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,240
doing things like thinking in a

349
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,900
proactive manner I like to explain

350
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,200
threat hunting and I forget the

351
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,610
gentleman's name that spoke right here

352
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,800
before me from cyber bid he was talking

353
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,050
about people process and technology that

354
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,300
is in my opinion what

355
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,490
everything comes down to in the security

356
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,560
space okay because those three things

357
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,900
need to work together otherwise we're

358
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,570
not gonna achieve anything right I see

359
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:39,930
it

360
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,330
I say tripod because imagine if you have

361
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,340
a camera and you put it right here you

362
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,100
need those three legs of the tripod to

363
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,340
be at the same distance height if you

364
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,690
have one shorter than the other the

365
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,130
whole thing is just gonna fall down it's

366
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,420
not gonna work you're gonna lose your

367
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,880
expensive camera so they need to work in

368
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,400
unison together pulling in the same

369
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,490
direction they are all equally important

370
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,490
let's take a look at each one of those

371
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,770
the process this is the one space where

372
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,050
I get a lot of questions a lot of people

373
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,270
say I don't know this is threat hunting

374
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,550
sure how do I do it is it IOC s is it

375
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,580
this is it dad see a little bit how

376
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,240
we're gonna attack that that part

377
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,750
maturity model like I said your

378
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,340
companies are each one I'm pretty sure

379
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,140
in some different state we may have here

380
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,630
people who just building a security team

381
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,080
but you may be you may be for working

382
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,820
for a big company that has a whole bunch

383
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,800
of people and you have a threat hunting

384
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,050
team you're looking how to improve as

385
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,980
you can see here in the maturity model

386
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,260
you may start at level zero all the way

387
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,440
on the left you rely on a lot of

388
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,180
automated alerts because that's all you

389
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,280
have you just have maybe intrusion

390
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,460
detection prevention and antivirus and a

391
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,890
couple of things maybe you're not

392
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,410
collecting a lot of data remember that

393
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,240
one of the key things for threat hunting

394
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,150
is gonna be collecting a lot of logs

395
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,040
doing some analysis and coming to some

396
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,190
conclusions based on that as you move

397
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:15,000
through the maturity levels you you may

398
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,069
take I don't know a month six months a

399
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,589
year a couple of years don't right or

400
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,300
wrong answer here the idea is that you

401
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,210
always gonna be shifting right until you

402
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,329
go all the way to level four which means

403
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:31,880
that you have a lot of automation okay

404
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,380
you're collecting a lot of data about

405
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,250
everything

406
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,310
and when I say collecting data I mean

407
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:41,130
useful data that doesn't mean you

408
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,770
collect every log about every single

409
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,420
because I don't know anybody who has an

410
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,580
unlimited budget I'm at the time you

411
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,170
throw all of that into your steam

412
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,150
platforms you're paying for ingesting

413
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,520
all that data most likely and it gets

414
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,260
expensive really really quick so you

415
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,260
want to make targeted collections of

416
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,150
data that is valuable from an incident

417
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,160
response perspective and again it's

418
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,260
going to thank you some time to kind of

419
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,850
understand what is it that you need to

420
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,040
collect in detail but the key is that

421
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,440
you enter the maturity model at some

422
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,630
stage and you're going to progress at X

423
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,470
pace

424
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,720
you cannot say I'm gonna be there next

425
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,280
month I'm gonna be there in two months

426
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,950
it may take some time realize that but

427
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,190
the key is that you grow you don't start

428
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,809
with a perfect hunting operation right

429
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:30,380
off the bat okay

430
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,030
the other big question I always get I

431
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,490
don't understand how do I look for the

432
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,220
things that I don't know yeah it's it's

433
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,840
understandable sounds like kind of

434
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,910
counterintuitive it's like go find

435
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,350
something and I'm gonna tell you what it

436
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,800
is yeah I could be a problem but we have

437
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,280
a four step process here that as the

438
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,750
definition that we're using for threat

439
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,570
hunting said we can base it on threat

440
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,460
intelligence it could be just a hunch or

441
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,130
some pattern of activity something that

442
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,010
you know for example that the bad guys

443
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,980
are doing if you know that you said you

444
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,460
read an article and you see that some

445
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,780
actor bad actor is using X technique to

446
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,090
move laterally well you can feed that in

447
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,470
here and you can say okay I'm gonna

448
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,340
create a hypotheses I saw that a PT 27

449
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,890
is using this technique to move

450
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,820
laterally okay that's good build it into

451
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,410
the process you don't know right off the

452
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,450
bat if that's in your systems because

453
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,309
you don't have a rule for that specific

454
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:40,080
thing you're gonna go ahead and create a

455
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,960
hypotheses I think there's somebody in

456
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,450
my systems doing this in this manner

457
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,880
okay you're gonna go ahead and move to

458
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,140
the second step which is the

459
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,660
investigation and this is gonna be a

460
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,980
learning experience because you're gonna

461
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,620
realize a few things most likely that

462
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,850
you don't have all the logs that you

463
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,510
need

464
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,280
so does your first lesson learned you

465
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,330
wanna learn what data you need to

466
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:04,110
capture to analyze those logs okay that

467
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,230
can lead to a whole bunch of other

468
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,090
questions how do we centralize the data

469
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,730
but again big learning experience but

470
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,350
let's assume for a second that you do

471
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,410
have the logs okay you go ahead and

472
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:19,230
analyze them okay you go ahead and then

473
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,540
uncover new patters and tactics

474
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,809
techniques and procedures with the data

475
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:27,150
that you capture you should be able to

476
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,070
answer some questions that you may have

477
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,890
about the activity like I said this

478
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,600
could be based on something that you saw

479
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,049
on the news or something like that and

480
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:39,240
that is what you would do in that step

481
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,070
from there you move to the analytics

482
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,549
step you have to enrich your data just

483
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:46,320
looking at one log it's just not going

484
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,240
to cut it you need to add more

485
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,250
information statistics data stacking

486
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:58,080
outliers all kinds of ways to just sift

487
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,520
through all that information that you're

488
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,110
getting and being able to make it in

489
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,780
something actionable ideally what's

490
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,030
going to happen at the end of that

491
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,919
you're gonna have completed the cycle of

492
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,190
your hunt and that could be codified

493
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,860
into some sort of detection that can be

494
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,990
automated okay

495
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,020
taking another step back if you don't

496
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,910
have threat intelligence or you just

497
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,630
don't have anything you can say oh okay

498
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,490
my critical data is in my database

499
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,160
that's where my crown jewels are well my

500
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,130
hypotheses is that somebody I don't know

501
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,510
let's say a system administrator for

502
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,210
example I think some of my system admins

503
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,190
are logging on to my database they're

504
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,200
dumping all that data and they're

505
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,230
exfiltrating it through whatever USB

506
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:46,940
sticks or Dropbox or something like that

507
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,150
again

508
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,169
you walk the process again tools and

509
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:54,120
techniques ok go look at your database

510
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,059
logs are you seeing some dumps happening

511
00:21:56,059 --> 00:21:58,380
where are they coming from or what time

512
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,200
are they're happening do you see any

513
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,110
network activity following that see now

514
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,500
we pivot to network and point activity

515
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,230
do we see any endpoints being logged on

516
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,029
whatever time this stuff is happening a

517
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:15,100
lot of activity on end points do you see

518
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,010
any proxy traffic happening at those

519
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,789
times so by the time you analyze all

520
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:24,279
those different logs and things you may

521
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:27,070
uncover the pattern the pattern being

522
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:31,210
people download to the desktop encrypted

523
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,809
zip it something push it out again USB

524
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:37,299
sticks or proxies or something very

525
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:39,549
simple case but again it shows you how

526
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:42,220
with just a simple hypothesis you can

527
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,519
walk through that once you identify that

528
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:47,769
you would just run through the analytics

529
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:50,049
portion and you can look for the same

530
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:53,529
activity in other computers and that

531
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:56,470
could help paint a good picture of what

532
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:01,929
is going on right the other question

533
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:04,330
that I get I don't know what I'm looking

534
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,490
for I don't understand this hunch thing

535
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,130
I am NOT creative I don't know what's

536
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,490
going on well mitre is gonna be a

537
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,470
solution for dad if I could see a show

538
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,240
of hands who's familiar with a mitre

539
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,539
attack framework oh this gets me excited

540
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:22,029
when I started doing this talk I would

541
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:26,110
mention mitre and everybody what is

542
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,320
mitre so for those of you I'm excited to

543
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,399
see that a lot of people are aware

544
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:32,919
hopefully you're leveraging the miter

545
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:35,710
the word that Myer is doing in with the

546
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,510
attack framework because this is part of

547
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,279
how we're gonna you know kind of try to

548
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:42,490
get ahead adversarial tactics techniques

549
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,580
and common knowledge framework for cyber

550
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,010
adversary behavior the work that mitre

551
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,039
did was they analyzed a whole bunch of

552
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,990
intrusions and attacks out there and

553
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,649
they said let's find what's common here

554
00:23:56,649 --> 00:23:59,139
what kind of behaviors are we seeing in

555
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:01,510
those attacks where there's a lot of

556
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:05,019
information published on how they were

557
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:08,380
done okay as you can see at the bottom

558
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,169
here we have the kill chain the work the

559
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:14,350
mitre is doing is concentrated on the on

560
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,620
the last steps of the kill chain because

561
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,960
all they care is for people that made it

562
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,419
through our defenses they don't care

563
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,400
about all the initial you know

564
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,040
recon and all that stuff they want to

565
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,770
solve the problem of we have people

566
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,290
inside how are we going to detect and

567
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:36,940
fix this issue okay fantastic starting

568
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,680
point for the people who say I don't

569
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,110
know hi I'm how I'm going to attack this

570
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,930
problem what mitre did again they

571
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:46,660
categorize in a matrix the techniques

572
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,330
that they saw that the bad actors were

573
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,450
using maybe a little bit small for the

574
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,800
people on the back but you can go to my

575
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,570
ders website and see this in more detail

576
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:59,530
so what they did here it said well these

577
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:00,910
are the things that we're observing

578
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:04,930
initial access execution and so forth

579
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,700
and so on lateral movement

580
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,160
exfiltration we're seeing some

581
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,200
commonalities in the things that are

582
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,160
happening out there

583
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,470
for example let's assume let's take

584
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,810
lateral movement they said what have we

585
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,960
observed in those attacks from a

586
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,600
technique perspective well we saw people

587
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,210
using AppleScript application deployment

588
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:28,720
software we saw people using logon

589
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,260
scripts

590
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:33,450
okay what about how they exfiltrate data

591
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,360
also a lot of automated exfiltration

592
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,250
compression encryption doing rate

593
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,600
limiting slow and constant exfiltration

594
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,080
over some other protocols so now we have

595
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,370
something that we can use to base our

596
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:54,340
our investigation into what might be

597
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,520
happening we can start looking for all

598
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,590
this stuff right here we can build it

599
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:03,370
into the process and again look for the

600
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:06,430
unknown okay we may not have an alert

601
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,360
but we can start doing for example if we

602
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,030
take the data transfer size limit we can

603
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,000
start looking to our proxy logs or

604
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,440
something like that to see the outgoing

605
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,440
traffic we do some analysis and we can

606
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,080
do some nice visualizations and kind of

607
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,750
come to an understanding of where there

608
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,650
might be some anomalies okay as you can

609
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,570
see a lot of these things live in

610
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,270
different areas we're talking about

611
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,850
dll's here we're talking about proxy

612
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,010
stuff

613
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,350
you're gonna have to find out a lot of

614
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,090
information about your network that you

615
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,130
may or may not have so please do keep

616
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,160
that in mind it's gonna be a lot of a

617
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,390
learning experience I was listening to

618
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,220
the talk the other day on zero trust

619
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,830
this is kind of similar to zero trust

620
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,350
you cannot implement threat hunting or

621
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,540
sear trust models overnight it's

622
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,530
something that takes a little bit of

623
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,090
investigation understanding your

624
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,090
networks your systems and yeah just

625
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,650
learning and adapting to the things that

626
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,150
you're going to be seeing out there on

627
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:15,130
your networks the automation we said

628
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,620
it's sure we cannot fully automate but

629
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,780
one of our goals is going to be not

630
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,530
doing the same hunts twice okay you do

631
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:26,020
your hunt you follow your loop and the

632
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,120
result of that could be automated

633
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,400
because it becomes a detection and

634
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,320
automate a detection that use case is

635
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,680
proven you move on to the next thing

636
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,790
send that over to your Incident Response

637
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:40,150
people and that's it you try another

638
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,240
approach some other technique some other

639
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,800
hunch maybe you have some threat

640
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,300
intelligence suggesting that there's

641
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,400
something else going on so that is what

642
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,530
you do never do the same hunts twice so

643
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:56,440
that's that's basically a 10,000 feet

644
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,510
overview into the process from there we

645
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,060
move on to talk about the people

646
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,400
remember people process and technology

647
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,570
and this is super important I like to

648
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,550
say you know that there the three legs

649
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:12,190
of the tripod are important but I would

650
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,400
say people place a big big role when I

651
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,050
say threat hunting some people think of

652
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,070
somebody if you seen the Mission

653
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,080
Impossible movies so somebody like Ethan

654
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,240
Hunt somebody who has the the gadgets

655
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,910
the sticky gloves he can come from the

656
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,350
ceiling and do the thing where he

657
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,030
doesn't trip the pressure sensors down

658
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,430
there on the vault but that's not really

659
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,900
who we need we don't need somebody with

660
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,280
all the gadgets and anything like that

661
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,440
we need somebody more like Brian Mills

662
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,080
from the movie taken somebody with a

663
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,180
particular set of skills that they have

664
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:44,110
acquired over a long career if you put a

665
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,810
new guy to the threat hunting and I'm

666
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:50,590
saying a new guy to security that might

667
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,610
be difficult okay

668
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,620
need somebody who understands some

669
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,580
things that we're gonna see right now

670
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,420
threat hunter needs to know

671
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,240
cybersecurity that's kind of a given but

672
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,360
I have to discuss it because some people

673
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:09,450
I've seen cases where people pull

674
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,330
employees from I don't know helpdesk

675
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,960
telecommunications and they bring them

676
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,940
into security they don't given the right

677
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,130
training they expect them to do things

678
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,290
like threat hunting that I you know kind

679
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,840
of advanced so you're just setting

680
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,340
people up for failure if you're doing

681
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,350
that right you need somebody who at

682
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,929
least understands cyber somebody who

683
00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:31,570
understands the threat landscape what is

684
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,640
it that's going on out there

685
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,010
what are they what's new and hard the

686
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:39,100
latest trends in ransomware or attacks

687
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,799
or all that stuff somebody who can keep

688
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:46,000
tabs on what the bad guys are doing

689
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,309
threat int'l knowledge comes in super

690
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:50,980
handy you wanted to have a wide skill

691
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,880
set if you have a guy who's an expert

692
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,250
let's pick something Cisco

693
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:01,179
he's a networking guru CCIE he wrote the

694
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:04,630
book on this and dad sure he's gonna

695
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,669
bring some value for a better hunting

696
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:08,890
team from a network perspective but what

697
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,290
about if he does not understand other

698
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:15,010
things forensics or something like that

699
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,049
that's gonna be somewhat limited so

700
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,820
ideally somebody doesn't have to be an

701
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,530
expert in everything but a wider skill

702
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,179
set may bring a little you know more

703
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:24,340
value than somebody who's an expert in

704
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,160
one thing if you have somebody who can

705
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,370
read or code write read or write code

706
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,559
that's always a plus this is something

707
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,480
that I always I see out there in the

708
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,059
wild also people who lack those skills

709
00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:39,190
so if there's some sort of obfuscation

710
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:41,620
or something they may miss that so

711
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,280
that's a big plus soft skills should be

712
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,140
one of the recurring themes I've heard

713
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,340
in other talks

714
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,710
you wanna these people need to be able

715
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,960
to communicate what they're seeing a lot

716
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,760
of this stuff is highly highly advanced

717
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,010
highly technical people need to be able

718
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,049
to abstract that to send it up the chain

719
00:30:59,049 --> 00:30:59,870
of command

720
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:03,500
and make an actual for them a security

721
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,150
professionals part of our job is to

722
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,850
translate this stuff into risk how does

723
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:11,420
the business how does this translate for

724
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,400
the business from a risk perspective so

725
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,800
you need to have somebody who can help

726
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,950
you do that and then last but not least

727
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:23,120
team sure it's hard because we cannot

728
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,070
dedicate a whole bunch of people to

729
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,200
threat hunting if we're trying to do

730
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,000
something new but maybe start thinking

731
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,190
about the concept of a hunting team like

732
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,010
I said nobody knows everything even if

733
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,330
you have a white skill set you might

734
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,390
need an expert too and some things that

735
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,800
are particularly important to your

736
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,720
business so make sure you're thinking

737
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,210
longer-term the concept of a team

738
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:48,429
hunting team instead of just one person

739
00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:50,540
what is it that makes a great threat

740
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:54,620
hunter it's a fantastic question did I

741
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,520
was try to present it in four dimensions

742
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,960
okay on the left curiosity you want

743
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,080
somebody who asks questions like what is

744
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,410
this what's going on here I want to know

745
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,590
more I want to go down that rabbit hole

746
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,750
I want to understand why that activity

747
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:18,470
is happening what's going on and what is

748
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,540
this thing that I'm seeing here people

749
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,490
need to be patient also this is gonna

750
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,340
take some time as much as I want to make

751
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,440
sure that we move fast

752
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,780
some of these things they require you

753
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,820
know the precision of a surgeon to do

754
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,429
carve through logs and things like that

755
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:36,350
on the second dimension critical

756
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:39,920
thinking super super important somebody

757
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,670
who likes to solve problems we wanted

758
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,740
somebody first who wants to ask

759
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,480
questions but then now we need somebody

760
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,059
who is going to ask the right questions

761
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:53,750
okay if we're seeing a lot of data going

762
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:58,090
out on the internet from our systems

763
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:00,890
somebody may raise our alarms like oh my

764
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:01,460
god

765
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,520
exfiltration well you know what critical

766
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,520
thinking the guy is gonna say hold on

767
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,230
it's the 30th of the month we're doing

768
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,580
end of month processing

769
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,559
that might be a batch job or something

770
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,170
like that so they should be asking the

771
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,960
right questions we need somebody also

772
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,750
who's open-minded considering

773
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,630
alternatives I hate I hate I hate

774
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,050
confirmation bias a lot of people seek

775
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,730
out to prove what they think it's going

776
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,920
on it's never a good idea always

777
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,630
considered but there might be something

778
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,670
else okay it could be a nation state

779
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,350
breaking in or it could be your finance

780
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,390
people doing end of mom Martha

781
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,030
processing so keep that in mind also

782
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,820
people that think like a Packers this is

783
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,429
super super important kind of ties back

784
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:50,850
to being kind of in touch with what's

785
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,429
going on out there what's hot into the

786
00:33:53,429 --> 00:33:55,020
security news and things like that you

787
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,150
need somebody who can understand what's

788
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:00,330
happening on the threat landscape and go

789
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,179
ahead and try to penetrate your systems

790
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:05,520
or steal data or whatever like the bad

791
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,820
guys would third dimension tech

792
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,760
expertise like I said you cannot expect

793
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,399
people to come from tangentially related

794
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,609
field to come into your threat hunting

795
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:20,219
sure the telecom guys may know a few

796
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:23,070
things about IT but they might not be

797
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,869
the best resource unless you provide

798
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:26,460
them training and you grow them we're

799
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,790
gonna talk about that in slider two

800
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,869
ideally you want somebody who understand

801
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,619
the systems that you have infrastructure

802
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:36,600
if you're on premise sure people who

803
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,520
understand how everything on pram works

804
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,379
if you are a cloud centric company

805
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,090
somebody who understand the flow of data

806
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,460
in the cloud and how all those systems

807
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,070
produce logs and all the stuff that they

808
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,109
do somebody understand your apps

809
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:52,918
forensics who can do data analysis maybe

810
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:55,409
a little bit of reverse engineer all of

811
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:57,869
these things are important things that

812
00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:00,060
are gonna help you you know build that

813
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:04,109
team of threat hunters final dimension

814
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:07,170
and for some reason a lot of people fail

815
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:11,190
at this last one I don't know you can

816
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,930
read there but two plus two equals four

817
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,840
it does not equal a banana or something

818
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,510
else some people just cannot make

819
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,690
connections okay

820
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:22,269
they are seeing data in front of them

821
00:35:22,269 --> 00:35:24,069
and they struggle to answer some

822
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:26,259
questions maybe because they lack the

823
00:35:26,259 --> 00:35:27,700
business context they don't know what's

824
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,640
going on in their business this is not

825
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,440
solely a technical operation you have to

826
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,349
understand the context where your data

827
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:37,779
moves where your systems operate this is

828
00:35:37,779 --> 00:35:39,240
going to be critical

829
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,130
also for connecting the dots finding

830
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,750
patterns this is gonna be something

831
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,660
super important correlating data like I

832
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,809
said business process happening data

833
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:52,180
moving some people sometimes cannot see

834
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,250
that connection you need somebody who's

835
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,769
going to help you paint a picture that

836
00:35:56,769 --> 00:35:59,559
it's any kind of the end goal here so

837
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:02,230
again some ideas to get you going you

838
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,109
may have this talent internally

839
00:36:04,109 --> 00:36:06,309
something else that I want to mention

840
00:36:06,309 --> 00:36:09,819
you could have an ad hoc thread hunting

841
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:11,200
team maybe if you don't have the

842
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,920
resources

843
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,230
maybe you dedicate half of somebody's

844
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,819
time to doing something like this a

845
00:36:15,819 --> 00:36:17,710
quarter whatever helps you know when

846
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,240
you're starting out that's gonna help

847
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,559
you kind of prove your idea and

848
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:24,720
potentially get some resources later on

849
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,430
so from people we move to the last piece

850
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:29,910
of the puzzle which is the technology

851
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:33,369
which I mean we need the tools we

852
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:36,400
absolutely need them and tools are cool

853
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,000
but they can make you a fool there's no

854
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,190
one definitive threat hunting tool I

855
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,740
keep saying that because I see it out

856
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,329
there in the wild people claiming they

857
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,160
have the definitive solution for threat

858
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,960
hunting and the real thing is that every

859
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,640
single company out there where you work

860
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,769
is different you are now gonna have the

861
00:36:56,769 --> 00:36:59,559
same tools the same logs everything so

862
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:01,119
you need to figure out what works for

863
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,140
you understand what you have right now

864
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,690
okay you want to leverage whatever you

865
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:11,589
can like I said if you need Active

866
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:13,299
Directory logs you think that's gonna

867
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:15,430
bring some value if you identified that

868
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:18,130
as a gap go pursue that if you need

869
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:20,920
database endpoint network visibility

870
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,049
you're going to work through identifying

871
00:37:23,049 --> 00:37:26,769
whatever gaps you have and leverage what

872
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:28,329
you can if all you can do it just

873
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,490
centralize your logs with Windows native

874
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,690
tools or what

875
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,549
we have in-house start with that that's

876
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:35,680
gonna allow you to understand more your

877
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,440
data one and second where you need to go

878
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,359
from there what kind of tools you would

879
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:43,270
need to get to that next level start by

880
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:46,380
doing something small see what works I

881
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,539
would say don't run and buy things so

882
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:52,270
people want to sell you things but it's

883
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,400
a matter of due diligence you need to be

884
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,579
able to understand what do you have what

885
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:59,049
are you missing and then move from there

886
00:37:59,049 --> 00:38:02,289
on remember that as hunting matures the

887
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:06,849
tools will do the same thing threat

888
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:08,650
intelligence tools are gonna be super

889
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:12,490
important okay you can start with free

890
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,930
solutions there's a whole bunch of out

891
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:17,020
there we have the alienvault product

892
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,880
here this is something that you can set

893
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,710
up for free you don't have to spend a

894
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:24,609
dollar and find somewhere to to run

895
00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:26,079
things maybe that's gonna give you an

896
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,789
idea start getting your feet wet if this

897
00:38:27,789 --> 00:38:30,609
is new to you if you subscribe to some

898
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:33,430
commercial threat intelligence things

899
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:37,210
like anomaly or record the future these

900
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,250
solutions are very very expensive but

901
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,260
they're highly curated and they

902
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,900
definitely bring a lot of value through

903
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,609
your threat hunting operation because

904
00:38:45,609 --> 00:38:46,930
you're gonna be under you're gonna be

905
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:50,440
getting a lot of fresh data for threats

906
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,339
things get aged so it you're gonna see a

907
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:55,750
difference between a paid solution and a

908
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,099
free solution but again the key here is

909
00:38:57,099 --> 00:38:59,289
that you start somewhere you could start

910
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:00,640
with something free and then as you

911
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,069
identify that your needs are a little

912
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:04,809
bit different you can migrate to

913
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:08,710
something that is a paid product from a

914
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:11,619
network monitoring perspective to this

915
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:13,599
day I don't understand why there's still

916
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,369
a lot of people who don't have this kind

917
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:17,799
of visibility into their networks you

918
00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:20,529
want to understand how data is moving in

919
00:39:20,529 --> 00:39:24,339
your network security onion at the

920
00:39:24,339 --> 00:39:26,619
bottom there it's a it's a free product

921
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:28,660
again I always try to present something

922
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,190
that is free that can get you your that

923
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,020
can get your feet wet you can start

924
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,230
deploying this your network again it

925
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,760
doesn't happen overnight but you can

926
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,190
start playing with it no cost of course

927
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,809
the only cost is going to be the time of

928
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:42,130
the people who are going to be doing

929
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,130
this but it's a it has the

930
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,530
it used to be called bro and it's called

931
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:52,330
Zeke network product which core light is

932
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:55,810
the commercial implementation so again

933
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,160
you see the path you start with

934
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,470
something free later on you can that

935
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,790
knowledge that you gained you can move

936
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,790
on to to app a product that is the same

937
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,740
thing that's going to allow you to see

938
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,330
those conversation that those devices

939
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:09,820
are having on the network this is going

940
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:13,620
to analyze a lot of traffic if there's a

941
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,540
you know clear text passwords you can

942
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,000
see it with that you can analyze SMB

943
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,940
traffic you can see a whole bunch of

944
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,360
stuff understand what devices are doing

945
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,000
on your network east-west traffic that

946
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,800
is essential especially if you're

947
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,440
looking at a lateral movement if you do

948
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,480
not have any kind of segmentation this

949
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,340
becomes even more important because you

950
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,960
need to understand those data flows on

951
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:44,290
your network in in some good detail in

952
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,300
point triage this is gonna be super

953
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,460
super important because a lot of attacks

954
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,490
nowadays people are not trying to breach

955
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,320
our firewalls they're going for fishing

956
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,050
and they're sending garbage to our

957
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:58,390
people hoping they would click and this

958
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:01,330
is a massive massive vector for getting

959
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:04,660
into our networks tools like the Google

960
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:08,290
Rapid Response framework nowadays we

961
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,940
have Velociraptor which is kind of a

962
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:13,450
similar tool again also free it's

963
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,070
another tool that I forgot to include

964
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:18,340
here Cape so a fairly new but all these

965
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,130
tools are going to allow you to do some

966
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:24,640
sort of remote live forensics in the

967
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,560
past we would do forensics by grabbing

968
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,240
whole images of computers and things

969
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,750
like that tools like these they do two

970
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,840
things one you can capture memory

971
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,750
registry and things like that really

972
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,940
really quick you can target them say

973
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,600
they go fine tell me if this registry

974
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,110
key exists in this computer the beauty

975
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:50,620
of these systems again they're free you

976
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,480
can cut you could kind of set your own

977
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,670
one hunt you can say ok show me how many

978
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:58,630
computers have this registry entry

979
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:01,630
they have this DLL in this location and

980
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,759
they also have these other couple of

981
00:42:03,759 --> 00:42:06,549
characteristics so you kind of set up

982
00:42:06,549 --> 00:42:09,369
your hunt in the tool and that you let

983
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:11,559
it run against your systems and you do

984
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:14,109
it only once the the system talks to

985
00:42:14,109 --> 00:42:15,519
your endpoints grabs all that

986
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:17,650
information it's gonna bring it back

987
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:19,569
centrally store their results and then

988
00:42:19,569 --> 00:42:21,970
you can know if you're talking about one

989
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:24,220
computer being compromised are you

990
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,749
talking about a thousand computers being

991
00:42:25,749 --> 00:42:28,690
compromised so these kind of tools super

992
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:29,400
important

993
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,499
from here the logical migration is going

994
00:42:32,499 --> 00:42:36,309
to be towards something like an endpoint

995
00:42:36,309 --> 00:42:38,470
detection response a commercial offering

996
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,359
or something like that but again

997
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:44,920
something to start getting the idea you

998
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,539
need all that data center lie somewhere

999
00:42:46,539 --> 00:42:49,869
okay you need to visualize correlate

1000
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:52,720
find those anomalies you're going to do

1001
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,029
that with some tools elq stack Splunk

1002
00:42:57,029 --> 00:43:00,390
gray log just to mention a couple right

1003
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:03,880
all of these have free versions again

1004
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,819
just so you can get your feet wet if you

1005
00:43:06,819 --> 00:43:08,710
need commercial support you can get all

1006
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,839
that you can you know get commercial

1007
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:12,999
offerings but something to start playing

1008
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:16,479
with so the the the point is that I have

1009
00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:18,549
no resources or no money it's no longer

1010
00:43:18,549 --> 00:43:21,099
a valid excuse do you just need time

1011
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,539
from your people so they can start

1012
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:25,089
deploying some of these tools I think

1013
00:43:25,089 --> 00:43:27,089
about all the things you're gonna throw

1014
00:43:27,089 --> 00:43:30,249
in your centralized repository you want

1015
00:43:30,249 --> 00:43:31,989
to get Windows logs again targeted

1016
00:43:31,989 --> 00:43:35,200
collections that it's not every single

1017
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,390
log because that's a lot of data things

1018
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:39,759
like sis Mon that uh it's gonna let you

1019
00:43:39,759 --> 00:43:41,950
know what processes are running on your

1020
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:44,019
computer's it's gonna hash processes and

1021
00:43:44,019 --> 00:43:45,460
things like that and you can get a lot

1022
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,299
of information out of that antivirus EDR

1023
00:43:49,299 --> 00:43:51,489
logs all that stuff needs to be brought

1024
00:43:51,489 --> 00:43:55,839
into your centralized collection Network

1025
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,390
things if you do not have something like

1026
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:01,269
like C or secure Union or things like

1027
00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:03,190
that start with NetFlow those routers

1028
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,930
have switches those conversations are

1029
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:07,150
gonna bring a lot of value think about

1030
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,759
things like DNS DHCP proxy firewalls

1031
00:44:09,759 --> 00:44:11,739
anything that talks on the net where it

1032
00:44:11,739 --> 00:44:12,280
could bring

1033
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,600
some value think about other less normal

1034
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,490
sources of you will email logs DLP

1035
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,510
vulnerability management tools your

1036
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:24,700
koalas your tenable whatever is it that

1037
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,160
you have it's going to help you feel

1038
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,310
some gap Active Directory database logs

1039
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:31,960
apps and things like that

1040
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,910
a lot of information but hopefully

1041
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,020
you're getting the idea that you can

1042
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,360
start by doing something even if it's

1043
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,130
small so what is it that you're gonna do

1044
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:44,860
when you go back to the office think

1045
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,420
about first - establishing some sort of

1046
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,600
vision like what is it that I want to do

1047
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,730
what do we want to take this who are the

1048
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,710
people do I have anybody in-house who

1049
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:55,540
who might be interested in helping out

1050
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,900
with this what resources do we need this

1051
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,920
is the right time

1052
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,620
if your business is heavy now closing

1053
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,990
the year not the right time please do it

1054
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:07,960
in q1 or q2 or something else in 2020 so

1055
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,240
you will be sending yourself for failure

1056
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,160
if you go back to your office and you

1057
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,080
try to do this stuff when the time is

1058
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,020
not right you may need to socialize that

1059
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,970
concept a lot of people don't understand

1060
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:22,450
what this is we have to sell it to the

1061
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,670
executives you gotta sell it up you're

1062
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:26,110
gonna sell it down if you're a people

1063
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:29,470
leader think about that your peers you

1064
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:31,720
need to get that buzz going so people

1065
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,370
get excited you might have a lot of

1066
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:35,170
talent in-house people from other

1067
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:37,390
departments that might be interested in

1068
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:39,070
helping out with this and there's

1069
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,450
nothing better than growing people in my

1070
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:43,750
opinion ok identify who's with you who's

1071
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:46,210
not those who are not with you might be

1072
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,950
your biggest obstacles to consider that

1073
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,600
at the end of the day you want to get

1074
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,370
buying for this little thread hunting

1075
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:53,160
project so people can see the value

1076
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,240
that's gonna help you accelerate

1077
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,610
adoption remember it's gonna take time

1078
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:59,530
so the more work you can do up front

1079
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:03,250
the better so remember that we're

1080
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:05,290
looking to form a team we don't want the

1081
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:08,950
sole guy in the basement who's gonna do

1082
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:09,610
all this stuff

1083
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:13,300
look I said identify talent who from a

1084
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,300
security or some other departments might

1085
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,640
be able to help think about developing

1086
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,040
your people it's really expensive if you

1087
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,480
want to hire an experienced the threat

1088
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,750
hunter and they usually want to work for

1089
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,390
bigger environments where they can you

1090
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:31,810
know contribute to mature operations so

1091
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:34,090
developing cross-training that's gonna

1092
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:35,920
be a big big thing if you're a smaller

1093
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,770
shop think about that you want to fill

1094
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:40,390
those knowledge gaps you want to grow

1095
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:42,670
your people and last but not least

1096
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,070
remember all of those superheroes

1097
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:46,870
they're in the picture they have some

1098
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:50,700
flaws what buddy if I'm fine all of them

1099
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,890
coming at me down the street oh my I'm

1100
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:56,890
in trouble because the sum of its parts

1101
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:59,020
you just cannot defeat that that's why

1102
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,940
having a threat hunting team is gonna be

1103
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,830
so important you're gonna have select

1104
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:05,170
people that have expertise in different

1105
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:07,270
things and when you just combine them

1106
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:08,980
together it's just gonna be a fantastic

1107
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:12,640
and beautiful thing hit the ground

1108
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,810
running and what I mean by this is do

1109
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:19,420
something remember that we said the

1110
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,540
timing might not be right so maybe what

1111
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,980
you want to do is start writing down

1112
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:27,250
some ideas put put out your notebook if

1113
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,830
you're old school if you have OneNote

1114
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:32,350
Evernote whatever you use start writing

1115
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,760
some things down so you can start

1116
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,170
thinking about how you're going to

1117
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:39,040
attack this problem start doing

1118
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,690
something small it doesn't matter how

1119
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:41,680
small it is

1120
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,690
maybe tackle the low-hanging fruit

1121
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:46,420
involve your team gather their input

1122
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,390
don't think because you're bringing this

1123
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:52,840
idea has to be yours other people may

1124
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,850
understand something about this so make

1125
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:56,020
sure you gathering their input

1126
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:59,860
inclusivity and all all of that document

1127
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,390
some of the stuff because you don't want

1128
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:02,920
to make you're gonna make some mistakes

1129
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,150
in the past you want to make sure you

1130
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:05,740
don't make them again there's gonna be

1131
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,970
some lessons learned you want to make

1132
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:09,040
sure you have that accessible from there

1133
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,700
you define how you move forward picture

1134
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,820
here kind of summarizes my thought think

1135
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,410
big because this could be a fantastic

1136
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:20,950
thing start small but most of all just

1137
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:23,680
start do something because otherwise you

1138
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,630
will never get off the ground all right

1139
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:29,650
Chris is looking at me weird so I'm

1140
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:32,020
gonna speed it up so let's recap here

1141
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,790
quickly what is it that we talked about

1142
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:36,170
so we can get into some Q&A

1143
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:38,279
instant response and forensics are

1144
00:48:38,279 --> 00:48:40,709
reactive they sure they work but you

1145
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,930
know too late we need some new approach

1146
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:45,059
threat hunting is going to help us

1147
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:47,219
bridge the gap in becoming a more

1148
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:50,249
proactive defensive operation we need to

1149
00:48:50,249 --> 00:48:52,349
leverage people process and technology

1150
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:55,709
that tripod is important remember that

1151
00:48:55,709 --> 00:48:58,380
we cannot fully automate ok it's gonna

1152
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,660
have a place but it's not fully

1153
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,150
automated those tools to visualize

1154
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:06,599
things and find outliers anomalies and

1155
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:09,859
things like that will be invaluable ok

1156
00:49:09,859 --> 00:49:13,920
have a vision socialize that vision help

1157
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,609
people understand your vision and don't

1158
00:49:17,609 --> 00:49:19,680
forget about the team that should be

1159
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,009
with capital T EAM ok and again start

1160
00:49:23,009 --> 00:49:26,339
small but start the idea is flippin that

1161
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:29,729
massive switch from the reactive side to

1162
00:49:29,729 --> 00:49:33,150
the proactive side so with that I will

1163
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:34,469
take any questions that you guys may

1164
00:49:34,469 --> 00:49:37,640
have thank you very much

1165
