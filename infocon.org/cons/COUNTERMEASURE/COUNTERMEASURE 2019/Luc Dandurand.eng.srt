2
00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:08,189
well good morning everyone

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,059
click background I'm Canadian I'm

4
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:13,740
Montreal so that explains the accent and

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,020
I've been work I worked in the past in

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,670
the city for a few years so it's good to

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,130
be back but I've spent the last 11 years

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,380
in Europe and the last two of these have

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,570
been at guard time and guard times a

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,359
company that's doing blockchain I'll put

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,580
it in quotes because it's not your

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,219
typical Bitcoin stuff it's a different

13
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,460
approach using similar technologies to

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,219
do data and process integrity and a few

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,530
years ago they decided to start up a new

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,629
business line on cyber ranges and cyber

17
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:45,270
exercises and I was hired to lead that

18
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,640
part so I won't talk about blockchain

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,410
stuff if you're interested in that let

20
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,670
me know I'm gonna talk to you about

21
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,399
cyber exercises and specifically about

22
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,260
improving preparedness and I think a lot

23
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,320
of people think about exercises a lot as

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,870
training individual training I'll show

25
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,940
you some example of where this comes a

26
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,188
little bit to be a much wider scope and

27
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:06,600
much more interesting and much more

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,909
important and you know I'm preaching to

29
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,770
the choir here so I don't need to go

30
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,350
into any details why this is important

31
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,630
it's not a matter of if you will get

32
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,430
hacked it's when you will get hacked and

33
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,710
the big thing will be how you react and

34
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,729
how you react is not an individual

35
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:25,920
heroic moment it's a team it's a

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,320
department it's a group of people that

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,240
will work together in handling this

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,310
situation and that's a lot of team work

39
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,900
that's a lot of team work under pressure

40
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,659
for things you didn't think about a lot

41
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,640
of people stressed and asking hard

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,460
questions and until you've lived it you

43
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,450
don't really know how well you'll do so

44
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,340
we've been establishing this program of

45
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,470
cyber exercises to improve preparedness

46
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,540
to be ready when the moment comes when

47
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,460
you have a major breach and then you

48
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,079
have to do the investigation and handle

49
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,079
all all the different aspects that comes

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,960
with a large security compromise at your

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,329
organization and I'll explain to you a

52
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,179
little bit of how this is going for us

53
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:11,849
so you had a big party last night so I

54
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,890
thought that I would keep this light

55
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,320
it's a simple talk none of this

56
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,180
technical Bulli is gonna come up on

57
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,080
the screen all right

58
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,210
I broke it down in three parts theory

59
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,790
practice and then take away so I'll do

60
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,560
we'll do the dry stuff first and then

61
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,000
you can see the fun stuff after I said

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,860
this already exercises can be very very

63
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,550
different

64
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,870
this picture shows you a bunch of

65
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,700
different exercises from across the

66
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,740
world people do them for different

67
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,140
reasons and when you mention an exercise

68
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,550
everybody's got like some kind of

69
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,590
preconceived idea but it's pretty broad

70
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,930
set of different kinds of activities and

71
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,800
the details do matter so I want to walk

72
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,900
you through what we do and what we do

73
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,120
our custom cyber exercises so they're

74
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,850
really built to meet specific needs of

75
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,250
the client and this is the life cycle so

76
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,080
when we start we call this the

77
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,750
initiation phase when a client says we'd

78
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,370
like to get an exercise and then we

79
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,750
start talking about what kind of

80
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,060
exercise what are the dates set of

81
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,010
budgets and some time frame and then

82
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,630
once that's agreed and we get a contract

83
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,640
we start defining the exercise and

84
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,340
that's a long can be a long process if

85
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,870
they don't know what they want and I'll

86
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,940
go through with the kind of information

87
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,070
we decide about when we're trying to

88
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,720
define the exercise and once that's kind

89
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,400
of agreed we start the development phase

90
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,989
and then we start to build all of the

91
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,540
custom elements of the exercise to make

92
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,790
sure that that we meet the client's

93
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,860
needs and then we start the execution

94
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,620
phase and for our exercises that are

95
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,989
quite realistic usually on cyber ranges

96
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:42,540
and then there's a long phase of testing

97
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,610
deployment making sure everything works

98
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,980
and then there's a phase of seeding that

99
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,959
starts where the simulation starts it

100
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,280
will run for a few days a few weeks

101
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,500
beforehand and then the exercise

102
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,209
participants arrive on-site and then

103
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:56,100
they start the exercise and then they

104
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,190
play it out and most people forget to do

105
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,590
phase four the analysis which is really

106
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,110
important you've got to keep enough

107
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,709
effort left and in the budget you gotta

108
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:09,630
leave enough time to analyze what

109
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,130
happened during the exercise how well

110
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,810
did we do on this how well did we do on

111
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,530
that and then come up with improvements

112
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,540
some of the key aspects so the purpose

113
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,180
of an exercise and we put that in five

114
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,010
categories you can have an exercise to

115
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,200
demonstrate something to two you know

116
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,720
executives or people stay

117
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,010
holder's you can have an exercise to

118
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,810
practice skills that you already know

119
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,000
you can have an exercise to train that

120
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,340
is to learn new skills and you can

121
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,940
assess the B people against certain

122
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,850
criteria and you can certify an issue

123
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,230
certifications you know being qualified

124
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,450
for something some exercise combined a

125
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,430
bit in both you know you always usually

126
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,710
learn something new when you practice

127
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,600
something and you often practice what

128
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,010
you learn in a training exercise so it's

129
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,990
a little bit of a mix it's important for

130
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,520
you to know exactly what's the purpose

131
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,370
and then you have objectives usually we

132
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,110
have four or five high level ones and

133
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,580
then as we start to do the definition

134
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,620
will go down in depth and these can be

135
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,470
okay practice incident handling

136
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,480
communications to management malware

137
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,610
reverse engineering and then as we get

138
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,310
down in the details to the development

139
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,780
process we might say on this set of

140
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,270
tools for this kind of malware for

141
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,970
example I think so they get a little bit

142
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,280
more detail at a later stage and then we

143
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,930
have the participants who is going to

144
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,570
play in the exercise and then usually

145
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,540
have a set of people that you want to

146
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,120
train or practice exercise or assess and

147
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,740
then you have the scenario that will

148
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,000
come and then you're going to decide

149
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,530
whether you include additional people

150
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,180
because they would be involved if these

151
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,280
situations happen or if you're going to

152
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,680
role play them doing the exercise and

153
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,660
when you roleplay you can do it with

154
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,460
exercise controllers or you can do it

155
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,750
with the real people that have those

156
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,150
jobs they're aware of this scenario they

157
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,590
know what's gonna happen but they still

158
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,270
play their part and they challenge you

159
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,770
know that with the participants the

160
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,350
players in doing their thing so you have

161
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,360
to decide who's going to be in the game

162
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,479
and receiving the exercise and who's

163
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,660
going to be involved as a role player

164
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,490
you also got to look at the scope so

165
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,050
what kind of systems what are the

166
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,520
entities that are going to be involved

167
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,830
what organizations are there and we when

168
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,750
you start to make a bigger bigger cyber

169
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,580
crisis then there's more and more people

170
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,740
involved law enforcement government

171
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,660
departments other industry partners

172
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,850
where do you stop so when we get into

173
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,410
the development phase we actually

174
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,510
control this cope and we scope in scope

175
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,820
out review the objectives and adjust

176
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,310
everything as we go along and then you

177
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,560
come up with a scenario so our exercises

178
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,630
aren't technical training there's a

179
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,599
story always a story behind a situation

180
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,849
that comes up so there's a background

181
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:43,619
and we could use real or fictitious

182
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:45,659
entities so we could use the world as it

183
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:47,879
is but maybe you don't want to say this

184
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,699
nation-state attacked us politically

185
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:51,929
that could be sensitive so then you

186
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:53,999
create a fake nation you put it in the

187
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:55,979
middle of the Atlantic Ocean and then

188
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,779
you give it a name and people and then

189
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:59,699
you start playing with that and there's

190
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,770
your threat actors who are going to do

191
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,659
the attacks and this is really important

192
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:05,009
for us because this is the whole

193
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:06,929
coherence of the storyline of the

194
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:09,119
scenario that really needs to make sense

195
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:11,249
so it's easy to say let's train on

196
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:13,770
malware and then this kind of malware

197
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,959
but then you need a story how did this

198
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:19,199
malware get there and why and often we

199
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,909
begin developing and people have ideas

200
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:22,319
we could do this we could do that we

201
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,909
could do that and all of this is

202
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:25,649
beautiful but then we take a step back

203
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:28,169
and we ask ourselves why would the

204
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:30,330
threat actor do that that doesn't make

205
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,189
sense at the technical level or in the

206
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:34,709
operational level so then we revalidate

207
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:36,240
and say ok we can't do it there because

208
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,529
they would never do this if they're a

209
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:40,499
nation-state with you know desire to do

210
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:41,969
an intelligence activity then they're

211
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:44,610
not going to break the system or cause

212
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,409
something that will get them noticed or

213
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:48,869
if they're there to do damage doing this

214
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:51,059
they won't do that so we have to create

215
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:53,129
coherence here the threat actor level

216
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:55,409
and then we have this road to crisis so

217
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,930
a bunch of elements that will lead up

218
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,469
the tensions and explain the situation

219
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:02,759
at the moment of the start of the

220
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,159
exercise and during the exercise we

221
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:07,110
define what are called story lines these

222
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,360
are sequences of event and we'll either

223
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,339
aim to achieve one of the objectives or

224
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:13,110
focused on one aspect of the exercise

225
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,360
and we appoint people to take care of

226
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,919
these events and make sure that they're

227
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,569
thought through when will everything

228
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:22,949
happen and then we have model modalities

229
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:24,869
of the exercise and this is where you

230
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:27,089
know the world of exercises comes in and

231
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,099
blows up into so many options you can do

232
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:31,139
so you can have in terms of the exercise

233
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,240
environment real systems the computer

234
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,698
system that you're using now rarely done

235
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:37,289
because these are production grade

236
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,419
system you could break them so you have

237
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,279
to be careful you could have a simulated

238
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,169
system so you replicate the real world

239
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,720
on a cyber range this is what we do most

240
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,120
often very difficult to make the real

241
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,309
world the replica of it so you always

242
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:52,889
you know have some part of it that's

243
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:54,420
implemented and other things are not

244
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,140
there you can have it as a table

245
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,750
top simply talking about things having

246
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,340
seniors are on the table for example and

247
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,750
saying this is the email you receive

248
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,760
what do you do or you can combine all

249
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,190
these things and have elements of all of

250
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,440
those you have the degree of involvement

251
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,720
you can be anything from a kind of

252
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,550
interactive briefing where you're asking

253
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,500
the people to say what would you do now

254
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,570
okay if that's your decision and this is

255
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,890
what would happen next what do you do

256
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,260
now all the way to having the people

257
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,180
sitting down and doing the hands-on work

258
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:28,060
yes let's do them during but let's keep

259
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:35,530
them very fast so a tabletop is a is

260
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,320
that there's no computer systems so

261
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,820
basically you print material and you

262
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,160
just hand over this has happened this

263
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,440
you know so it's basically just around a

264
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,790
table without any computer systems good

265
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,370
so far okay so yeah you can be all hands

266
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,320
on playing their roles so that would be

267
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,030
really extreme degree of involvement

268
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,330
which is the one that we prefer you can

269
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,280
have an exercise that is held in one

270
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,720
place all the participants have to come

271
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,100
there or you could distribute it over

272
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,730
multiple sites you can have scenario

273
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,890
events that are pre-recorded so you can

274
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,540
actually play them in the system's when

275
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,770
they're happening or you could actually

276
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,960
do them live which is what we prefer and

277
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,360
actually this is also where so far for

278
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,580
our exercises we've hired Michael Kent

279
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,560
and Mike to be our red team and they've

280
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,300
done all the attacks live because when

281
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,010
they're on sites and the participants

282
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,040
are reacting in a different way we can

283
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,080
put more pressure but less pressure we

284
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,490
can adjust to the reaction of the

285
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:34,060
participants makes a better exercise and

286
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,410
then you have the tools techniques and

287
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,450
procedures and this gets complicated and

288
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,790
this I'm talking about the usually let's

289
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,500
say a blue team exercise meaning a

290
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,450
defensive exercise what tools are they

291
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,690
going to use and they're it's best to

292
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,700
use the tools that they're using on a

293
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,560
daily basis but this could be licensed

294
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,590
software this could be something if you

295
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,970
have a crowd coming from a different

296
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,650
organization could be very different so

297
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,270
then you have to pick a middle ground

298
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,310
some kind of software put it in place

299
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,500
and then they were going to practice

300
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,440
when we talk about communications I used

301
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,600
to do exercises in NATO

302
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,910
they always wanted to test the actual

303
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,920
Communications because they was find out

304
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,510
that their phone number lists are out of

305
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,130
dates so in the exercise they need to

306
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,930
call this person they bring the number

307
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,420
no one picks up phone number is dead so

308
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,370
if we gave them fake phones which we do

309
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,170
in some exercises they weren't have

310
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,700
validated that they're real means of

311
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,710
communications function so you have to

312
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,450
decide which way it's going to go and

313
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,510
what you're going to do we have also the

314
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,310
possibility to introduce new tools that

315
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,560
don't exist that they don't have now and

316
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,480
we do it to demonstrate how those tools

317
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,850
would help them do some of the work

318
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,160
they're typically asked to do and these

319
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,410
convenience TTP's there are tools that

320
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,630
there's a common denominator like

321
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,000
open-source software which we use a lot

322
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,530
because all of our participants have

323
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,150
different things anyway so let's just

324
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,280
use what's commonly available and put

325
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,130
that there and that speaks to the

326
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,960
communications whether it's real or

327
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,760
simulated so we've done exercises where

328
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,870
we've provided them provided them I

329
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,300
press the wrong button there we go

330
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,130
provided them with mobile phones they've

331
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,280
been able to make phone calls on this

332
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,490
and in some cases it was all simulated

333
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,440
aspects all right so those are the

334
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,100
modalities

335
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,180
so it depends it varies that's client a

336
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,890
that's the discussion in the definition

337
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,570
and we take it over as well in the

338
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,490
development when we develop we we do the

339
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,140
spiral process we might revisit so in

340
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,780
some cases we've done very full-featured

341
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,390
exercises most of them are safe

342
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,540
full-featured is never full full but we

343
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,490
do look at what we're scheduling so we

344
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,710
take every individual we have we get

345
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,300
them to answer survey we know their

346
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,250
skill sets we match them in teams that

347
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,260
balance the skill set and then we look

348
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,360
at the exercise objectives and then we

349
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,400
are going to lay essentially tasks we

350
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,930
call them injects this is what we're

351
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,430
feeding them they're gonna work on this

352
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,110
we estimate it'll take them two hours

353
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,250
and this is what they're gonna give it

354
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,410
back to us and then we're gonna schedule

355
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,270
their time and be very careful about not

356
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,220
overloading them but whether they do

357
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,840
this type of work or that that type of

358
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,520
work that's all part of the design and

359
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,470
it depends what the client wants most

360
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,970
often we've looked at many of the

361
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,530
aspects of reporting and they've been

362
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,090
they have to do many things at the same

363
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,280
time some people looking at one attack

364
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,360
you're they're looking at the different

365
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,430
attack another one preparing a briefing

366
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,000
for management but focus is important I

367
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,520
have it on a slide that's all the art of

368
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,710
designing the exercise because of course

369
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,030
if you create a situation where

370
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,650
everybody is super busy on everything

371
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,060
and they lose you know they don't know

372
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,960
what's going on anymore

373
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,430
they lose the value

374
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,910
super hard to go through systems and but

375
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:36,510
you also talked about interactions

376
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,310
we all do Calvin

377
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,200
so you mean that the attacks would come

378
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,460
from the internet or that we would take

379
00:14:52,460 --> 00:15:02,420
the exercise well we haven't done

380
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,130
operations in Canada yet we've done

381
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,470
operations in Estonia and Switzerland

382
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,390
we're going to the UK very soon we could

383
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,580
go anywhere we travel anywhere to bring

384
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,510
the exercise yeah okay so this I spoke

385
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,830
about this spiral development there's

386
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,480
many aspects of an exercise you've got

387
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,070
this purpose the objectives the

388
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,680
participants the scope the scenario the

389
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,510
modalities in the environment we go to

390
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,220
the client we say this is what you can

391
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,530
do and things start to shape up and we

392
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,770
appoint a core planning team with

393
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,410
stakeholders from the client and they're

394
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,820
gone oh I'd like to do it's like to do

395
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,370
that and we think about it we go and do

396
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,930
some work come back with them with a

397
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,670
scenario and say ok this could be the

398
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,200
attacker here's your threat actor this

399
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,670
is what it would be intent on doing any

400
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,200
comeback or no that's politically not

401
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,690
good okay so we tweak that and then we

402
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,340
say well if we include this then we need

403
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,690
this equipment can you supply the

404
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,850
equipment no ok well let's move on to

405
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,800
something else and we play with that to

406
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,800
do all of these these these aspects and

407
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,090
finalize what it is and that's the

408
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,210
development portion and after a while

409
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,400
you you add you know an exercise is kind

410
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,480
of like a brick wall and the high

411
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,120
weights coming at you and the good thing

412
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,950
and the bad thing about it is that well

413
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,090
the bad thing is that you've got this

414
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,010
deadline people are gonna show up and

415
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,270
you're gonna have to deliver and if

416
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,410
you're not ready you're in big trouble

417
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,540
and the good thing is it's got a

418
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,820
deadline and when it happens it will be

419
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,890
over so it's not this project that will

420
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,300
last forever in your life

421
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,940
you get it done with but you have to

422
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,770
know how to schedule thing that's really

423
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,090
important because there's a lot of

424
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,650
different aspects and you gotta bring in

425
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,980
bazillion things into a cohesive thing

426
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,160
experience that gets delivered so we we

427
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,920
use some automation software and we're

428
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,840
building this essentially this is also

429
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,900
the product that we want to sell this is

430
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,510
a tool that allows us to drag and drop

431
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,370
all of the virtual machines and the

432
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,230
assets that we have and plan the

433
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,510
scenario out and then click on a button

434
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,190
and deploy it on a cyber range and

435
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,140
everything gets built automatically this

436
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,210
is something that's in the works and

437
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,650
we've been building over the years that

438
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,080
we continue to build and that

439
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,730
really helps us to speed up the

440
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,530
development process and the automation

441
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:10,420
for creating very complex exercises so a

442
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,490
couple of consideration you got to

443
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,020
understand the complexity of what you're

444
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,430
doing and you got to control it

445
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,589
according to this schedule and then you

446
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:18,910
got to know at what point you're

447
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,829
starting to be late and then get back to

448
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,599
the client so you need to decide on this

449
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,310
scenario I need your thread actor I need

450
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,810
to know if this is in if this is out I

451
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,490
need a participant list and all of these

452
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,350
things so that you're sure that you

453
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,350
don't actually arrive at the moment of

454
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,850
the exercise completely not ready or

455
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,780
some things not not well thought true

456
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,090
now that's an art and we've arrived that

457
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,860
exercises with a lot of things that were

458
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,590
not well thought true but we managed yes

459
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:52,300
I can I think again I can oh yeah

460
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:58,150
pictures are good yeah but not

461
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,940
everything in the slides yeah the slides

462
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,130
will be those videos I can't give the

463
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,880
videos out all right so all of this

464
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,770
complexity you have to understand it

465
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,600
control it you have to know you know

466
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,640
your pace and development if you go too

467
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,590
quickly and you develop something and

468
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,960
you start to build it and then later on

469
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,850
the client comes back and says yeah we

470
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,130
can't do that you've wasted your time

471
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,960
now you're closer to execution you've

472
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,520
spent a lot of effort now you have less

473
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,740
time to react so you know getting the

474
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,480
feeling from the client is he really

475
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,070
know what he wants or not and is he

476
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,020
gonna change his mind and all of this is

477
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,470
really enough

478
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:54,930
would you say key takeaway points for us

479
00:18:54,930 --> 00:19:01,930
and say we should have this we need this

480
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:06,090
they're dealing with budget constraints

481
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,360
it's preparedness is the key thing

482
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,850
resilient you're gonna get hacked ok

483
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,190
maybe not but you can't say that it will

484
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,990
never we invest in protection and we'll

485
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,669
be protected you need to invest in

486
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,799
defense and that protection will give

487
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,390
you those barrier defenses once those

488
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,820
are breached you react and you invest in

489
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,529
the defence detection reaction and all

490
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:38,120
that you've got incident handling tool

491
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,250
but you know if it works you don't know

492
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,260
if it works unless you've got a big

493
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,730
incident and you've went through it then

494
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,769
you know it that it works if you haven't

495
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,090
had an incident and you think you might

496
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,149
get one then practice how big the

497
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:53,029
exercise is well consult you ask and you

498
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:54,919
say well you know we have this budget

499
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:57,500
what can we get and then you can then

500
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,389
see if that's okay and move forward

501
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:01,519
there's individual training but once

502
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:03,409
you've got individuals trained they need

503
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:05,059
to work as a team and then you need to

504
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:07,639
engage the senior executives into a

505
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,309
crisis and all that is best done and

506
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,840
they're an exercise the word there's a

507
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,220
common scenario you've thought through

508
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,529
where you are in your organization what

509
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:17,059
lessons do you need what things do you

510
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:19,279
need to validate so it's about

511
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,750
preparedness being prepared due

512
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,750
diligence and how much to put well you

513
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,039
know we don't have an answer for that

514
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,720
there's cheap exercise there's expensive

515
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,909
exercises one of the things you have to

516
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:30,260
remember though if you're gonna like

517
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,389
schedule an exercise six months from now

518
00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:34,610
and then you plan for it and then you

519
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,559
run it and then you analyze the results

520
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,940
that's gonna be what you're gonna do for

521
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,139
the next nine months in terms of

522
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:41,210
exercising in your organization and the

523
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,970
world moves on if that exercise is small

524
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,950
and it's meaningless

525
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,250
you might have spent only so much money

526
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,620
but you've wasted that time now you're

527
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,330
gonna say I need next exercise which is

528
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,250
nine months later until you that you

529
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,960
learn those lessons so you're like a

530
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,480
year and a half later so the budget has

531
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,429
to be thought about not just how much

532
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:03,440
this cost but the fact that this is what

533
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,789
you're investing for the next nine

534
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:06,880
months and nothing else in terms of

535
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,220
practicing

536
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,500
so I realize you two have problem

537
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,030
variation second what would it be

538
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,230
possible if we say what

539
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:30,740
talking about price this is so complex

540
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,360
depending on you know how you bring it

541
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,640
together ask me after and I'll give you

542
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,440
some information on the past but you

543
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,090
should see the next slide to understand

544
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,160
what we're talking about okay I want to

545
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,940
yeah

546
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,799
[Music]

547
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,150
this ability to just I mean you might

548
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,920
schedule this and you might not realize

549
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,360
that the people that are coming of this

550
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,950
level of you might have not have a

551
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,690
mismatch with a skill set and when

552
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,880
you're doing it live you can adjust we

553
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,680
have to we have like sent people into

554
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,480
the room saying okay you guys are not

555
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,980
getting this here's how it works and

556
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,480
then we've walked them through this what

557
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,250
you need to look at and then you're

558
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,510
really adapting the training

559
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,370
specifically to the needs the other

560
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,750
thing that's really important is that

561
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,820
you're having a social event we have an

562
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,710
icebreaker we have an evening out we

563
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,120
have people that are coming from

564
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,710
different parts of different

565
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,630
organizations meeting each other for the

566
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,460
first time having to work on the

567
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,410
pressure as a team and then they call

568
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,150
each other out so we've done this like

569
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,670
sector-wide kind of exercises and people

570
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,290
come back and say you know I know my

571
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,600
professional network has really

572
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,970
increased a lot and and this is a true

573
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,280
benefit for many organization regarding

574
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,380
cost I'll tell you that I think we did a

575
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,060
bit of math on this and it's not more

576
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,650
expensive than a science course per

577
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,590
person okay so but it has a different

578
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,260
value that's for sure I'll go quickly

579
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,820
now because I don't want to run out of

580
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,830
time for the for the videos that's the

581
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:54,370
fun part so focus the exercise so you

582
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,900
can get carried away with many things

583
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,090
happening you got to establish certain

584
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,529
focal points you gotta schedule them in

585
00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:01,000
time and you got to say that at this

586
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,590
moment this is what they'll work on and

587
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,090
then at this moment that's what they

588
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,970
will will work on I don't know why the

589
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,870
laptop goes to yeah sleep or something

590
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,700
you need to plan everything you need to

591
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,169
schedule your development you need to

592
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:15,909
know where you are in the planning cycle

593
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:17,710
and how much time you've got left and

594
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,659
you need to work and inform the

595
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:21,159
stakeholders you need to tell them what

596
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,750
you're gonna do because at some point

597
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,850
they might actually say no you can't do

598
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,440
that or that's not realistic and if they

599
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,010
tell you too late and you're out of time

600
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,120
and then we have this concept of

601
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,279
exercise controllers these people that

602
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,649
will actually help you deliver the

603
00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:37,360
exercise and you gotta get those guys to

604
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,070
be close to the participants to

605
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,020
understand what does the person do on a

606
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,970
daily basis that you're training what

607
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,559
are the toolset what are the practices

608
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,929
what is the regulatory framework are

609
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:48,700
there any reporting requirements and

610
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,220
then you got to get that into the

611
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:56,890
scenario so that it's realistic when

612
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,450
you're building storylines we've all

613
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,490
I've done an exercise where people

614
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,200
started crying because everything fell

615
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,690
apart we made something that was

616
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,250
dependent on something else that was

617
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,570
dependent on something else and when

618
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,070
that thing didn't happen and everything

619
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,140
just didn't happen and you've worked for

620
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,940
months and you just can't deliver your

621
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,350
thing everybody's disappointed

622
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,200
so understanding dependencies of events

623
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,840
and this was an exercise in NATO where

624
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,419
we actually did massive cyber range

625
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:25,690
activity at the same time as the crisis

626
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,480
management exercise was happening which

627
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,700
is the where the North Atlantic Council

628
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,070
meets so this is you know minister level

629
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,080
and they're trying to handle the crisis

630
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,370
and we're feeding them the cyber

631
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,730
elements and synchronizing the top level

632
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,950
executive that minister level and the

633
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,140
techy guys doing you know packet capture

634
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,299
into something that works in a two day

635
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:48,760
time frame was a significant challenge

636
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,520
it was very difficult but it has to be

637
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,500
done so but these are dependencies that

638
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,289
can cause your exercise to fail you

639
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:57,730
gotta have a backup of things that

640
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,279
you're depending upon don't happen we

641
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:02,289
found it very useful to invest in the

642
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:04,779
scenario a lot of exercise or technical

643
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:06,669
dude is then do that we build a story

644
00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:09,190
it's a Hollywood movie and you're in it

645
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,929
you're the star and that really has

646
00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:11,890
worked because it

647
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,890
very boring to do pcap and reverse

648
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,290
engineering all day until there is like

649
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,540
the news story that comes up and I could

650
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,430
oh that's my organization being hacked

651
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,380
in the news do you just get a completely

652
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,630
different feeling you get into it and

653
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,900
then it really becomes interesting and

654
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,730
then a realistic event I talked about

655
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,470
the thread actor needing to be coherent

656
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,150
that needs to be at the operational

657
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,920
level why would they do that if that's

658
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,950
what their mission is and what tools and

659
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,470
techniques do they use and it needs to

660
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,300
be customized and it needs to target

661
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,100
specifically the skill sets and roles of

662
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,520
every participants when you're running

663
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,710
it you need to monitor closely I've been

664
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,960
at an exercise organized by somebody

665
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,070
else for a central bank few years ago

666
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,960
and at some point we're expecting

667
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,270
somebody to do something that person

668
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,220
didn't believe in a scenario so he said

669
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,870
I'm not doing it he was pretty senior

670
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,430
and they kind I said well let's wait and

671
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,470
see and I was a big mistake because the

672
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,240
longer they waited the less he wanted to

673
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,860
do it the more the dependent things

674
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,080
weren't gonna happen and then the whole

675
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,060
part just fell fell out of the exercise

676
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,800
and that was significant so if

677
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,270
something's not happening you got to

678
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,100
step in and correct it and we have all

679
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,440
sorts of tools and techniques to bring

680
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,750
the participants back on track and the

681
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,280
thing with an exercise is not like a

682
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,200
training a training you've got you're

683
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,520
the master of the classroom you're

684
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,050
feeding them this you say do this then

685
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,760
do that then do this you're in control

686
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,890
you're nothing to control of an exercise

687
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,450
the participants they were gonna do

688
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,280
whatever they want and they're gonna

689
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,230
surprise you and you got to be ready if

690
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,210
they are going to go do that you didn't

691
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:46,090
expect it to find some artifice an

692
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,650
official thing to bring them back on

693
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:51,490
track in a reasonable way and if you're

694
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,320
dealing with senior executives they're

695
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,910
not trained in the same way as a

696
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,130
technical person you have to be careful

697
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,830
with them and their busy schedules when

698
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,640
they walk in

699
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,230
it's got to be ready it's got to go it's

700
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,460
got to be meaningful it's got to be at

701
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,010
their level and after you've done this

702
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,930
well we do hot wash and you talked about

703
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,660
you know whether we run this in one one

704
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,370
stretch or not we've done exercises

705
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,470
where it continues until the end and

706
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,630
then at the end we have a debrief we've

707
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,400
done exercises more recently with Mike

708
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,840
where Mike comes in at the end of the

709
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,430
day and says okay today this is what we

710
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,050
did to you and this is what you should

711
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,460
have seen this is where you need to be

712
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,040
and

713
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,630
the next day we continue from that point

714
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,060
on you decide you know as you create the

715
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,740
exercise which design approach you will

716
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,900
take but we do this hot watch either

717
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,390
daily or immediately after the last day

718
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,850
and then we do a debrief you know on the

719
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,860
last day where we explain exactly here's

720
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,690
the thread actor this is what they did

721
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,040
this is where you could have seen them

722
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,360
this is where you didn't see them and

723
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,450
that's what you could have picked up and

724
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,940
we provide a full scenario and then you

725
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,980
make a report and you talk about how

726
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,930
well this did the planning of this

727
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:57,080
exercise do and go and how can we

728
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,150
improve future exercises and then you

729
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,740
make a separate report about how they

730
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,180
performed and how could they improve

731
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:06,830
their performance operationally any

732
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,450
questions on the theory because we're

733
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:12,100
gonna get into the practical part yes

734
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:24,440
what will be the most thing that you

735
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,780
should focus on to keep people engaged

736
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:35,450
so so two things I would weld is if I'm

737
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,730
gonna say one thing it's reality and and

738
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,830
that it's meaningful to their role so

739
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,300
you need to understand who that person

740
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,640
is and what do they do on a daily basis

741
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,130
and deliver an experience close to home

742
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,530
for them something that's meaningful if

743
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,170
the exercise is bringing a diverse set

744
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,750
of people then it's technical and

745
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,870
operational reality and some challenging

746
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,020
things you know no boring moments

747
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,550
diversity this will get them engaged

748
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,160
okay I'm gonna talk to you about these

749
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,710
exercises that we did so we got some

750
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,330
contracts through the Ministry of

751
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:15,170
Defence of Estonia for the UK first the

752
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,880
civil nuclear sector we did get

753
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,470
delivered them a custom exercise in

754
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:22,220
February 2018 then we did a gas exercise

755
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,680
and then we did the same exercise again

756
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,520
for a different crowd of people so this

757
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,980
is all custom-made the first time they

758
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,060
came they didn't know what they wanted

759
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,770
so they said well we'll take whatever

760
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,480
you've got and then we said well that

761
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,950
doesn't work this way so we created

762
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,280
something custom a gauge

763
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,350
but we really didn't have a lot of time

764
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,900
we had three months to to get this done

765
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,020
so it was pretty hard to do it but it

766
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,960
worked out very well I'll combine both

767
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,210
exercise together so overall we had like

768
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,430
18 participants on average from 12

769
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,140
different organization from the civil

770
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,480
nuclear sector in the UK they all flew

771
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,400
in to Estonia with many many observers

772
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,530
they were like 30 people in our offices

773
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,020
and then we build this exercise

774
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,180
environment and we simulated the nuclear

775
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,420
power plant and that simulation you know

776
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,190
I talk about we as embed it only takes a

777
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,410
little bit of it to make it good enough

778
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,480
for the exercise because of course we're

779
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,180
not going to make a nuclear power plant

780
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,160
our nuclear power plant operated with 20

781
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,710
users for example but having 20

782
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,450
workstations for the red team to attack

783
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,450
and these guys to defend is a whole lot

784
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,700
they can't even get enough visibility in

785
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,320
the speed of the exercise and they get

786
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,790
enough training with this you don't have

787
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,040
to go bigger than that so it was very

788
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,610
much fake we did hire company to consult

789
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,970
so the domain knowledge we don't have we

790
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,460
master orchestrating the exercise and

791
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,530
then the client comes and whatever the

792
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,780
domain is we contract out bring in an

793
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,730
expert and then we talk about how does

794
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,470
it work cybersecurity a nuclear power

795
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,510
plant and we said can we do this no no

796
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,800
that's how the heart works and this is

797
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,480
da da da da and then we work something

798
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,150
custom with the experts in this scenario

799
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,010
we had physical access control video

800
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:04,230
surveillance at the inside of the some

801
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:07,410
parts of the system on the outside we

802
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,470
had one simulated nuclear reactor

803
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,720
basically a little scuzzy assist SCADA

804
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,360
system that we we simulated the cooling

805
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,120
of the reactor and a you know HMI

806
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,800
display with a reactor and it's cooling

807
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,230
and we had a simulated backup generator

808
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,970
on the first case it was in Germany

809
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,310
where the VPN to Germany and that

810
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,230
actually was the generator if you know

811
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,360
about the hora web vulnerability that

812
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,060
was this released by DHS I think many

813
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,400
many years ago you basically this the

814
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,780
way the system is built if you change

815
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,240
the cycle of the generator it actually

816
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,610
kicks when when you do that and then you

817
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,140
can kick it so much that it just

818
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,840
explodes and breaks down so we exploited

819
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,730
that vulnerability through the

820
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,860
simulation and they could they could

821
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,600
actually see the way the same way that

822
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,050
the cyst

823
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:55,230
it was a copy of the code I guess and we

824
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,390
had to thread actors and one insider one

825
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,680
third actor was stealing credit card

826
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,660
information was a diversion the point

827
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,970
was can they distinguish between the

828
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,380
other one and this one the other one

829
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,910
being a nation-states who wanted to

830
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:08,010
discredit the nuclear industry by

831
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:11,100
causing the reactor to scram and

832
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,540
basically that's what they did they shut

833
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,540
the cooling pump down and they destroyed

834
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,880
the back-up generator and when they shut

835
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,440
the cooling pad pump down the safety

836
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,270
system triggered in the the reactor

837
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,610
scrammed so that was the scenario much

838
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:27,169
more to it did I miss anything

839
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,700
yeah and we bought real hardware ok

840
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,900
maybe that's not the one to use in

841
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,610
nuclear power plan but we had these card

842
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,380
swipes and then when you would swipe the

843
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,150
card would send a signal so we had the

844
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,650
card swipe and we swipe a couple of

845
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,090
times to show people moving in the rooms

846
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,740
we had a fig diagram of where the rooms

847
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,110
were and then these guys got into that

848
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,960
system and put in a new key card and

849
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,000
changed the access rules so now an

850
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,340
insider with his card could go into a

851
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,619
room he's not allowed to and in the end

852
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:20,629
this insider place this Raspberry Pi

853
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:23,360
device with a Wi-Fi antenna onto the ICS

854
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,310
system which was of course disconnected

855
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,230
and we build everything up so there were

856
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,690
attacks there was RDP servers I think I

857
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,330
have the yeah this is the crazy network

858
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:35,960
diagram so this times many times as many

859
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,060
teams as you've got and we I'm not going

860
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,399
to go through it but I have a laser so I

861
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,668
want to use it ok so there was the sock

862
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:45,730
team and office zone some servers

863
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,840
physical security with the cameras and

864
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,750
and there's own access control thing we

865
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,550
add jump servers so you'd only be able

866
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,159
to RDP here and if you are we're there

867
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,410
open a session and then go and see yeah

868
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:00,310
the real fast control system and the

869
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:03,410
PLC's to control the cooling and then

870
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:06,619
you you had other systems to simulate

871
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:09,500
the internet here pretty complex in the

872
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,390
end to put in the pour in tests yes

873
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:27,320
so so we deploy and this was a Windows

874
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,540
environment so we install a virtual

875
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,970
machines complete systems of Windows a

876
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,790
domain controller we create lists of

877
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,850
user create the users and that people

878
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,590
sing at the keyboard simulating things

879
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,390
and as well as scripts that are sending

880
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:44,060
emails and surfing so the IT environment

881
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,130
feels like a populated office

882
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:49,250
environment Windows domain for the ICS

883
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,860
actually the UK provided those Siemens

884
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,930
device that we physically connected to

885
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:56,150
the cyber range and then wrote code to

886
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,760
simulate a cooling pump very basic again

887
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,770
the reales on there is not something

888
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,750
significant it's something very small

889
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,700
very basic but that's very important to

890
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,400
do and this is what we do when we

891
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,050
develop the exercise we build all those

892
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,940
systems we run tests and when they're

893
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,620
correct we then we start the seeding we

894
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,030
start to do the attacks before the

895
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,070
exercise when they walk in the systems

896
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,510
are compromised and they already start

897
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:21,290
to work I'm just looking at time you're

898
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:24,290
asking the questions in as we go along

899
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:37,190
so I think we're okay okay yeah so that

900
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,200
was the big setup that we had it's

901
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,760
pretty complicated to build pretty

902
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,340
sophisticated stuff I just want to show

903
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,110
you how we control this in Iowa and this

904
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,630
is a I didn't have a network connection

905
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,940
here this is a presentation of the

906
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,490
events that we plan and at the time that

907
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:54,590
they're scheduled to happen and we do

908
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,270
this planning and this is just a subset

909
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,910
usually we will have like 500 hand tree

910
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,470
in this and you can like kind of scroll

911
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,270
through and see what's gonna happen and

912
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,430
we give a briefing you say okay this is

913
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,870
the plan they're gonna do this then this

914
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,400
is gonna happen and this is gonna happen

915
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,350
then this can happen and we use these

916
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,110
tool to kind of look over time okay how

917
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,820
much stuff are we throwing at these guys

918
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,220
and then individually we look and we say

919
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,050
okay what is this person receiving in

920
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,690
terms of emails injects requests for

921
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,700
works and is he going to be busy how

922
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,710
long is that gonna take and then you

923
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,240
know we just make sure that they don't

924
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,550
they're not overloaded and that's the

925
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,080
participant then we have to look at the

926
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,030
red team and the red team is to do this

927
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,480
and that and do all that and

928
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,840
they have time and in this exercise we

929
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,730
made some mistakes so this goes really

930
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:41,100
fast and things you just got a you know

931
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,260
plan and then we have videos I'll show

932
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,850
you we film them before and we have to

933
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,230
play them so in the end we actually

934
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,880
didn't think things through we filmed

935
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,350
the sequences and then we're like ready

936
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,270
to go and we start the exercise we're

937
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,980
doing the last minute thinking and we

938
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,970
say oh my god

939
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,980
we like the video there's only 20

940
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,680
seconds to do this and then you know the

941
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,420
red team's got to go in do a bunch of

942
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,340
stuff in 20 seconds and therefore it's

943
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,510
gonna take them five minutes so they

944
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,670
have to start five minutes sooner but we

945
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,140
don't know when that is and so it

946
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:27,390
becomes in order for us to have got to

947
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,520
get the physical access controls we have

948
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,290
to go through a trusted workstation that

949
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,300
connect to the firewall to the Java

950
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,910
server so in order to actually eat the

951
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,160
twenty second interval against the

952
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,530
proper triggering scheduling we have to

953
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,750
set ourselves up our proxies and three

954
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,480
directories to stuff in advance and then

955
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,670
basically sit there you know hands on

956
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,950
keyboard ready to go and do we hear from

957
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,619
Luke or what loose teams they go on the

958
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:55,020
beach if we just hope and pray that the

959
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,609
blue teams don't see our access

960
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:02,060
and you you know might being a pretty

961
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,829
relaxed guy pretty much all the time but

962
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:05,329
I've seen might looking at his keyboard

963
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:07,339
and like okay is it you know really

964
00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:10,000
being ready yeah

965
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,590
well well that's one of the key thing

966
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,030
I'm glad you asked that so so many

967
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,250
exercises are blue against red and red

968
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,960
just grooves crazy they do whatever it

969
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,730
takes and then this stuff just becomes

970
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,590
like a wacom whole kind of game and then

971
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,290
if there's scoring then people it's I

972
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,420
don't want to be offensive anything it's

973
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,220
like the Olympics you know you gotta get

974
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,870
drugged and not get caught kind of thing

975
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:56,230
to win so the point is is is that the

976
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,880
red and blue stuff they need don't

977
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,590
practice cyber defense they practice

978
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:02,140
winning that scoring algorithm so in our

979
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,910
case the red team is completely under

980
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,800
our control we were with a client before

981
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,240
I have to say what's your threat actor

982
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,850
and then we define that and as we plan

983
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,380
the exercise can see the tracked actor

984
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,880
is going to do that and they say man

985
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,100
that's not likely to happen you know too

986
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,720
sophisticated that's not what we want to

987
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,820
practice for when it practice this and

988
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,380
then we change it so it's a discussion

989
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,690
with the client the client will say this

990
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,340
is what we want and we work with them

991
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,320
because it's not easy to do at the end

992
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,610
of the day though we've all agreed that

993
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:30,160
this is the scope of capabilities that

994
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,720
they have and this is their strategic

995
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,070
intent therefore that's what they're

996
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,570
going to do and we'll work it out it's a

997
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:37,590
discussion it's custom

998
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,349
[Music]

999
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:22,480
yeah I mean we work it out

1000
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,990
yeah the objective is for them to win at

1001
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,640
least learn something and they can at

1002
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,290
some point shut them completely out and

1003
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:31,660
at some point it's not happened we've

1004
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,609
always managed to keep it in control and

1005
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:35,560
keep it along the plan we had made but

1006
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,540
if the plan goes wrong it's next sighs

1007
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,280
we walk in the room and say guys this

1008
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,170
happened this failed or you did too well

1009
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:43,540
we're gonna like reset here now we're

1010
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,849
back on track we can just do that it's

1011
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:48,940
very easy so we do news like I'm looking

1012
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,770
at this little you know yellow color

1013
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:53,530
here we do news things and the news is

1014
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,390
there to to put them in perspective so

1015
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:59,079
I'll play this and this is an example of

1016
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:02,980
a newscast we did and and this was for

1017
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,310
the nuclear exercise

1018
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:11,920
[Music]

1019
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,410
to our top story Renu cyberattacks

1020
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,789
against the skinless nuclear power plant

1021
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:23,890
locations of this is one of them really

1022
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:26,799
well Fame well-known and famous Estonian

1023
00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:28,599
actors so when people that Estonia saw

1024
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:29,950
this new they're like oh my god you

1025
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:37,119
hired they you know top actor when it

1026
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:37,989
gets to this point

1027
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,359
inspector bankers will give up dark

1028
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:43,089
escape this nuclear power plant on the

1029
00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:45,759
Lincolnshire Coast was the target of

1030
00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:49,089
cyber attacks a few months ago during

1031
00:42:49,089 --> 00:42:52,269
those attacks crippling ransomware was

1032
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,460
planted by criminals or the plants

1033
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,989
computers I'm just going to move it

1034
00:42:55,989 --> 00:42:57,730
forward so I click impatient to over

1035
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,859
here now the Nuclear Power Corporation

1036
00:42:59,859 --> 00:43:03,640
is click from the association of nuclear

1037
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,980
scientists good afternoon doctor fashion

1038
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,279
back can you please describe to us this

1039
00:43:09,279 --> 00:43:13,859
is an expertise attacks yes of course

1040
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,640
eventually these are just initial

1041
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,490
reports since pigments as more

1042
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:22,230
information becomes available from the

1043
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,880
Nuclear Power Corporation and the

1044
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,020
governments in this case the the guys

1045
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,960
they barely started and the enemy who's

1046
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,910
breaking in is the one who released the

1047
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,400
information and leaked it that's the

1048
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,900
part of the scenario because they want

1049
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,700
discredit of the nuclear industry now

1050
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,790
this is serious it means that these

1051
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:46,680
attacks are much more dangerous than the

1052
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,510
previous world's experienced at the plus

1053
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:53,670
several years ago well it's not clear

1054
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:55,650
whether the attackers can actually

1055
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:58,380
control the reactors so here's what the

1056
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,160
news do to you the guys saying that

1057
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,450
things are safe don't worry but the

1058
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:05,190
images are completely different in the

1059
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:07,200
Nuclear Power Corporation has designed

1060
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,680
these computers systems properly it

1061
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,359
shouldn't be possible for a cyberattack

1062
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:14,720
to affect the safety of any

1063
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,630
radioactivity but we don't know and we

1064
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:19,830
don't know very much about the situation

1065
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,710
at the site either so anyways this news

1066
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,330
goes on I'll skip forward because the

1067
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:28,200
other videos are a bit better so this

1068
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,910
news thing sets the piece and when

1069
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:31,800
displayed the guys didn't even barely

1070
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,420
knew they were broken into and what he's

1071
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,770
saying that they've reached into the

1072
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,300
control system they weren't aware and

1073
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,099
everything at the end of the first day

1074
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:40,320
they end up disconnecting the

1075
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,630
connections between the control the IT

1076
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:45,119
systems that they use this RDP jump

1077
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,520
server and the ICS feeling protected the

1078
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,460
next day starts they're happy about this

1079
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,260
level of disconnection operating on

1080
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,510
manual controls and we invited

1081
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:56,040
distinguished visitor and this is the

1082
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,109
crazy sequence we didn't plan carefully

1083
00:44:58,109 --> 00:45:00,330
we had to do the seniors command they

1084
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,280
get a briefing and our idea is that the

1085
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,570
moment that the briefing is happening

1086
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:09,270
with the attackers are going to break in

1087
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:11,010
and shut down the cooling system and the

1088
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:13,530
reactor is going to scram and we had you

1089
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:15,710
know said not so realistically that the

1090
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:17,700
plant is powered by its own nuclear

1091
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,380
reactor so the lights are going to go

1092
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,990
down so we've got this complex sequence

1093
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,420
of event and in this scenario the

1094
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,280
attacker is a nation-state they hired it

1095
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,920
while they recruited a local guy

1096
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,030
presented themselves as Greenpeace

1097
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,980
saying you need to go over to this plan

1098
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,250
to take Radio radioactivity measurements

1099
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,080
for us and I'm okay Wow

1100
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,060
put this in this truck and this laptop

1101
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,100
at this sensor but it's not a sensor

1102
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,160
it's the Wi-Fi connection to the

1103
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,530
Raspberry Pi that was introduced in the

1104
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:50,240
networks and through this and a 4G link

1105
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,580
Mike was able to come in over a c2

1106
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:56,280
system on Amazon and then come down the

1107
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,390
the the 4G network jump onto the Wi-Fi

1108
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:03,180
system onto the plant and then we on the

1109
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,910
Raspberry Pi execute some code and have

1110
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:08,310
the ICS system shut down and that

1111
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,020
raspberry pi was put in place by

1112
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,630
breaking into the physical system

1113
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:14,580
opening the access control deleting some

1114
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,140
while we didn't delete videos on this

1115
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,380
one first one I think we did you stop

1116
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,780
the recording when this was put in place

1117
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,180
and then and then the attack happened

1118
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,680
but this sequence they didn't know how

1119
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,760
long it would take for all these

1120
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,200
connections because the laptop is

1121
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,990
calling back and we're trying to time

1122
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:32,850
this with the distinguished visitors and

1123
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:36,270
there's a row of us in the room you know

1124
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,310
sending a thumbs-up signal go for the

1125
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:41,100
attack and we wanted the audio to come

1126
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,860
in of the alert of the ICS kits and this

1127
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,020
kit is downstairs in the basement so we

1128
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,990
even had two of my kids laptop connected

1129
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:51,750
with netcat piping the audio all the way

1130
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:54,510
to the top room anyways crazy stuff but

1131
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:56,670
it worked like a charm and I have a few

1132
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:58,590
slides on this so this is when the

1133
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:01,200
seniors were being briefed we had a guy

1134
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,300
with the breaker and when the the whole

1135
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,280
system went down he just killed the

1136
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,960
breaker in the room and we had this

1137
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,670
light that turned on automatically and

1138
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:11,070
all the monitors went out and this is

1139
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,950
exactly at the moment when we had I

1140
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,510
think he was the head of the office of

1141
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:18,150
nuclear regulation of the UK asking the

1142
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,650
participants for the briefing so he's a

1143
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,290
senior exact same and he just said is my

1144
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,120
plants safe do you think the hackers are

1145
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,610
out of the network and I says yes sir

1146
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,260
you're totally safe there's no problem

1147
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,000
and just the lights one struck right at

1148
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,990
that moment and this a large

1149
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:35,900
alarm comes on

1150
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,809
warning warning that all that so that

1151
00:47:38,809 --> 00:47:41,450
was pretty funny and this is completely

1152
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:44,000
unrealistic okay that doesn't work this

1153
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,690
way but still it really draws them into

1154
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:49,220
this in our in the story and they're all

1155
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,770
like want to do this work so then they

1156
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:53,619
go off and we restore the electricity

1157
00:47:53,619 --> 00:47:56,119
they start investigating and here

1158
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:57,770
they're looking at the captured video

1159
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:59,539
footage which of course we film days

1160
00:47:59,539 --> 00:48:01,700
before and we're inserting with a script

1161
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,349
into the video system because it's not a

1162
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:06,170
happening live picture of somebody at

1163
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:08,869
the ICS kit and then when they look more

1164
00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:10,760
carefully you'll see I get the laser

1165
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,119
again here is a Raspberry Pi that's been

1166
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:16,549
inserted into the ICS and plugged in and

1167
00:48:16,549 --> 00:48:19,069
when they discovered this they kind of

1168
00:48:19,069 --> 00:48:21,109
say okay well we reported and we're

1169
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:22,970
role-playing the security officer and

1170
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:25,369
everything and when we got to designing

1171
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:28,760
this part of this scenario okay I've got

1172
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,230
like 12 minutes and I got two more

1173
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:32,599
videos I'll try to go quickly we said

1174
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:33,920
what would happen and we talked to the

1175
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,230
UK they said well we'd you know if

1176
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:38,839
there's a van outside with a Wi-Fi

1177
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:40,369
access point there's security so I

1178
00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:42,319
googled what security at the UK nuclear

1179
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,579
power plant and they have this civil

1180
00:48:43,579 --> 00:48:46,430
nuclear Constabulary force and which are

1181
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:48,349
like SWAT teams and everything so okay

1182
00:48:48,349 --> 00:48:50,839
we need a SWAT team so the beauty about

1183
00:48:50,839 --> 00:48:53,089
Estonia is it's a small country and you

1184
00:48:53,089 --> 00:48:55,039
can get anything you want so I make this

1185
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,200
phone call that person I met I asked her

1186
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,200
send an email to a guy and he's ends up

1187
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,400
being in the police and everything he

1188
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,690
says well what kind of people you want

1189
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,339
and I say well I need the kind of

1190
00:49:04,339 --> 00:49:06,710
special people he says okay well go meet

1191
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,990
this guy so I show up over there and

1192
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:11,299
this is the SWAT team you can tell all

1193
00:49:11,299 --> 00:49:13,220
the guys like oh and then there's kit

1194
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:14,569
everywhere and everything I sit down

1195
00:49:14,569 --> 00:49:15,890
with them I said this is this an hour

1196
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,480
when a guy doesn't speak too much

1197
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,160
English kind of huh what do you want

1198
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,359
well I want to Vigo's he says black BMW

1199
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:25,910
x5 yeah that's good and he says how big

1200
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:29,059
the guns big guns small guns average

1201
00:49:29,059 --> 00:49:31,700
average and he says is that it I said no

1202
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,500
I need all of your radio communications

1203
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,089
everything you say on the radio I want

1204
00:49:35,089 --> 00:49:36,680
it taped and I want you to give it to me

1205
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,480
with the footage I want head cams and

1206
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,710
everything and I want to bring that in

1207
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:40,910
it's okay

1208
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:43,369
so then we call somebody else and say I

1209
00:49:43,369 --> 00:49:44,869
need it like something that looks like

1210
00:49:44,869 --> 00:49:46,520
your nuclear power plant so there's a

1211
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,069
military base there we can go okay let's

1212
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:49,580
go there

1213
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,800
anyways we get everything set up we

1214
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,960
prepare for the filming and then we film

1215
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,120
the takedown of this guy sitting in the

1216
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,030
van and the problem is is that the audio

1217
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:01,640
is not good we the SWAT team guys they

1218
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,990
just want to go all the time so I'm

1219
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:04,310
there and I'm trying to beat them

1220
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:05,690
and I'm telling that this is what you

1221
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:08,630
need to do you need to rest this guy do

1222
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,160
whatever you do as a police force but

1223
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,840
you need to ask him to log onto the

1224
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,210
server onto the laptop this was part of

1225
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,790
our scenario I'll really do that ask him

1226
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:18,950
can you log on and it said okay and we

1227
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,870
just don't have time it's just going so

1228
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,340
quickly and everything so we get set up

1229
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,720
in everything and they do all of their

1230
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:27,350
thing but we don't have it perfectly

1231
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:29,750
well on the audio and they're Estonian

1232
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,910
but so they don't speak good British

1233
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:34,130
English so then I have a problem about

1234
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:35,420
the audio because you can look at the

1235
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:36,740
movie it's beautiful but the sound

1236
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,700
doesn't explain it

1237
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,870
so Mike flies in on Friday and invite

1238
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:43,280
him over this is just before the

1239
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,740
exercise on Saturday serve him a few

1240
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,050
glasses of wine to him and Eve who was

1241
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:49,850
on his team and then I say guys I need

1242
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:51,500
some help I got this video I need some

1243
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,870
voice over and I wrote this script and I

1244
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:56,660
get Mike to read the script and I take

1245
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,270
my home little radios and I give him one

1246
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,400
of my radios and I go in my washing

1247
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,130
machine room and I put my iPhone and I

1248
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:05,870
record my end of the radio and I get

1249
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:07,940
these two guys to talk to each other to

1250
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,400
you know do a new voiceover for the

1251
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,890
script and then I spend Sunday merging

1252
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:15,140
that into the video and then we play it

1253
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,600
during the week at the exercise and in

1254
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,850
essence this is what it gives I think

1255
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:23,660
this is it yeah so this is the band

1256
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:27,430
outside the nuclear power plant

1257
00:51:56,830 --> 00:52:19,970
these guys were perfect they're gonna

1258
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:30,560
come out there and the guy in the van is

1259
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,370
our Sisson man we didn't tell him we

1260
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:41,540
didn't tell him anything just come for a

1261
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:45,000
movie it's okay don't worry about it

1262
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,329
[Music]

1263
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:03,980
here so this is the part that breaks

1264
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:08,329
down we told him he's got a login but we

1265
00:53:08,329 --> 00:53:11,119
told him do your police work which is

1266
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,019
coffee first

1267
00:53:53,569 --> 00:53:57,599
so the guys were not expecting this at

1268
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:04,259
all and they were like all like what is

1269
00:54:04,259 --> 00:54:06,569
this you know kind of thing and after

1270
00:54:06,569 --> 00:54:09,029
this played about five minutes later we

1271
00:54:09,029 --> 00:54:11,249
gave them the actual laptop that had

1272
00:54:11,249 --> 00:54:13,589
been used and all the evidence was still

1273
00:54:13,589 --> 00:54:17,549
on it and this piece we didn't realize

1274
00:54:17,549 --> 00:54:21,839
it this went so fast we didn't see that

1275
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,549
he was asking to log on with this

1276
00:54:23,549 --> 00:54:25,559
handcuff it's only after we got back

1277
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:27,449
were editing the clip we're like what is

1278
00:54:27,449 --> 00:54:40,589
that and so you thought Mike was a great

1279
00:54:40,589 --> 00:54:43,049
hacker he's also a great actor for the

1280
00:54:43,049 --> 00:54:45,269
voice-over I mean that voice was perfect

1281
00:54:45,269 --> 00:54:47,789
him and Evie was also excellent it was

1282
00:54:47,789 --> 00:54:50,640
just the greatest so that was that was

1283
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,650
the takedown at the end and it was

1284
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:54,690
really like really fun to see them all

1285
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:57,449
like see that and then the laptop we

1286
00:54:57,449 --> 00:54:58,890
gave it to them and asked them to do

1287
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:01,559
some file carving and I don't think they

1288
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:04,259
ever got to it in the end but if the

1289
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,940
file carved on that laptop

1290
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,430
they found this that we placed in there

1291
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,680
this is a rental document from a nearby

1292
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,349
airport from the powerplant skegness

1293
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:16,890
with a rental of course having some name

1294
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:20,759
some credit card information in it and

1295
00:55:20,759 --> 00:55:23,599
passport information as well somewhere

1296
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,369
and then in the end this is all fake

1297
00:55:26,369 --> 00:55:28,739
because this is you know rented by the

1298
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:30,599
enemy but still it's information that's

1299
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:32,910
useful and the other thing that's in

1300
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:35,640
there was a picture on it can you tell

1301
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,200
me something about you know if you find

1302
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,980
a picture what can you get as info

1303
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:43,260
geolocation so we change the geotag of

1304
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,990
this to match to a nearby hotel in

1305
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:48,420
Skegness so now if you found this

1306
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,070
picture you looked at the Geo tag you

1307
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:52,170
get a hotel you can send the police

1308
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:54,090
there and there might be evidence in the

1309
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:55,560
room fingerprints and things like that

1310
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,030
can you tell me something else about the

1311
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:03,510
picture look at the picture so this is

1312
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:05,190
the driver that got arrested he was

1313
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,990
recruited by the foreign intelligence

1314
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:09,420
agent humans on the ground that is

1315
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,640
recruited and told him Greenpeace laptop

1316
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:15,540
go measure radiation look here there's a

1317
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:19,610
face reflection on the side of the TV

1318
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:22,410
you have a picture of the guy and that's

1319
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:24,780
the guy who you see on the Avis report

1320
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,270
right in here it's not clear on some

1321
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:29,580
different displays but his face as a

1322
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:31,620
reflection there so if you carved it

1323
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,690
hard when you get this out you get a

1324
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,940
picture of the bad guy you get a fake

1325
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:38,220
passport number if a credit card number

1326
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,740
a flight number and you can harass them

1327
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,480
at the at the border when he tries to

1328
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,550
leave the country all of these details

1329
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:47,340
were completely planned synched up and

1330
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,590
created into the environment prepared it

1331
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:52,380
you know and then delivered on to the

1332
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,960
network's everywhere and then played out

1333
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,790
live with the attacks synchronized with

1334
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,770
all the actions and that's a real

1335
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:01,080
engaging scenario and the people who go

1336
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,820
through that you know and handle all

1337
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,080
this if there's a bunch of stuff that

1338
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,090
makes no sense the arrests bring the van

1339
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,890
back in everything doesn't matter it's

1340
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:10,080
just becoming such a great activity that

1341
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,180
it's you know worth a lot more and these

1342
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:14,190
details don't take a lot of time to do

1343
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,840
you just got to think about it and

1344
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,260
develop this richness so we got three

1345
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,540
minutes left and we did I've got this

1346
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:25,800
video and I just let it play this is

1347
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,300
what it looks like this was the gas

1348
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,430
exercise and we had this fake pipeline

1349
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:32,190
that got hacked and flow of gas was

1350
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:33,720
stopped but the readings were saying the

1351
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,590
gas was flowing so by the time that they

1352
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:38,940
were running out of gas people

1353
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,770
complaining then they had to see no the

1354
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:42,060
pipeline's fine no actually it's

1355
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,590
half-empty and it'll take two days to

1356
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:45,630
fill up and they do all the analysis but

1357
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:46,599
the images just give

1358
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:48,609
feeling for how we set things up in the

1359
00:57:48,609 --> 00:57:50,710
office and we build all of these

1360
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:52,269
displays and everything so that they

1361
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:54,789
have this workstations to to do the work

1362
00:57:54,789 --> 00:57:56,650
and do the analysis plan things out

1363
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:58,569
working as a team with people coming in

1364
00:57:58,569 --> 00:58:01,029
and out of the rooms where we place each

1365
00:58:01,029 --> 00:58:04,180
team's I'll skip ahead there's another

1366
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,769
exercise we did and I'll finish with

1367
00:58:05,769 --> 00:58:07,690
this video I promise we're about

1368
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:10,390
completely done now with the financial

1369
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:12,670
sector exercise and then again we

1370
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:15,640
delivered it twice first time 24 then 30

1371
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,349
participants organized in four or five

1372
00:58:17,349 --> 00:58:19,509
teams each is a stock of a financial

1373
00:58:19,509 --> 00:58:22,029
institution and we created this IT

1374
00:58:22,029 --> 00:58:24,249
environment with banking operations we

1375
00:58:24,249 --> 00:58:27,819
actually build the cardboard version of

1376
00:58:27,819 --> 00:58:30,519
a banks reserve management system that

1377
00:58:30,519 --> 00:58:32,710
implements the swift protocol and as the

1378
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,930
messaging and we work with the domain

1379
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:37,690
experts to actually know how that works

1380
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,819
what are the roles what people do how do

1381
00:58:39,819 --> 00:58:42,069
you move money around and then we had

1382
00:58:42,069 --> 00:58:43,930
also a little bit of a they wanted some

1383
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:46,059
ICS system to control the heating and

1384
00:58:46,059 --> 00:58:48,160
cooling at the data center and we

1385
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,960
included in this one also again a

1386
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,390
simulated law-enforcement engagement so

1387
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:54,670
we had Interpol on the case and when

1388
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:56,349
they started they already had video

1389
00:58:56,349 --> 00:58:59,349
surveillance of the hackers that there

1390
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:01,660
were at their site and they've started

1391
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,190
and gave them more and more information

1392
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:04,599
and engage them with enforcement

1393
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:07,239
completely unrealistic just there to you

1394
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:09,160
know entertain and keep keep the stuff

1395
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:13,599
coin I got this call there I think we're

1396
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:15,099
done it's the coffee break so if you

1397
00:59:15,099 --> 00:59:16,960
want to go you can go this video is

1398
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,420
about two minutes and I think the other

1399
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:23,140
one is six minutes so this is the guy

1400
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:25,420
that plays the case officer in an

1401
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:31,450
Interpol and we have this lady that's in

1402
00:59:31,450 --> 00:59:36,538
Estonia who's the case officer

1403
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:40,799
this case for the past couple of weeks

1404
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:44,140
we are certain right now that the

1405
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:46,029
operations that the suspects are

1406
00:59:46,029 --> 01:00:06,309
conducting or criminal so we did this in

1407
01:00:06,309 --> 01:00:08,109
the basement of a Ministry of Defense

1408
01:00:08,109 --> 01:01:14,769
Building which we set up so we place

1409
01:01:14,769 --> 01:01:16,599
hence of what they need to look at

1410
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:18,549
inside the network and peace offers are

1411
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:27,819
banking on software we wrote so this is

1412
01:01:27,819 --> 01:01:30,039
a way to engage them into this story to

1413
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:32,470
give them hints of what to look at now

1414
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:34,839
the hint MP software then they went on

1415
01:01:34,839 --> 01:01:36,279
in that direction started to look at

1416
01:01:36,279 --> 01:01:37,660
that there was a supply chain

1417
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:40,739
vulnerability the company got hacked

1418
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,940
software came in with a vulnerability

1419
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,890
that would hide certain payments and

1420
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:46,930
then they went in and did those payments

1421
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:49,119
in the system actually hid the payments

1422
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,180
they couldn't tell so we

1423
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:53,119
the hackers stole you know in the end

1424
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,490
many many millions of euros out of the

1425
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:57,440
bank and that went unnoticed for quite a

1426
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,630
while I'm showing you this because this

1427
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:01,369
is the part that we engage them with

1428
01:02:01,369 --> 01:02:03,319
keeps them interested into the scenario

1429
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:05,660
I have one more and I think that's

1430
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,549
pretty much it with the takeaways after

1431
01:02:07,549 --> 01:02:10,010
and this is the end of it when we're

1432
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:12,410
reaching the climax and this is where we

1433
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:14,450
only again painted ourselves in a corner

1434
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:16,279
and having 20 seconds to do an attack

1435
01:02:16,279 --> 01:02:18,500
again and this is the final sequence of

1436
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:25,220
that exercise and this guy is simulating

1437
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:28,220
Interpol background is actually the

1438
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:56,480
9-1-1 room in a surveillance we saw they

1439
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:03,380
don't have the rifle and again we got

1440
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,750
the k commandos from estonia to come and

1441
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:14,420
do this this is a real police what this

1442
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,849
is when mike is going to do the attack

1443
01:03:16,849 --> 01:03:18,920
at the exact moment the guys are in the

1444
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,470
room typing and this attack they've been

1445
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:25,039
set up with a snort alert that will

1446
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,230
trigger when the packets bye-bye and

1447
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:29,210
we're they're simulating having the call

1448
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:31,520
with these guys and then yeah we see the

1449
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,680
attack and then when all of the calls

1450
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,720
come in then they decide to go because

1451
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,880
the week they caught the hackers

1452
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,480
red-handed into the networks so we come

1453
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:44,680
back to this setup here

1454
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:59,750
so these old sequences we had to film

1455
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:01,010
and put together and we don't always

1456
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:03,320
plan it well so some are pretty rough a

1457
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:13,820
bit but they kind of work there's a

1458
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:42,260
soundtrack that's not coming although

1459
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:46,210
this is reaching for something here

1460
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:48,590
we're splitting the cash I'm calling it

1461
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:56,420
now we printed fake bills this is fun to

1462
01:04:56,420 --> 01:05:04,160
do punch they're getting me to go under

1463
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,589
the SWAT team now I need you guys to

1464
01:05:06,589 --> 01:05:08,839
keep a lookout on the network traffic so

1465
01:05:08,839 --> 01:05:12,560
we can give them the signal so now at

1466
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,570
this point is the point where mike is

1467
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:17,150
actually pressing you know enter and

1468
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:19,490
doing all of the bank transactions

1469
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:21,770
through his backdoors into the network

1470
01:05:21,770 --> 01:05:25,760
which causes one of the alerts on on IOC

1471
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,339
on this to trigger and then they're all

1472
01:05:28,339 --> 01:05:34,339
calling in so it took us a while to

1473
01:05:34,339 --> 01:05:36,050
build that room and film everything but

1474
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:37,640
we do that two weeks in advance and then

1475
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,740
we can't control the footage anymore we

1476
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:47,540
have to work with what this time they

1477
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:49,210
dressed up the usual way they do and

1478
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:51,859
they did their tactic so this is not

1479
01:05:51,859 --> 01:05:53,599
realistic they wouldn't do it this way

1480
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,849
they told us how they would do it but

1481
01:05:55,849 --> 01:05:58,940
you know little bit of Hollywood you'll

1482
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:03,349
see them coming here and this computer

1483
01:06:03,349 --> 01:06:05,150
is the server with the data and that's

1484
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:06,529
the power switches if you kill that

1485
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:11,229
power switch you lose the encrypted data

1486
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:15,799
and in this one I wanted a bit more

1487
01:06:15,799 --> 01:06:18,430
action than the first one so this door

1488
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:24,489
we built in there so they could break in

1489
01:06:24,849 --> 01:06:27,739
and they're coming out they dismounted

1490
01:06:27,739 --> 01:06:32,229
the vehicles approaching the door

1491
01:06:33,759 --> 01:06:36,380
we should be getting that camera video

1492
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:44,710
audio here pretty shortly there we go

1493
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:48,170
all right they're getting ready to

1494
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:49,520
breach they live for me isn't there

1495
01:06:49,520 --> 01:07:01,550
flashbangs you're sure this is the crazy

1496
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,740
thing that the cops asked to use flash

1497
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:04,760
grenades

1498
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:11,530
it wasn't our idea I'm inside the

1499
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:15,890
Ministry of Defense building barely have

1500
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:17,330
permissions to be there build my own

1501
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:20,180
door and that cops come in with all

1502
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:23,090
their gear and asking to use flash

1503
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:25,760
grenades and you never say no to a cop

1504
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,830
it's holy okay I guess and this is the

1505
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:32,869
bit about this story that wanted some

1506
01:07:32,869 --> 01:07:35,950
bit of action in there

1507
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:53,440
and that was that was our Sisson min and

1508
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,690
you know we practiced this and we only

1509
01:07:56,690 --> 01:07:58,400
had one shot with the door so that was

1510
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,290
the final shot but we filmed this 12

1511
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:03,440
times and they threw like three you can

1512
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:04,600
stop it

1513
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,190
they they threw in three flash grenades

1514
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:09,230
they're the real stuff they asked for

1515
01:08:09,230 --> 01:08:11,210
this and I'm like are you can you and

1516
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:13,100
then they said yeah sure no worries and

1517
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:14,780
then they taped up the smoke detectors

1518
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:16,069
because it would trigger the building

1519
01:08:16,069 --> 01:08:17,630
fire alarm and everything like what are

1520
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:20,359
we doing here anyways they had to film

1521
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:23,359
it 12 times and then the one of the our

1522
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:25,220
guys wanted to resist on the first time

1523
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:28,010
so he did that and he didn't do it on

1524
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:29,510
the next scenes anyways it was a lot of

1525
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:34,850
fun that was the I guess the takeaways

1526
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:38,180
very quickly Mike if you let me make

1527
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,859
them custom they need to meet your

1528
01:08:39,859 --> 01:08:42,140
client specific need for this you need

1529
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:43,819
the main knowledge you don't have that

1530
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:45,830
higher and then you bring in that

1531
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,859
knowledge the richness and the realism

1532
01:08:48,859 --> 01:08:50,870
of the technical and operational needs

1533
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:54,350
to be absolutely perfect and you need to

1534
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:55,910
provide your team with very good blue

1535
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:57,290
team tools because there's not a lot of

1536
01:08:57,290 --> 01:09:03,680
time and the whole simulation of the end

1537
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,089
user and system and then talk too much

1538
01:09:05,089 --> 01:09:06,200
about that that has to be very

1539
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,870
responsive and then you also can get

1540
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:10,580
them to talk to senior management under

1541
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:11,810
pressure that's a good thing

1542
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:14,390
and this reales 'm is important this

1543
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:16,100
scenario will being engaging really

1544
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,750
makes them want to do the work is that

1545
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:20,600
realistic not at all but it really

1546
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:23,000
helped and every time we ask them do you

1547
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,979
like this stuff is it good and they

1548
01:09:24,979 --> 01:09:27,770
always say yes so this has been success

1549
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:29,779
for us so I guess that's all I have I'm

1550
01:09:29,779 --> 01:09:31,850
really sorry about the you know taking

1551
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:34,060
you all

1552
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:48,499
