[Music]

2
00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:08,490
so as mentioned my name is Mark Briard

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,990
I'm the CTO for the government Canada

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,759
I'm leaving the transformation of the

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,759
GCSE IT infrastructure environment and

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,529
this is in support of the digital

7
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:19,619
transformation so you've probably heard

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,480
this a lot but we're we have a lot of

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,080
push about transforming to more modern

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,420
more agile ways of doing things being

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,060
very user centric and IT infrastructure

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,700
and specifically cybersecurity are there

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,829
as critical components to support that

14
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,440
journey so I'm here today to speak to

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,870
you about the business of tomorrow where

16
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,190
we're going and the government of

17
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,640
Canada's journey to zero trust you gotta

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,440
love the headlines there's no shortage

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,590
of them and I'm sure like us every time

20
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,090
you see a new headline or your deputy

21
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,280
sees a new headline you get a phone call

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,579
you get an ask for a briefing it's a

23
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,910
constant evolution the cyber breaches

24
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,299
don't stop the bad guys don't stop the

25
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,140
threat is asymmetric we have to patch

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,420
every hole we have to find every

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,939
vulnerability they only have to find one

28
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,750
so it's a constant battle technology

29
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,420
keeps evolving and organizations are

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,150
still struggling to do basic hygiene we

31
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,509
are dealing with a massive legacy

32
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:30,500
infrastructure aging IT infrastructure

33
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,759
while we're trying to do digital

34
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,500
transformation while we're trying to

35
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,500
modernize and provide better service to

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,180
Canadians so it's a very complicated

37
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,750
landscape and it's ever-changing with

38
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,460
the rise of cloud computing software as

39
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,869
a service applications and mobile

40
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,450
devices company systems and workforces

41
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,369
are no longer confined to the office or

42
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,979
the data center the fact is breaking

43
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,270
down the walls of the traditional

44
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,310
perimeter based security methods where

45
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,079
trust is determined purely by being on

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,000
the inside of the outside no longer work

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,460
as we've seen from the numerous

48
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,110
cyberattacks that have made the news on

49
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,390
a regular basis once an actor gains

50
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,239
privileged access inside our walls they

51
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,340
have free rein and oftentimes they can

52
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,630
go on undetected for long periods of

53
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,660
time in addition there's an increasing

54
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,160
burden on cybersecurity provincial

55
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,010
professionals yourselves the adversary's

56
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,260
can focus nearly endless resources and

57
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,110
use commercially available or easily to

58
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,420
obtain tools to gain access or to try to

59
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,940
gain access to our networks we are

60
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,430
endlessly trying to patch watch what's

61
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,580
happening on the network implement new

62
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,620
tools and all with limited and often

63
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,840
diminishing returns this is not a

64
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,640
sustainable model we need a new model

65
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,700
the old walls don't work traditionally

66
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,230
this has been a castle and mode approach

67
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,050
we build perimeters we focus a lot on

68
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,060
securing the perimeters and once a

69
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,680
breach occurs once they're in the

70
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,530
perimeter we often lose visibility these

71
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,120
traditional security architectures were

72
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,710
built with two groups in mind the

73
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,600
trusted individuals those who are

74
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,430
allowed to access data inside the

75
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,160
organization and untrusted individuals

76
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,750
that are meant to be kept on the outside

77
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,500
and very us in them approach so security

78
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,720
19 teams invested in defensive systems

79
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,330
that protected the barrier between them

80
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,650
focusing heavily on security of network

81
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,250
perimeter basically offer often relying

82
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,350
on firewalls with increase in complexity

83
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,710
and challenges to maintain while they

84
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,060
were successful in building a wall

85
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,980
between potential threats and the safety

86
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,620
of the corporate ecosystems this full

87
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,810
trust model is problematic because when

88
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,160
the perimeter is breached and attacker

89
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,900
is relatively easy access to everything

90
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,340
on the company's privileged intranet

91
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,070
intranet and not to mention the havoc an

92
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,470
insider threat can pose without even

93
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,440
having to breach the perimeter the

94
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,090
thinking that the four walls of a

95
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,040
company were protected then threats

96
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,420
would be neutralized before they come

97
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,250
anywhere near our core IT infrastructure

98
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,750
is false the advent of

99
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,670
bring-your-own-device mobile devices

100
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,790
cloud computing and api accessible

101
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,020
systems has blurred those traditional

102
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,790
barriers and made the environment even

103
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,610
more complex

104
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,600
additionally adversaries continue to

105
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,070
find creative methods of getting around

106
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,750
perimeter security such as social

107
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,668
engineering attacks that manipulate

108
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:23,320
users into giving away their credentials

109
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,770
we've all seen this phishing attacks

110
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,490
social engineering

111
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,889
the user is often the weakest link and

112
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:32,440
yet once the perimeter has been breached

113
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,169
we have no visibility into that the

114
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:37,000
network expansion and adversary

115
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,069
creativity requires increasing numbers

116
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:40,840
of firewalls with complex inspection

117
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,030
specifications which is cost intensive

118
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,639
and diminished with diminishing returns

119
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,979
not to mention that impact this has on

120
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:49,900
the performance of our networks and the

121
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,349
impact on the user experience perimeter

122
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:55,120
security rapidly devolves into a game of

123
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,979
whack-a-mole where firewalls must

124
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:58,569
constantly be adjusted to account for an

125
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:00,130
expanding set of authorized entrants

126
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,229
into the network and acceptable traffic

127
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:04,150
in and out of the network these

128
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,130
firewalls will frequently duplicate

129
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,840
efforts creating burdensome and costly

130
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,160
infrastructure that is largely

131
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,320
ineffective and also very hard to debug

132
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,930
when we have to find problems at the

133
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,430
same time privileged users with access

134
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,500
to large numbers of systems and their

135
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,030
high-value information have become an

136
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,889
obvious point of attack and their

137
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:22,360
identities and credentials are under

138
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,520
constant threat unfortunately with these

139
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,139
realities keeping malware out of our

140
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:27,759
enterprise environment is a losing

141
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:34,330
battle so where do we want to go in a

142
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,120
cloud and mobile world more people want

143
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,460
access to more resources and data from

144
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,199
more devices and locations than ever

145
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,810
before the increasing adoption of mobile

146
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,400
technologies has resulted in a remote

147
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,469
workforce where work is increasingly

148
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:49,960
done outside the corporate network the

149
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,820
rise of cloud connected mobile and

150
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,830
remote workforces has shifted visibility

151
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,960
and control of users and devices outside

152
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,930
the enterprise services and assets today

153
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,020
aren't contained inside your perimeter

154
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,039
organizations are purposefully extending

155
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,659
themselves opening up the traditional

156
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:06,669
enterprise barriers and we're driving

157
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:09,400
this change the the principle of

158
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,409
government as a platform is all about

159
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:14,919
enabling better integration API access

160
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:17,530
to systems blurring the boundaries

161
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,539
between what a government system is and

162
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:21,759
what a service is delivered to Canadians

163
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,710
so this is not going to slow down and in

164
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,729
fact it's going to get more and more

165
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:30,460
complicated so security versus user

166
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:30,980
expect

167
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,570
patience this is a constant balancing

168
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,310
act for security practitioners

169
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,340
protecting the assets but also enabling

170
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,800
the users if you go too far one way you

171
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,390
lock your network down too much and

172
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,460
encourage user workarounds if you go too

173
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,080
far the other way you don't have

174
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,210
adequate protections we always said the

175
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,600
most secure network is one with no users

176
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,150
but not quite as useful users want to

177
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,410
have access to information and services

178
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,140
from one wherever we are using whatever

179
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,500
platform we choose as service enablers

180
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,300
we have an increasing duty to be

181
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,980
responsive and provide a solution that

182
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,500
meets the changing expectations as

183
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,940
security professionals we need to

184
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,620
balance the service expectations with

185
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,630
appropriate safeguards to protect the

186
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,790
confidentiality the integrity and the

187
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,260
availability of those services and

188
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,350
supporting information systems as an

189
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,180
enterprise we need to apply smart rules

190
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,460
to ensure fair and balanced access to

191
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,710
services we have to apply risk-based

192
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,410
methodologies and ultimately we need to

193
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,210
adopt a balanced approach that considers

194
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,430
user needs supported by a pragmatic

195
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,440
security approach resulting in more

196
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,460
secure environments so what does that

197
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,960
look like I love this slide

198
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,700
fundamentally we can put all the

199
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,730
security controls we want in place users

200
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,710
will find a way around they will find a

201
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,780
way to get the job done so we have to

202
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,620
understand what the user perspective is

203
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,550
security needs to get out of the know

204
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,650
business and into the yes business in

205
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,170
fact this is our number one digital

206
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,780
standard you must design systems with

207
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,240
the user in mind this doesn't just apply

208
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,630
to UX UI design application development

209
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,180
it also applies to security controls

210
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,450
when you implement a security control

211
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,460
understand how it impacts the user

212
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,540
understand how the user is likely to

213
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,990
react and adapt make it useful for them

214
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,760
make it so that it's invisible to them

215
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,860
while protecting the the informations

216
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,190
assets that you're trying to protect

217
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,240
doing security for the sake of security

218
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,390
doesn't always work and in fact putting

219
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,789
a control that forces the user outside

220
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:37,280
of the box is actually lowering the

221
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,760
security of your systems we all went

222
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,669
through this 10 15 years ago complex

223
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,949
security password

224
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:49,129
password resets not allowing repeats of

225
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:52,009
passwords these were perceived to

226
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,629
increase the security of those passwords

227
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:55,639
and yet what did they do they drove

228
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,230
users to writing them down on sticky

229
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,670
notes and putting them under keyboards

230
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,309
this was effectively a reduction of the

231
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:03,410
security posture by implementing more

232
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:10,009
security so at the end of the day it's

233
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:12,230
your responsibility when you implement a

234
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,360
control to ensure you understand what

235
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,189
the impact is of those controls on the

236
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,470
user base also making sure that they're

237
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,209
measured and they're appropriate to the

238
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:23,439
risk level that you're trying to protect

239
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:27,220
so the new paradigm shift is the

240
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,199
transformation to zero trust where we

241
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:32,269
take the old perimeter and we break it

242
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:36,920
apart and include many more devices and

243
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,209
networks that have access most

244
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:42,860
enterprise security models have tended

245
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,629
to employ a verify than trust method

246
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:46,610
which means if someone has the correct

247
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,529
user credentials they are admitted to

248
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:50,120
whichever site app or device they were

249
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,180
requesting and they have full access

250
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,259
this model doesn't work in today's

251
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:56,360
business climate and as a result many

252
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,800
organizations have been subject to

253
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,899
malware and ransomware attacks and data

254
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,790
breaches that have impacted their brands

255
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,910
in their bottom lines in today's new

256
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,500
threat landscape building a strong

257
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,850
perimeter based on a hierarchical

258
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,559
Network design is no longer an effective

259
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:12,410
approach to security notions of trust

260
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,480
but verify are outdated and extremely

261
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,920
vulnerable to a plethora of cyber

262
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,529
attacks cyber criminals have found a

263
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:20,930
multitude of ways to infiltrate at what

264
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,000
walls we have built sometimes using

265
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,490
malicious insiders to positions of trust

266
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,709
on your network whether willingly or

267
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:29,480
unwillingly once they have those

268
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,040
advanced credentials they have free rein

269
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,269
so we need to reassess the current

270
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:37,189
method of perimeter security and are

271
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:38,809
considering new methods such as zero

272
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:40,999
trust which can drive a step change in

273
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:42,350
security improvements across our

274
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,050
networks zero trust security is an

275
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,550
architectural model for network security

276
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,160
is guided by the principle of never

277
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,279
trust and always verify zero trust moves

278
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:53,870
away from the perimeter approach and

279
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,960
instead assumes or

280
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,450
what the name would suggest that the the

281
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:04,020
network is assumed compromised imagine

282
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,760
building an application security model

283
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,800
where you assumed that there was zero

284
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,780
other security on that network there

285
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,490
were zero firewalls there were zero

286
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,620
other credentials is that application

287
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,050
still secure that's the level of trust

288
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,260
we need to get to we need to provide

289
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,520
mechanisms to automate and manage

290
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,310
granularity of access controls

291
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,390
prioritize protection of data and

292
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,690
information at as core assets enable

293
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,190
ease of access for users who are

294
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,870
transparently provided a level of trust

295
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,600
based on established policies and take

296
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,280
advantage of investments already be made

297
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,830
in an enterprise where we can build

298
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,750
platforms that provide services to

299
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,170
improve security functions by assuming

300
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,700
that the network is compromised security

301
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,980
can take a more nuanced approach by

302
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,750
guarding access to the resources within

303
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,370
the network and building strong

304
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,380
authentication and authorization

305
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,180
standards to allow specific access based

306
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,390
on user and device specific attributes

307
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,530
zero trust operates on a lease

308
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,930
privileged access model by only granting

309
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,340
users and devices access to the

310
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,560
application services and data that are

311
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,090
absolutely necessary for their role

312
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,880
within the organization so for all my

313
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,430
age EC colleagues how many of you are in

314
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,500
organizations where you have

315
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,450
provisioning systems that automatically

316
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,480
react to HR events such as someone

317
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,340
getting transferred to another

318
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:24,030
department does anyone have that so

319
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,760
automatically we know that events are

320
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,470
taking place changes are taking place to

321
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,750
the needs to access the network and the

322
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,690
systems on it and there's no real-time

323
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,050
controls that that monitor that so

324
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,800
automatically we know that there are

325
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,750
people that have access that should that

326
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,450
no longer require it we need to address

327
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,700
those issues and make sure that only the

328
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,290
people who ever need to know and a need

329
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,170
to access are granted roles on the

330
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,040
systems zero trust moves us to a more

331
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,530
data centric approach protecting data as

332
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,810
the core asset while also ensuring ease

333
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:02,370
of access transparency to users so in

334
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,050
our target states we would have a

335
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,520
balance of protection and availability

336
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,150
of GC data across the network requiring

337
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,160
mechanisms that in

338
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,740
access is granted only upon a verified

339
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,160
trust of both the device and the user

340
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,110
context matters the user may have the

341
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,329
right credentials but if they were in

342
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:22,490
Ottawa this morning and China this

343
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,850
afternoon that's probably a flag if they

344
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,670
were working from a trusted device and

345
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,000
now no longer have a trusted device that

346
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,860
may be a change in the in the the risk

347
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,779
posture being able to react to those

348
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:38,420
changes in the in the ways that users

349
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,850
are accessing the systems is critical to

350
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:45,110
providing in enhanced security all

351
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,790
access to GC resources would be

352
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,800
completely authenticated authorized and

353
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,230
encrypted granular controls of GC

354
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,120
resources would be wholly enforced and

355
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,889
the end result would allow clients to

356
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:59,019
work security securely from any location

357
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,610
so what are some of the principles of

358
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,670
zero trust the network is always assumed

359
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,920
to be hostile always assume that there

360
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,420
are threat actors on your network

361
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,769
external and internal threats exist on

362
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,380
the network at all times

363
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,300
network locality is not sufficient in

364
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,300
deciding trust for a network assume that

365
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,500
someone may have compromised that

366
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,199
location every device user and network

367
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:26,259
flow is authenticated and authorized

368
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:28,550
understand what the flow should be what

369
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,069
is the normal pattern of operation there

370
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:33,470
are some very very basic controls that

371
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,970
can be put in place just by using logic

372
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,550
of saying this system is accessed by

373
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,769
this group of people from this location

374
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:41,630
and there's really no need for anyone

375
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,269
outside of that pattern to access it put

376
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:45,889
a control in place that notifies you if

377
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:48,019
someone tries it may be a valid use case

378
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:49,699
but it may also be an indicator of a

379
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:53,089
threat and then policies must be dynamic

380
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:54,829
and calculated from as many sources of

381
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:57,470
data as possible so again looking at the

382
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,860
signals looking at the ability to gather

383
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,110
the information that we have now on how

384
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,550
people are accessing our networks and

385
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,740
our systems allows us to significantly

386
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,769
increase our detection of anomalies

387
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,889
so these are the Foresters five steps to

388
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:20,249
zero trust first and foremost identify

389
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:22,860
your say sensitive data this has to be

390
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,290
the core of what we are doing it's that

391
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,600
hazel date for security it's not to

392
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,610
protect access it's to actually protect

393
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,860
the data doesn't Gail into the hands of

394
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,319
people that shouldn't have it so

395
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:37,470
implementing classification systems data

396
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,050
loss prevention systems even using AI to

397
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,209
do auto classification recognizing

398
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,939
documents and data structures that have

399
00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:46,680
sensitive information there's a lot of

400
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,370
technology in this space this is

401
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,850
critical to providing real-time analysis

402
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,379
of the behaviors that are occurring on

403
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:56,999
the network and being able to prevent

404
00:15:56,999 --> 00:16:00,600
them second map the flows of your

405
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,550
sensitive data again as I just mentioned

406
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,899
understanding what are their usage

407
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,300
patterns and where they're diverting

408
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,790
from the normal and at least raising a

409
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,800
flag you may not want to stop them you

410
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,589
may want to allow for variety for for

411
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:15,689
flexibility but at least understanding

412
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:17,189
that something abnormal has happened and

413
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:19,050
that way you can look at it and you can

414
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,920
adjust architecture near zero trust

415
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,040
micro perimeters so again assuming the

416
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,800
application level security is the only

417
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,250
level of security on the network you

418
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,839
wouldn't do that actually you would have

419
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,540
obviously more perimeter controls more

420
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,500
network security routing but at the end

421
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,620
of the day how many applications in our

422
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,019
zone model have access to data zones

423
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:49,170
where all of your databases live this is

424
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,490
this doesn't make sense if the

425
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,199
application only ever talks to one

426
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:55,829
database so micro zoning and the ability

427
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:58,410
to have flexible software Devine zoning

428
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,149
gives you not only the opportunity to

429
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:02,009
increase the security but it gives you

430
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:03,209
the flexibility to move those

431
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:05,159
applications around without having to

432
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:06,720
completely react detect the security

433
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,990
model continuously monitoring your zero

434
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,490
trust ecosystem with the security

435
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,709
analytics and embracing security

436
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:16,319
automation and orchestration so looking

437
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,079
at Sims looking at building Apple able

438
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,869
to build correlation and extract threat

439
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:24,599
patterns so you can implement new

440
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,109
controls

441
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,980
cloud is a huge opportunity to start

442
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,290
working in this direction in the cloud

443
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,780
you can turn on a firewall you can

444
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,620
activate software-defined networks you

445
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,600
can try new things all at the push of a

446
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,680
button you don't have to buy new

447
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,530
hardware run a pilot put it in a lab see

448
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,840
what happens you can do that virtually

449
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,760
in the cloud environment very quickly

450
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,870
and learn what works and what doesn't

451
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,910
also working with the business to create

452
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,980
these relative end controls is important

453
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,260
the business owners will understand what

454
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,820
those behaviors should be and shouldn't

455
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,650
be and they can give you valuable

456
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,330
insight and how to design these micro

457
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:10,140
perimeters so the outcome is now

458
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,930
contextual we talked about verifying the

459
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,960
user giving access based on what we know

460
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,510
about a user at that point in time are

461
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,070
they still employed in the organization

462
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,630
have they changed jobs has their role

463
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,340
changed you need to be able to have

464
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,400
those signals identity is the new

465
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,320
perimeter it really comes down to who is

466
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,160
trying to access what we have several

467
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,440
initiatives both internally and

468
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,120
externally that are trying to improve

469
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,630
this I can privileged access management

470
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,920
these are all things that are gonna give

471
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,900
you tools at an enterprise level that

472
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,250
you'll be able to implement to better

473
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,270
manage your identity your users identity

474
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,850
then validating the device device based

475
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,030
identities security tokens host based

476
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,370
protection application whitelisting

477
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,710
these are all things that can control

478
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,260
the behaviors of the applications and

479
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,940
minimize the risk that malware gets

480
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,590
installed and does things that it

481
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:09,000
shouldn't do then determining trust

482
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,520
that's really about dynamically putting

483
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,960
all of these information signals

484
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,600
together and assessing at that point in

485
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,330
time from that location for that user

486
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,840
what access permissions they have we've

487
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,540
seen this in in the new Microsoft Office

488
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,210
365 where you will be able to assess the

489
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,210
level of permissions granted based on

490
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,670
whether the user is coming in from their

491
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,130
their laptop or their mobile phone from

492
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,750
within the network or from Starbucks

493
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,580
you'll be able to make decisions that

494
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,310
are contextual and much

495
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,080
more relevant to the real security

496
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,100
threats and then finally learn and adapt

497
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,560
always be modifying don't expect this is

498
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,780
a one-stop journey it's a continual

499
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,210
evolution so make sure you're inspecting

500
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,280
the traffic looking for patterns and

501
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,990
adapting to what could be perceived

502
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,390
threats and as I mentioned earlier

503
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,460
working with the users understanding

504
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,250
their patterns of behavior and adapting

505
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,770
to what makes sense for them there's no

506
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,050
value in a control when the users are

507
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,030
going to try to work around it they

508
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,830
become your threat vector so

509
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,690
understanding that process is critical

510
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,040
relevant initiatives in that space as

511
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,560
well include the Security Operations

512
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,810
Center and the sim initiative which are

513
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:26,090
really going to provide more data more

514
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,100
useful analytics to be able to better

515
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,300
understand what's happening on our

516
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,380
networks so I'll talk a little bit about

517
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,830
what the GC is doing slide builds there

518
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,530
we go so we have the digital Operations

519
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,260
strategic plan which is the the strategy

520
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,960
for the Government of Canada across all

521
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,080
of these different pillars I will say

522
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,690
service and user centric number one open

523
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,430
and collaborative accessible by design

524
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,890
digitally enabled delivery are the

525
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,020
pinnacle of what we are trying to

526
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,630
deliver to the end-user but how do we

527
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,510
enable that so we need modern technology

528
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,130
and information stewardship we need

529
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,320
digitally enabled public service and we

530
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,080
need good digital governance and to

531
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,730
support that modern technology we need

532
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,250
to be secure and trusted so we need to

533
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,930
build trusted access this is the

534
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,730
federated identity process both

535
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,160
internally for our GCC employees by

536
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,080
giving them true single sign-on across

537
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,410
the entire enterprise as well as access

538
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,850
for Canadians so they can access

539
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,760
services and not have to understand who

540
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,380
is delivering the service what the

541
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,600
organizational structures look like they

542
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,400
can access it with one identity in fact

543
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,660
they can access it with their provincial

544
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,940
identities or even their bank identities

545
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,640
this is an ability to provide more user

546
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,220
centric more user friendly services

547
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,350
while not compromising our security

548
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,640
protecting our assets so shifting to an

549
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,590
information cetera

550
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,169
centric security model to protect the

551
00:21:56,169 --> 00:21:58,659
data as the critical assets this is a

552
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:00,520
critical shift in the way we approach

553
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,070
security and is very very important to

554
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,880
understanding that we're protecting

555
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,789
what's actually important

556
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:13,150
we are owned by the people everything we

557
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,760
do is by the people so that's why we

558
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,380
have a tip that's why we have open and

559
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,140
transparent most of what we do is

560
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,529
actually discernible can be provided

561
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:25,510
through a tips can be provided on open

562
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,070
government so it's really understanding

563
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,409
what are those critical pieces that are

564
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:31,059
not subject to that and there are some

565
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,230
and there are some very important ones

566
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,330
we we protect the privacy of Canadians

567
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,059
we have national security these are all

568
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:38,740
critical pieces of information that we

569
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,909
have to make sure we are ever vigilant

570
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:42,640
of but if you can get rid of 90% of the

571
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,309
concerns by by identifying it as

572
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:47,350
low-risk and focusing on what is really

573
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,909
important you're going to be able to

574
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,350
focus your resources much more

575
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,580
effectively on what matters most and

576
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,049
then resilient services secure and

577
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:58,029
trusted digital services that require

578
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:00,000
systems and applications to be built

579
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,679
with resiliency and security by design

580
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:06,730
so you should be at the table on day 1

581
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,870
of the project not on day you know go

582
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,510
live - one it's necessary that we

583
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,940
consider security by design from the

584
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,010
beginning especially in a zero trust

585
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,200
model we're building in that security

586
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,960
capability the provisioning of user

587
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,179
roles directly into the functionality of

588
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:27,159
the application becomes critical to

589
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:33,789
providing that full security picture so

590
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:34,870
some of the key projects that we're

591
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,539
working on sign-in Canada which is the

592
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:40,210
means of giving every Canadian access to

593
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,390
government services as a platform but

594
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,370
more importantly it means that we break

595
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,460
down the silos between our organizations

596
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,830
Canadians can come in to Canada CA get

597
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:54,669
validated go from e SDC to CRA to vac -

598
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:56,799
I said and be able to move between those

599
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,809
systems without having to get

600
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:01,539
reallocated the tokens can get passed in

601
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:02,590
the backend that are thought

602
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,260
authentication P can be verified and we

603
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:08,230
can provide systems that allow for

604
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:12,039
increased verification when needed so if

605
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:13,720
you move from a system of low

606
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,299
authentication to one of high you can be

607
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:17,860
prompted for multi-factor authentication

608
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,500
as an example this is a way of providing

609
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,559
a much more user centric experience

610
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,850
actually increase the security posture

611
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,129
and make it invisible to users and

612
00:24:27,129 --> 00:24:31,240
easier for governments to implement GC

613
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,490
pass is the same concept but on the

614
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,799
inside so we're working very closely

615
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,889
with shared services Canada to provide a

616
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:40,539
federated identity model where we're

617
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:41,740
actually going to be able to have

618
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,360
systems that recognize that entities

619
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,549
between departments and the ability to

620
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:48,399
do multi-factor authentication to

621
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:51,340
increase our levels of assurances when

622
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,970
people are logging in administrative

623
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,769
access control services as well as an

624
00:24:56,769 --> 00:24:58,990
absolute critical piece that we're

625
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,700
working on because we know that these

626
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,820
are the administrative accounts held by

627
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,070
many of you I assume that are the most

628
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,139
vulnerable the accounts where if

629
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,120
compromised does take place the most

630
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,100
damage can get done there's always going

631
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,720
to be the need for the root account

632
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,919
there's always going to be the need for

633
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:17,230
the accounts that have very high level

634
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,210
of access to manage and monitor our

635
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,250
systems so we need to make sure we pay

636
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,929
particular attention to protecting those

637
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:25,389
and making sure that if there is a

638
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:27,309
compromise that we were able to segment

639
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:30,700
and minimize the loss neck work device

640
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,830
authentication so ensuring all GC

641
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,269
furnished equipment has a trusted device

642
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:36,490
certificate to enable network access

643
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,559
control this isn't just to provide

644
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,840
increased security internally but it

645
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,519
also provides better service to the

646
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:46,570
users by actually allowing a user in one

647
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,370
department to log on to a network in

648
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,500
another department and get access not to

649
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,090
that department's network but to my home

650
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,919
network so we can provide much more

651
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,740
flexibility and service with some of

652
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:00,190
these technologies endpoint visibility

653
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,809
to ensure that all of our assets are

654
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:04,149
visible we understand what the threat to

655
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:06,009
patching or lack thereof is to the

656
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:08,470
network and can react in a much more

657
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,360
specific way if we know where the

658
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,279
threats are secure cloud enablement and

659
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,990
defense this is making sure that we have

660
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:20,110
secure connectivity to the cloud for our

661
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,130
in

662
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,679
elzar protected me workloads this is

663
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,809
going to allow us to treat the cloud in

664
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:28,570
many instances as a virtual extension of

665
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,030
our networks and start to enable and

666
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,770
take advantage of some of the advanced

667
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,480
security models that are available in

668
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,240
the cloud if you're not familiar with

669
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,400
the AWS model I'd highly recommend you

670
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,140
take a look at it their entire

671
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,780
infrastructure the entire AWS cloud is

672
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,890
API driven everything can be automated

673
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,660
everything can be visible you can really

674
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,240
build a robust set of technologies that

675
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,340
monitors the activities and enables the

676
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,570
controls you need to protect that

677
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,730
environment and lastly the sim

678
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,020
redesigning our sim architecture to meet

679
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,700
enterprise security logging requirements

680
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,130
as a whole and providing services not

681
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:08,230
just to the security professionals but

682
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,450
to a more comprehensive set of users

683
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,740
that can start to understand the

684
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,059
activities that are taking place on our

685
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:18,429
network so what are the outcomes that

686
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:20,890
this is going to lead to true or

687
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,220
mobility the ability to log in and do

688
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,179
work from anywhere on any device is

689
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,799
really becoming a user expectation

690
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:32,500
everyone carries around a mobile

691
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,919
smartphone that gives you full access to

692
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,880
everything you need to do in your daily

693
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,590
lives why shouldn't that include your

694
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,919
work reducing the time to breach

695
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,720
detection so being much more flexible

696
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,000
much more nimble much more agile in

697
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,690
detection and reaction times reducing

698
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:52,630
the complexity trying to take down the

699
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,000
walls of all the firewalls and all the

700
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,400
the security controls that are a

701
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,820
nightmare to maintain and once breached

702
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,490
ineffective so by providing a more

703
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:06,880
granular micro perimeter model you're

704
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,860
going to be able to not only maintain

705
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,570
security posture but provide more

706
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:13,289
flexibility to your user community

707
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:15,429
greater security capacity through

708
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:17,740
consolidation again focusing on those

709
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,900
critical information assets and not

710
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,190
having to worry about the things that

711
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:24,309
are inconsequential adaptive security

712
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:26,679
based on context so auto provisioning

713
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:29,530
dynamic role provisioning and the

714
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,270
ability to react to the information

715
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,290
signals that you're getting on the

716
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,809
network and lastly the cost

717
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:36,850
to trust that the network is providing

718
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:40,090
the security we need at all times based

719
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:43,570
on the fact that it's called never trust

720
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:46,720
always verify so fundamentally we're

721
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,460
providing users the services they want

722
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,399
in the most efficient way possible while

723
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:54,990
providing the right security levels

724
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,159
commensurate to the current risk levels

725
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:59,230
so it's not about a one-size-fits-all

726
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,110
it's really about a at any given time

727
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,879
what are the security controls required

728
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:11,799
in the model so the GC is starting with

729
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:14,619
the building blocks now many stages are

730
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,990
information gathering planning piloting

731
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:20,860
working in agile fashion the time is now

732
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,389
to start coordinating resources and

733
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:23,919
plans to collectively approach this

734
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,110
change data breaches aren't going away

735
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,580
and the threat of cyber attacks are not

736
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,679
going to go down from a security

737
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,600
perspective zero trusts can better track

738
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,669
and block external attackers while

739
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:35,289
limiting security breaches resulting

740
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:37,869
from human error from a data sharing

741
00:29:37,869 --> 00:29:39,399
perspective zero trusts can better

742
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:41,320
manage rules for access for users and

743
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,080
devices across GC to facilitate secure

744
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,940
sharing from the enterprise while

745
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,360
providing better service to users

746
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,080
furthermore the network design and

747
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,299
flexibility of zero trust will help the

748
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:54,340
GC more rapidly adopt and implement

749
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,529
critical network technologies and enable

750
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:58,330
an enabler is ranging from cloud

751
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,490
computing to artificial intelligence and

752
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,340
machine learning and lastly we're here

753
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,619
to help so if you're looking at any of

754
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:06,909
these things and you want to consider

755
00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:09,369
them I'll introduce my team Imran Bashir

756
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:11,740
and poachy Duncan if you don't know them

757
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,320
they are here to engage in these

758
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,960
conversations and help you try to move

759
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,630
these things forward thank you very much

760
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,860
