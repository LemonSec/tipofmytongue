00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,299
[Music]

2
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:07,799
before my today's gonna be little bit

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:08,929
different that's what I'm gonna do is

4
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:11,070
we'll introduce kind of the topic from

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,719
an industry perspective now what we're

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:13,740
seeing from CrowdStrike

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,190
and I can only speak towards CrowdStrike

8
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,529
within our our company and I guess the

9
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:25,010
global global security calling

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,510
initiative whatever so when we see and

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,160
then we'll what I get is all introduce a

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,289
topic kind of talk towards it and really

13
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:32,729
what I wanted to have is have Caspian

14
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,649
here with me from an incident responses

15
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,809
how you know there's a reality about the

16
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:37,710
industry saying and then there's the

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,210
actual hard reality of what's happening

18
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,620
from an incident incident responders

19
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,530
find from that is talking from a

20
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,239
recovering sea so right so there's

21
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:46,590
there's a matter of fact or saying it

22
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,700
there's the guys on the front line

23
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,980
saying and then there's actual

24
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,090
executives and senior exactly the same

25
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,750
okay well this is my reality so we want

26
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,070
to leave it interactive we'll leave a

27
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,270
little bit more time at the end because

28
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,530
we really really like to get into a

29
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,940
conversation with the audience about

30
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,379
some of the challenges you guys have

31
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,840
right we can say we can talk about the

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,188
world or the reality of an 18-minute

33
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:07,260
breach and what that really means and

34
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,180
then we really kind of get down into the

35
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,580
nitty-gritty of real life what happens

36
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,970
every day

37
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,380
Green hey no there we go let's say the

38
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,460
game is afoot reality today is we have

39
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,079
to look at the attacker timeline so it's

40
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,170
not the same as it used to be way more

41
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,869
advanced way more tools you know you

42
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:40,409
basically have an Amazon service for an

43
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:41,670
attack right you can go out and just

44
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,860
pick whatever you want and you can

45
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,970
launch an attack anywhere from the world

46
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,890
you have nation-states everybody's

47
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,590
well-funded and they're tender and

48
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,090
they're their tactics or TTP's have

49
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,830
changed there's a fundamental basis to

50
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,360
how they do things but they change all

51
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,979
the time so how do you stay ahead of

52
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,270
that global breakout time as of last

53
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,240
year so December 2018 is an hour and 58

54
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,110
minutes so that's from an initial breach

55
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,729
to lateral move then they disappear

56
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,989
that's the global we'll get into

57
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:11,190
something a little bit different later

58
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,080
on as asked actual who's the best in the

59
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,580
world at doing this and what that really

60
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,090
means for for you guys and it's really

61
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,260
around the incident response timeline

62
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,489
right so with between detecting

63
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:22,230
understanding containing and eradicating

64
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,420
this you have an hour and 58 minutes and

65
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,430
I guess a question from us or for myself

66
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,310
and looking at the team is can anybody

67
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,769
effectively figure that out or you know

68
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:33,630
can you even find the problem within an

69
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,700
hour and 15 minutes global response time

70
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,769
just so you know it's 63 hours that's

71
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:40,470
the average to be able to remediate a

72
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,170
breach so when you're saying go ahead

73
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,600
Katzman uh well I mean for me the short

74
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,489
answer is no yeah you know it's it's

75
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:48,299
it's hard

76
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:50,130
I usually people aren't calling us

77
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,690
within the first one hour and 58 minutes

78
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,040
of a breach they've only gotten to the

79
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,680
point of discovery often after that red

80
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,780
marker objective has been hit and then

81
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,030
it's uh-oh this happened now what do we

82
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,769
do and that kind of leads you into a

83
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:02,700
different territory because you're

84
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,900
gathering evidence you're building a

85
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,100
forensic case and you have to be able to

86
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,569
you know go back to boards and

87
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:07,950
shareholders and your clients and often

88
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,930
say oh yeah this happens here's what

89
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,310
we're doing there are a lot of really

90
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,630
good examples on how to handle that I

91
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,310
can think of one from Montreal that was

92
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,269
fairly recent that you've all probably

93
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:22,319
seen in the news right perspective yeah

94
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,319
what I'd say is like any KPI it should

95
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,819
be a stretch objective is it achievable

96
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,599
today no but it's reality and tinea if

97
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,130
you

98
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,080
if you think about trying to like know

99
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,510
your adversary it's it's like a threat

100
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,070
performance indicator like if I was a

101
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,460
bad guy this is what how quickly I want

102
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,210
effectively I want to get into an

103
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,250
organization that not be detected cards

104
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,920
damaged and move laterally so from a

105
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,140
defender point of view of trying to stop

106
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,420
a bad guy that's the reality you've got

107
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,280
to try and stop whether or not your KPI

108
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,460
is achievable as a secondary question

109
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,500
perfect I actually kind of don't tells

110
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,780
him well into the well first of all goal

111
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,420
line wins I wanted to bring up can Kim

112
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,100
Jong Un's

113
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,600
five-year national plan and the reason

114
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,830
why is you know Carla kind of hit on

115
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,050
that is knowing who you're going up

116
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,740
against way I crouch like the way we see

117
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,110
it is the more intelligence you have the

118
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,790
more you understand about the adversary

119
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,950
the better prepared you are to get to

120
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,330
that call it one hour and 58 minutes his

121
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,860
address is addressed to the people this

122
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,260
year on January 1st was very different

123
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,400
than any other address he's ever done

124
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,350
and it was really around economic

125
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,480
development right the betterment of the

126
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,880
people of North Korea you know to

127
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,320
advance become leaders in the world and

128
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,050
technology

129
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,750
he mentioned economy 38 times and he's

130
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,030
never mentioned economy before ever in

131
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,010
any speech the reason why that's

132
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,740
important is you need to understand the

133
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,590
motivations of your attackers right so

134
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,080
at the surface looking at his speech it

135
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,110
sounds you know that's quite as what you

136
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,520
want your leader to do right focus on

137
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,650
the people focus on the economy but how

138
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,540
do you get that done when you're in a

139
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,760
repressive regime because that's amazing

140
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,410
propaganda probably the best in the

141
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,190
world

142
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,340
internally you have the sanctions you're

143
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,740
got the South Korea South Korea and

144
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,730
you've got everybody against you

145
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,650
globally how do you do it how does that

146
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,940
make sense how do you become an economic

147
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,030
leader how is it possible and why does

148
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:28,010
it matter so if you look at the Kalima

149
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,780
which is one of the threat actors that

150
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,210
we have and we call anyways we call the

151
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,620
spoiled child or burglar or part

152
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,850
military power he's really a dirty

153
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,490
pirate but is bad it's really they go on

154
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,100
a different way to get it they steal it

155
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,770
they're going to steal IP they're gonna

156
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,169
steal dollars

157
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:46,789
that's how it's very important to

158
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:49,669
understand their tactics when the Kalima

159
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:52,159
comes into your environment right it's a

160
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:55,159
nation state we had it recently with

161
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,319
Google there's another one that passed

162
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,909
so if you're in the Play Store

163
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:01,279
it's the fifth one in the last 18 months

164
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,840
of a valid app actually targeting

165
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,669
companies and end users from to steal

166
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:10,009
cash they pass through all the

167
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:13,460
certificates for Google Play Store and

168
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,289
just as a side note like we get a lot of

169
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:17,029
I do strategic consulting as well as I

170
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:19,009
our work and a lot of my clients would

171
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:20,300
always ask the same question when we

172
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,349
were talking about stuff like this well

173
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:22,610
what do I have that they could possibly

174
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,710
want you know and it's kind of a oh well

175
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,669
they're gonna come in and steal my

176
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:27,289
passport information no no no they're

177
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:28,879
there to get money that's what they're

178
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,189
after and a lot of times when you frame

179
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:32,360
it is what do I have that they could why

180
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,279
you're not really thinking about the

181
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,319
defensive parts of this because what you

182
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,819
have may not necessarily be the same

183
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:40,310
target that they're after but it still

184
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,210
puts you in a position where you're

185
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,499
being breached it doesn't matter what

186
00:06:42,499 --> 00:07:02,270
you have you know your enemy know

187
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,639
thyself especially know your network

188
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,529
because there's an asymmetric advantage

189
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:09,319
of the bad guy and understanding sort of

190
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:12,169
kind of the where John is getting at

191
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:13,939
here is not just who the threat is and

192
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:16,279
what their techniques and practices are

193
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,620
but it's what's their motivation so

194
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,599
doing threat assessments and

195
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:22,399
understanding why what are your crown

196
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,259
jewels and why are people after you and

197
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:27,770
what's their intent is as important as

198
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,589
sort of the kind of generic best

199
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:32,779
practices of security yeah the intent is

200
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:34,129
a big one because you can defend against

201
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:36,169
intent you can't defend against some

202
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:39,439
unknown cloud adversary who is just you

203
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,300
know amorphous once you know what

204
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,860
they're after though it doesn't matter

205
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,120
if it's something that you think is

206
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,599
important you can defend against that

207
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,560
correct and then we'll end off with the

208
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,389
Moses principles of Juche a which is

209
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:53,080
basically independence right so being

210
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,389
economically independent and military

211
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:56,750
that's

212
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,480
the model of of North Korea and when we

213
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,070
go back on the prop again I mean they're

214
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,660
very good considering that their

215
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,830
national animal is a Pegasus and

216
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,820
everybody believes that they exist so

217
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,520
anyways moving on I want to leave this

218
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,170
slide up here this is the big one this

219
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,090
is the breakout times and this comes as

220
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:19,130
of March 2019 and if you actually look

221
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,960
at that Russia's by far the leader in

222
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,520
the world it takes some 18 minutes to

223
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,470
bust in and move laterally and they're

224
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,570
gone in your environment can you even

225
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,430
detect that they're there within 18

226
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,740
minutes let's be honest we get asked

227
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,380
that a lot actually you know and the

228
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,169
truth is yeah you can you probably can

229
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,549
you're not gonna see it in the 18

230
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,630
minutes that they were there you're

231
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,150
gonna see it after the fact when you get

232
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,979
called by someone else and they say hey

233
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:44,270
we found your information on the

234
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,450
Internet you know when your ADR systems

235
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,920
actually report that there's evidence of

236
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,630
lateral movement you're finding this out

237
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,580
so that 18 minutes right there and this

238
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,320
is unfortunately kind of a theme that I

239
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,490
keep going back to with a lot of this

240
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,830
stuff is that is it's it is a good goal

241
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,300
it's a good idea to actually be able to

242
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,740
be able to be able to get to a point

243
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,270
where you can detect that but most

244
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,200
people aren't going to be able to

245
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,810
immediately and there's another thing

246
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,860
about this and this is always something

247
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,089
that we kind of like joking about like

248
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,080
if they're that good they won't get

249
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,850
detected well there's your answer right

250
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,080
there they are that good and sometimes

251
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:21,530
they don't you know I guess I agree with

252
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,470
that on the breakout times and the

253
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,910
understanding that the Russians are

254
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:30,850
saying more superior back to the threat

255
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,470
assessment of who's after you so I don't

256
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,990
have to solve all the animal process I

257
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,360
just have to figure out in my company

258
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,700
which ones after me with what intent so

259
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,080
like I'm not wide I'm narrowing deep on

260
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,580
figuring out okay that it's that

261
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,100
particular threat whether it's a panda

262
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,990
or a spider or whatever and I need to

263
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,089
focus on their techniques I don't have

264
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:55,490
to almost like The MITRE attack vector I

265
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,560
need to focus on the most probable use

266
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,780
cases and work on those yes all these

267
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,670
other people could attack me but let's

268
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,740
talk about the most likely one and try

269
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,080
and stop that the second part I would

270
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,460
say is what used to be like kind of the

271
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,340
national threat scaling down to like the

272
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,850
anonymous anonymize and you know script

273
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,170
Katy was that the the apt had different

274
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,420
you know advanced skills and and access

275
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,400
and persistence those days are kind of

276
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,320
over and if you think of kind of like

277
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,510
the NSA power tools kind of got out in

278
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,640
the wild so for two hundred bucks a

279
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,590
script Katie and in his mom's basement

280
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,770
can get access to those weapons so again

281
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,690
I go back to intent oh why someone wants

282
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,770
to come at you and and looking at that

283
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,420
vector a little more than all the all

284
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,490
the animals that's and that's a good

285
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,380
point right so we put that up there you

286
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,820
know that's kind of the benchmark of

287
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,960
what's going on and you got to realize

288
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,220
that Russia that eighty minutes that's a

289
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,320
targeted attack right so that's very

290
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,340
specific to somebody so it could be an

291
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,290
energy organization that's what you know

292
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,000
I've seen this over the last two years

293
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,310
that I've been that CrowdStrike you know

294
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,810
you have they have multiple affiliates

295
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,700
globally they're in competition all the

296
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,210
time

297
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,090
to overtake other organizations and

298
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,110
there's been a few of them that they

299
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,340
have targeted a tax base so it's

300
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,930
basically on them and it turns out it

301
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,140
ends up being the Secretary to the VP of

302
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,850
mergers and acquisitions that gets

303
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,870
targeted why is that

304
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,860
and it's China I mean so it's you got to

305
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,150
put the way to the contacts and that's

306
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,980
where the intelligence has to come into

307
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,390
this to understand why are they doing

308
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,650
that why was that person attacked yeah I

309
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,790
was gonna say I think historically I

310
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,860
mean to dovetail that we spend a lot of

311
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,180
time talking about stuff like threat

312
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,500
intelligence and the sort of stuff and

313
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,880
and I've been doing security for about

314
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,200
twenty years I may not look like I'm

315
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,300
that old but thanks and one of the

316
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,350
things that when this stuff came out

317
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,060
initially everyone kind of went now come

318
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,650
on you know this is we're not in an

319
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,120
action film we're not all James Bond

320
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,230
here we're not fighting international

321
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,450
spies yes that is true we are not

322
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,030
however these are still things that

323
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,410
happen these are still parts of the

324
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,610
reality that we're gonna have to deal

325
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,830
with as people who are doing security in

326
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,090
this world because everything is

327
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,520
connected and realistically if it's

328
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,650
economically easy for a state actor or

329
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,360
pretty much anybody else and my favorite

330
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,800
one here is the spider at the bottom eek

331
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,720
rhyme because that can literally be

332
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,610
anybody like we we track our threat

333
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,780
actors or CrowdStrike and we actually

334
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,430
see these guys and some of us have

335
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,080
gotten to the point handling these cases

336
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,150
where we might even know the individual

337
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,019
behind it we're never

338
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,220
gonna be able to attribute it back to

339
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,569
that one person but it's kind of like

340
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:25,829
you've developed a signature for this

341
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,239
person here's like oh yeah here he comes

342
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:28,920
again like this there's that one guy and

343
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,540
you know his mom's basement in Georgia

344
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,579
who is just going ahead and putting out

345
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,709
that malware and surprise we've got

346
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,259
another case so for me it's it's yeah

347
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:38,699
get to know your threat actors get to

348
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:40,319
know these groups and yes this does

349
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,610
sound a little bit militaristic and a

350
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,049
little bit like a James Bond we that

351
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:44,699
makes it fun it doesn't mean that you're

352
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:47,759
chasing spies all day that's all yeah I

353
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,809
want to echo uh Noddy

354
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,269
it's back to intent right the II crime

355
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:53,759
people are more of a mercantile group

356
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,319
and they do it's not personal its

357
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:57,799
business right so you you can't really

358
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:00,360
if you picked a threat beat the Russians

359
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,629
or the Chinese you still have this other

360
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:05,489
orthogonal approach it just says anyone

361
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:07,470
can if if anyone wants to get at you

362
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,899
they go through kind of the hitman

363
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,790
approach right yeah it's like I say

364
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,199
they're not they don't have intent

365
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:15,059
they're just mercenary and I was

366
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:16,829
watching one of these our presentation

367
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,230
at another seminar last week and one of

368
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,639
our threat intelligence experts he

369
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,019
focused in on to your point to the e

370
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,689
crime and I asked him after cuz I have

371
00:13:24,689 --> 00:13:25,769
to go back in and out and I said well

372
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:27,689
why'd you focus area says well it was

373
00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:29,160
Russians North Koreans in China and

374
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,509
around they're usually targeted attacks

375
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,949
he says the e crime is interesting

376
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:34,019
because yes this has 9 hours and 42

377
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,220
minutes but you got to realize that's a

378
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,769
global deployment that's not a target

379
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:39,600
attack so that number is more impressive

380
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,079
to me than a Russian 18 minute that's

381
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,759
millions and millions of endpoints being

382
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:47,610
affected in under under 10 hours so just

383
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,079
food for thought it's kind of

384
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,749
spectacular really yeah it's just just

385
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,490
one more comment there the last time

386
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,499
CrowdStrike profiled me I think I came

387
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:57,119
out on the weasel food chain I thought

388
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:05,279
er so what does that mean so yeah so

389
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,709
viral the fastest 11060 roll and this is

390
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:08,579
kind of how CrowdStrike

391
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:11,100
benchmarks it internally for us so it's

392
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,860
basically one minute to detect 10

393
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,360
minutes to investigate the showing yet

394
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,819
is and then 60 minutes in order to

395
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:19,529
remediate contain a remediate this this

396
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:21,269
problem then this is the leading

397
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:23,489
organizations in the world strive for

398
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:26,129
this and it's a constant challenge I

399
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:28,919
don't know and Caspian can't possibly

400
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,240
talk a little bit more about this but

401
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,410
for me I don't know I don't know if

402
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,419
we've actually seen any organization get

403
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:34,070
there

404
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,510
yet or they have been there but they

405
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,450
can't maintain it it's a lot I seen

406
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,640
organizations to get close and I think

407
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,870
maybe there's some people in this room

408
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,530
that work for some of these

409
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:45,680
organizations but I the thing is that

410
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,260
it's not a consistent thing because just

411
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,930
the time to detection isn't gonna be one

412
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,820
minute for all cases you know time to

413
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,200
investigate that's gonna depend on what

414
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,640
you've got in terms of available people

415
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,560
to actually investigate especially if

416
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,670
you're dealing with multiple incidents

417
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,920
which most people are you know you're

418
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,260
not gonna be running one ir1 detection

419
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,640
you've got all this stuff that's coming

420
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,960
in across your networks because your

421
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,370
networks are large and you have massive

422
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,010
footprints so your time to investigate

423
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,450
is gonna be dependent on the work forces

424
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,350
available it turns into a project

425
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,510
management problem not a hard security

426
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,400
problem but project management becomes a

427
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,450
hard security problem when you don't

428
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,190
have enough people available and then

429
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,420
time to remediate it's the same thing

430
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,740
you have the expertise on-site do you

431
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,750
have the people there you know and this

432
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,200
is where yeah 11060 that's an ideal goal

433
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,640
to strive for that is that is like

434
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,410
cleanliness next to godliness if you

435
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,340
want to if you want to put it in that

436
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,610
direction but there is a lot more going

437
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,220
on there that has to be focused on and a

438
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,510
lot of that goes outside of the IR

439
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,960
process too right so what I would say

440
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,510
about the one 1060 thing is the one I as

441
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,850
a C so it's trying to keep his job for

442
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:52,370
more than 18 months which is it's the 60

443
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,510
right so do I care that I detect people

444
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,460
infecting me in one minute would be nice

445
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,220
but the one that's the killer is the the

446
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,860
60 because what you find is your current

447
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,380
state systems and the people thereof are

448
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,470
very it's not yet real time and not you

449
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,680
know fully continuous monitoring nor

450
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,420
it's very hierarchical in terms of

451
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,100
moving logs up through defense and death

452
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,590
and and through people in tears it's

453
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:22,130
very linear in terms of most

454
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,170
investigation very nonlinear your going

455
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,410
on in very different direction so to

456
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,270
kind of go from current state to future

457
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:34,250
state and hit 60 minutes to prevent lack

458
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,290
of a better term you need to do three

459
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,000
things in my opinion one is start to

460
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,920
prioritize you can't go after everything

461
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,950
and every log number two is settle for

462
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,600
resilience yeah people are getting in

463
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,830
but so what let's just talk

464
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,680
the ones that are moving fast laterally

465
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,970
and the third thing is innovation right

466
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,400
you're not gonna use old tried and true

467
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,230
techniques you're gonna have to go

468
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,560
analytics and AI and and whatever right

469
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,390
and the second problem with that is soar

470
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,910
the bad guys right yeah you're into a

471
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,630
different kind of space race it's I feel

472
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,310
like I mean I used to describe this to

473
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,470
actually a lot of people you know

474
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,329
because we all have family that oh you

475
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:13,560
work in security can you tell me about

476
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,270
the latest malware well yeah malware's

477
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,310
like the arms race was you know there's

478
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,599
always gonna be somebody out there who's

479
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,709
doing something it's slightly better

480
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:23,670
weirder worse whatever and inevitably I

481
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,109
think you know I'm with you on that like

482
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,700
it's it's the 60 minutes that actually

483
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,680
count but one in the 10 are a big deal

484
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,900
and I can tell you from experience we

485
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,400
never get a call in the first 10 minutes

486
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,650
it's that next 60 that's gonna make the

487
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,060
difference as to whether or not we can

488
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,980
even I mean from our end it's gonna make

489
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,150
the difference besides to whether or not

490
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,140
we're gonna be able to help you out

491
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,820
immediately and contain things or it's

492
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,500
gonna turn into a longer investigation -

493
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:55,650
yeah yeah this is John's really quiet

494
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,880
and he's off mic but he basically said

495
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,120
sorry this is where the intelligence

496
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,080
comes this is where the intelligence

497
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,610
comes in yeah just understanding your

498
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,290
adversary really really knowing who

499
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,760
you're dealing with and their tactics

500
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,380
right so we'll talk about in another

501
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,950
slide but TTP's will change dilmer

502
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,510
they'll evolve over time but the

503
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,890
fundamentals of how they do things

504
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:23,370
remain the same through that this is an

505
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,750
interesting one so I guess for a good

506
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,520
prevention or policy I guess internally

507
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,760
is really having to feed your

508
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,260
stakeholders but you need to identify

509
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,170
who those stakeholders are right and so

510
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,000
no get Karl specifically the start on

511
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,860
this one but from a tactical perspective

512
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,590
from an operational perspective and then

513
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,410
strategic what does that mean to a see

514
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,020
so and then transversely what does it

515
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,050
mean on as far as an inside you know

516
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,640
incident or so yeah yeah yeah

517
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,650
so I'll start in the top floor I think

518
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,590
the big thing

519
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,340
the tools and the new approach can

520
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,720
change is kind of what I would call a

521
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,690
silos so you have a really good team

522
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,870
environment in a large security sauk or

523
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:12,170
as I see so even but everyone's in their

524
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,640
funnels right the IR people and the

525
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,860
governance response people and the

526
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,810
isinglass people they tend to they have

527
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,910
a silo and they're good at it but the

528
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,760
crosstalk isn't there and so if you look

529
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,800
at how they've laid out the tactical and

530
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,480
operational and strategic teams

531
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,910
it's compensating for that saying we you

532
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,710
should have one of every type of person

533
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,870
a psycho hacker get them all in a room

534
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,670
and start to compare notes and and now

535
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,520
you're as opposed to like building a big

536
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,620
data Lake and and kind of getting all

537
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,520
the logs and and working the data you're

538
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,320
working the insight so I want to know

539
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,840
you guys in you Ebola and look and you

540
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,450
guys in EDR look bad stuff and you came

541
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,220
up with an idea or an insight

542
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,930
well now let's start sharing insights as

543
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,330
a cross-functional team and and I'd add

544
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,070
there's still a north/south problem not

545
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,590
not a network one but a organizational

546
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,600
one where okay the IR people are down

547
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,250
there doing all that and the seaso kind

548
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,110
of shows up in a suit and pops you in

549
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,300
and buy some coffee and how's everybody

550
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:08,870
doing all right

551
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,270
great yeah keep keep help the problem

552
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,220
solved yeah okay good you know and send

553
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,750
me the kind of pie chart with the risk

554
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,970
analysis yeah root cause analysis I'll

555
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,830
go back up to the top floor and explain

556
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,840
to them what's going on yeah well no you

557
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,490
got to get in the same situation room

558
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,760
and start yes outwardly focus and talk

559
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,610
to vendors and talk talk upstairs but be

560
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,220
part of that team you know sort of top

561
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,920
floor to shop floor do you remember the

562
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,260
a-team you know that the show I pity the

563
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,900
fool yeah this the seaso is the face man

564
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,730
to me you know when when we're doing

565
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,350
this we there's got to be somebody out

566
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,820
front I mean maybe he's the guy with a

567
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,680
cigar whose name I can't remember but

568
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,550
George Peppard

569
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,620
George Peppard yeah but there's always

570
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,030
got to be somebody there who's actually

571
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,640
not only coordinating things in that

572
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,320
sense and talking to management talking

573
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,220
to the board and talking to the people

574
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,720
that need to be talked to but also

575
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,220
shilling the team so they get their work

576
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,600
done and bridging all these gaps

577
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,220
sometimes that's two people sometimes

578
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,640
it's three frequently it's just one

579
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,050
that's a lot of work I love it when a

580
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,140
plan comes together

581
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,880
from kind of this side in this slide

582
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,559
side

583
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:15,340
you know I don't just do IR obviously

584
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,990
I've done a lot of proactive consulting

585
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,120
with people and when we look at silos

586
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,950
and I'm glad you use that phrase because

587
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,870
it's actually one that I love if you've

588
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,850
ever looked at a grain silo they're very

589
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,139
hard to destroy a little bit of trivia

590
00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:28,179
for you it takes a lot of explosives to

591
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:31,149
take down a grain silo and I live in

592
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:32,529
Montreal we actually have a whole bunch

593
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:33,759
of them around the city that we can't

594
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,220
take out and one of the things about

595
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,259
that is yes they're beautiful but if

596
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:40,269
you're inside one very little actually

597
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:41,830
gets out of that silo until it rises to

598
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,269
the top goes across and then comes down

599
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:44,710
the next side or you feed it from the

600
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,529
bottom and a lot of what I've seen work

601
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:49,539
well for people is when they've got that

602
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:51,490
crosstalk going on at all levels and

603
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,720
it's not you've got to report up through

604
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,429
the chain of command yeah yeah we have

605
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:55,629
processes for that and those are

606
00:21:55,629 --> 00:21:56,769
important and from my end they're

607
00:21:56,769 --> 00:21:58,029
extremely important because then I can

608
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:00,580
see that information feeding in but it's

609
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,570
also important that everyone's actually

610
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,610
properly communicating and frequently I

611
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,740
find what holds up a lot of our incident

612
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,999
responses is that we don't have that

613
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:08,590
communication there's stuff that was

614
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,600
just never brought to the table you know

615
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,730
earlier on in the response process that

616
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,869
should have been that comes out later on

617
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:16,299
and we're like oh well I mean you had

618
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:17,740
that technology there all along why

619
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,700
didn't we just lever it than the

620
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,990
leverage in the first ten minutes

621
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,330
instead of spending five weeks chasing

622
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,269
after this other thing so there's

623
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:27,700
elements of this where unifying tactical

624
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,929
operational a strategic are actually a

625
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:31,330
really big deal for me because I'm often

626
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,519
going to be the one person on the phone

627
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,590
with one person who has to have all that

628
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,299
information and feed it back to us I

629
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:39,249
think the other thing is that on the

630
00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:40,720
cross-functional teams is it goes from

631
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,249
bad to worse right we're talking about

632
00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:45,519
cyber security sauk what's happening it

633
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:47,799
was is okay this is that that's changing

634
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,299
but there's kind of a perfect storm and

635
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:52,419
Technology around kiddos IOT there's

636
00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:55,629
cloud there's AI and you're starting to

637
00:22:55,629 --> 00:22:58,090
say ok there's a sock thing that we all

638
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,559
got to get out of silos but what about

639
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:01,090
the NOC and what about all these other

640
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,679
things that are traditionally not

641
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:05,590
security and yet the problem can start

642
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,119
out as a performance issue and then

643
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,369
migrate over to a security issue and

644
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:11,499
it's kind of that cross-functional team

645
00:23:11,499 --> 00:23:13,659
is there's not a leader it's more like

646
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,669
you said a school of fish that someone's

647
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:17,799
detected something and they've seem to

648
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:20,350
be running with a good idea and you go

649
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,389
nope and if someone else is taking over

650
00:23:22,389 --> 00:23:24,220
so it's not just this

651
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,309
dirty silo we used to joke Joe's here

652
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:29,110
from the the Bell sock but we used to

653
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,730
call it the stock right it's you can't

654
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,510
just have a knock and a sock serf one

655
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,580
across yeah you're going back and forth

656
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,039
on a problem to see is it just a

657
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,200
performance issue or a capacity issue or

658
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,419
is it a related DDoS attack that kind of

659
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:46,150
stuff one of my prior employers actually

660
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:49,150
had we was at the time it was a while

661
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,409
ago we didn't we didn't really have a

662
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:51,700
full security department we didn't have

663
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,620
an IR team we had a bunch of really

664
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,419
talented system ins couple of helpdesk

665
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:56,860
folks and one or two other people who

666
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,840
knew what they were doing and like doing

667
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,179
security and that was who it was and I

668
00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:02,620
used to joke that it was like you know

669
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,630
their vir posse because you only call

670
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,669
them up when you need them i when i was

671
00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:07,960
doing strategic consulting and when i

672
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,309
still do this i refer to this as the

673
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:10,890
volunteer fire department problem

674
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,520
because frankly you're gonna be

675
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,570
attracting the people who want to do

676
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,010
security and you'll get people who

677
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,990
should be doing it and frequently i see

678
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,640
this son especially like i don't want to

679
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,080
pick on web devs but i see that a lot on

680
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,140
the dev side where it's a no that's not

681
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,510
my job well yeah it's not but it's also

682
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,220
your job to make a product that works or

683
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,870
you know build a thing that is secure so

684
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,250
yes it is your job and you're you're

685
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,360
coming with me right now and you should

686
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,110
come with me

687
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,909
even if you don't want to trust me it'll

688
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:36,159
be fun but I think part of the problem

689
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,570
is also getting that involvement from

690
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,039
people you know you can't make it look

691
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,720
like what you're doing is a scary black

692
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,220
art you're a wizard you have to actually

693
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,039
bring them to the party basically

694
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,570
volunteer fireman number one person

695
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:51,850
starting fires I guarantee you got work

696
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:56,169
you know nice and really moving into

697
00:24:56,169 --> 00:24:58,000
moving from reactive proactive I think

698
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,990
we kind of touched a little bit on this

699
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,809
but we you know and off we don't another

700
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:03,159
five minutes and we kind of want to open

701
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:04,919
that up for the crowd but really it's

702
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,840
and what what I've come together and and

703
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,130
and and everything we I've heard today

704
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,650
and from every other conference and

705
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,390
white paper that I've read is really

706
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,440
yeah you have to enrich everything

707
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,450
because context is king data is king

708
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,450
right so without it it's perfect perfect

709
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,000
I won the one minute might work to your

710
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,210
point right the 10 maybe 60 not so much

711
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,919
you really have to understand what's

712
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:27,940
going on you got to have that

713
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,669
information

714
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:31,539
behind every intrusion there's a

715
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:33,010
collection requirement understand this

716
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,600
and get the resources to build the

717
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,460
correct wall right

718
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,740
and I so it always goes back to

719
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,430
intelligence it always goes back to

720
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,920
understanding that adversary who's there

721
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,630
why are there what's the motivation

722
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:46,090
behind it it's not don't always take it

723
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,160
face value got a dig yeah but you got to

724
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,840
have that information this is this is a

725
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,720
really big one for me because I had an

726
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,820
old colleague who after I give this nice

727
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,410
talk about all this stuff and I was kind

728
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,610
of like yeah you know you can do this

729
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:00,250
it's great she just she was actually I'm

730
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,020
seeing this thing I was a big client

731
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,060
event and she's like well well Caspian

732
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,140
you know the problem is that none of our

733
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,550
clients have a money tree growing in

734
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,770
their backyard and they can't just

735
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,240
defend against everything and the truth

736
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,130
is you can but a lot of times when you

737
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,720
approach security especially as a new

738
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,860
security person or even when you've been

739
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,600
doing it forever we all fall prey to

740
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,280
this trap of like oh yeah I know

741
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,690
everything is on fire we have to block

742
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,480
all of the holes in the dike no it's

743
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,160
actually important to prioritize and

744
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,540
it's important to figure out what the

745
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,430
context is and you know what the threats

746
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:31,930
are you know I more say in elastic

747
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,940
sandbox in a wall it's kind of again but

748
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:39,490
don't break I think for a sea so -

749
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:42,460
you're back to your point on on ROI up

750
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,960
till now it's always been give me the

751
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,420
money I'll secure things now it's more

752
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,820
be a business enabler so we can't do

753
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,340
everything I really want to understand

754
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,750
the value for money of adding these

755
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,940
additional walls or whatnot and that's

756
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,520
that's the new reality in terms of like

757
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,810
you said you're not gonna stop

758
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,310
everything you've just admitted that

759
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:03,370
number two is we have a spend that the

760
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,280
money could go to security or go to

761
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,780
cloud or go to many other things in this

762
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,480
company so explain to me why the next

763
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,890
dollar should go here and why it's the

764
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,450
best bad yeah oh you're getting into

765
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,900
prioritization and you're getting into

766
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,760
where the CSO is not a lone wolf anymore

767
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,680
he's got a deal he or she's got to deal

768
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,450
with the entire board they're liable

769
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,420
there's other you know there's CFOs and

770
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,250
CIOs and now you're gonna have to work

771
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,870
across the c-level sweet absolutely I

772
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,620
said it before I'll say it again

773
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,110
adversaries changed and adapt TTP's but

774
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,120
there's still a fundamental consistency

775
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,890
and what they do right so that's that's

776
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,110
key you just got to be I you know it's

777
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,640
getting things like get that important

778
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,900
intelligence as to what they're doing

779
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,820
now but the motivations are always the

780
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,460
same so so he's hit upon a spot I

781
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,840
I come out of the insider threat you

782
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,549
weeba area and basically the message is

783
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:53,690
you can't talk yourself out of a

784
00:27:53,690 --> 00:28:07,399
behavior right so yeah what's the

785
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:09,140
difference between a serial entrepreneur

786
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,960
and a serial killer

787
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,700
couple of letters serial killer doesn't

788
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:21,380
count as attempted murders like like my

789
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,860
point there is just that even the

790
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,529
hackers not aware of these TTP's like if

791
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:28,940
he's smart you'd read zone scouting

792
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,549
report and go this is what you do so you

793
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:34,250
you're much more able to detect quicker

794
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,500
faster in my opinion around behavioral

795
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,909
analytics and you are anything else

796
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:40,399
about who the bad guy is what's he doing

797
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,710
what's gonna do next because you do kind

798
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,350
of know that bad guys always have to end

799
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,909
up in the worst place possible for them

800
00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:48,320
right they want to get the crown jewels

801
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,289
they want to no matter what bad things

802
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:52,880
you put in place to deter them they're

803
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,919
gonna take the risk so you can start to

804
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:58,309
through TTP start to look for towels and

805
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:00,529
also you know what they're going correct

806
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:02,840
yeah and doing the attack tribution is

807
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,130
you know we talked about doing

808
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,140
attribution and there's you have to take

809
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:10,580
that with a but yeah right so just

810
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,679
because the TTP s are correct and and

811
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:13,940
you know like you said it's always about

812
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,409
the motivation and understanding kind of

813
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:16,610
what the endgame is and going out to

814
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:18,820
crown jewels but it's very easy for an

815
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,440
assumption to be made that it's Russia

816
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,240
coming after you when a back door you

817
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,860
realize it ends up being North Korea or

818
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,360
or somebody else right so you got to

819
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,559
keep that in mind as well right and

820
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:28,909
that's where all that information best

821
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:30,770
practice and working with your people

822
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,230
right I think I find this the

823
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,640
attribution side kind of interesting cuz

824
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,990
I remember I don't know if anyone

825
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,640
remembers sectaurs attribution dice that

826
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,600
they were handing out when your as

827
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,789
conference swag people do you know and

828
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:45,529
I'm like I'll make wisecracks about this

829
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:48,140
all the time the truth is that while

830
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,820
it's important to know what you're

831
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,110
defending against and who you're

832
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,909
defending against ultimately when they

833
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:54,620
get in and start doing things it doesn't

834
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,419
matter who they were they are doing

835
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,100
things now and you need to make it stop

836
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,320
so the attribution part is great that

837
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,450
can come later knowing what your threats

838
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:02,870
are for

839
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,280
knowing the threat environment knowing

840
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,170
the TTP's we're gonna use that

841
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,900
three-letter acronym but the tactics

842
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,820
techniques procedures you know what

843
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,380
color shoes they wear is maybe not as

844
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,059
important but getting to know those

845
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:16,130
threat actors down to a point where you

846
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,960
can actually say yeah they usually do

847
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,260
this great attribution afterwards well

848
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,700
you know it gives you a nice pat on the

849
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,260
back it's kind of fun for the story but

850
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,470
it's not a hundred yeah it's a thing

851
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,480
yeah we did the right process and the

852
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,920
piece we follow the right procedures to

853
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,800
identify that yeah or know that I think

854
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,540
that's well put it's not a keep your eye

855
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,940
it's not a one yeah ten sixty you find

856
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,830
out who the attribution is assigned to

857
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,590
so what it's important to understand who

858
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,170
your adversary is and why it's not on a

859
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,840
time line yeah and and it's there's no

860
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,940
retaliation there's no you're trying to

861
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,220
remediate we're not the police we're not

862
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,880
the government well okay some of you are

863
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,610
but that the point is like unless you're

864
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,960
handing this over to law enforcement

865
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,309
unless legals involved in a way where

866
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:02,720
it's actually necessary most of the time

867
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,520
yeah it's it's handy but it's not a KPI

868
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,860
yeah an analysis of the Silver Bullet

869
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,350
bullet is people and I'll leave it at

870
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,940
that well so you don't affect the

871
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,380
defense we talked about that but people

872
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,890
are also your biggest move called risk

873
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,390
right so we're gonna be your biggest

874
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,860
asset but your biggest risk your biggest

875
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,990
exposure right so I think we've all seen

876
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,670
that they have a separate talk I do

877
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,620
about this once in a while where I talk

878
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,820
about doing security and effectively

879
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,470
fundamentally all security does matter

880
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,690
if it's cybersecurity or you know day

881
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,950
care security you're always defending

882
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,200
people in the end yeah because you can

883
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,490
talk about data you can talk about your

884
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,690
crown jewels in your assets but

885
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,040
fundamentally those are always going to

886
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,660
be attached to a human being at the end

887
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,790
of the day it may be a client it may be

888
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,990
your board it may be your shareholders

889
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:45,230
it may be you but the fact is yes it's

890
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,929
people it always comes down to people

891
00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:50,150
yeah I'd agree and and I also think it's

892
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:53,270
yes to skilled people in security that

893
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:56,240
you need to better equip and they're on

894
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,650
point for security I think kind of the

895
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,750
security awareness and and the not the

896
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,460
lack of recognition that people are also

897
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,860
your weakest layer that's always going

898
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,220
to happen with social networking and

899
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,520
social engineering sorry for teen slope

900
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:14,110
I think in a business context of your

901
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,789
the seaso you start to realize that you

902
00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:17,679
know the CIO and a CFO and all their

903
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,450
people they have other jobs you know if

904
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,640
finance and productivity and you name it

905
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,260
you're this security guy at the other

906
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,240
day and that's why you're on point for a

907
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,100
breach so expecting the rest of the

908
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,870
organization to make security first

909
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,280
that's not their day job

910
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,409
so you have to figure out ways to enable

911
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,299
them to do their job and yet be secure

912
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:37,090
to your point think of them as people

913
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,740
you need to safeguard not people that

914
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,650
are the problem yeah yeah and that's

915
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:44,880
yeah that's that's my kind of big one

916
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,530
remember people that would be number two

917
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,159
on my list

918
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,480
people data yeah right there that's kind

919
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,830
of it for our talk tracks we want to

920
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,390
kind of open up the the floor if you

921
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,140
guys have any questions

922
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,379
you
