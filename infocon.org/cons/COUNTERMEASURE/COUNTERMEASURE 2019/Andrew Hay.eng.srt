2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,960
my name is Andrew hey just briefly about

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,719
me and I'm going to apologize to the guy

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,880
doing the camera cuz I I'm just gonna do

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,430
this the whole time and avoid it so I'm

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,150
the CEO at Lara's I've been in InfoSec

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,199
for close to 25 years various roles and

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,599
responsibilities lived and worked in

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,640
Bermuda I'm actually I grew up in Ottawa

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,260
I'm from Halifax originally but I grew

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,260
up here in Ottawa went to Lisgar just

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,850
across the canal played rugby here for a

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,600
number of unsuccessful years and moved

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,680
to the States

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,770
because that's where all the money is so

16
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,789
one of the things that I do in my spare

17
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,510
time is I coach rugby because I made the

18
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,610
one mistake of bringing my wife with me

19
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,579
to the doctor's office when I had to

20
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,850
have an x-ray of my back and to ask him

21
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,680
you know how long was it going to be

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,510
before I played rugby again and his

23
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,489
response was ho oh you're not playing

24
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,640
rugby ever again like oh probably I

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,260
brought my wife into the room for that

26
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,580
diagnosis so I've also written three

27
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,170
books four books that you've never read

28
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,240
but that's fine and I blog very

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,330
infrequently but what I wanted to talk

30
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,240
about in this session is I've been a C

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,070
so for a number of years I've been a

32
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,380
security executive at various different

33
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,960
companies different roles

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,640
responsibilities and I've noticed that

35
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,490
we as individuals we tend to switch our

36
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,970
view on how to instruct or teach someone

37
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,659
something so who here has young kids or

38
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,049
has ever had young kids I can't pick on

39
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,820
either YouTube you guys won't give me

40
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,740
the good answers who says they have kids

41
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,579
over here you sir how old are your kids

42
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,100
alright as the four year old been

43
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,320
involved in any sports at all organised

44
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,370
sports all right what about kicking a

45
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,910
soccer ball back

46
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,870
and forth alright so the first time you

47
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,480
did that I'm going to just make an

48
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,000
assumption that they either missed it

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,120
completely and fell on their back or got

50
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,860
hit in the face based on every YouTube

51
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,350
video I've ever seen

52
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,200
started crying now there's probably you

53
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,820
know that may or may not be correct but

54
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,350
for the sake of this conversation let's

55
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,180
say that that's exactly what happened is

56
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,190
one of those two things there's two ways

57
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,810
that you could have approached it one

58
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,200
like most caring parents which is why I

59
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,290
couldn't call on you is to nurture and

60
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:52,210
encourage the kid the old you know this

61
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,470
is how you do it you should do this

62
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,600
better this is you know this is gonna be

63
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,010
a lot safer you'll do it better next

64
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,930
time or like we treat student athletes

65
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,130
usually after they hit around 12 14

66
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,190
years old we come down on them and say

67
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,260
what are you doing I told you how to do

68
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,170
this right do it this way you're being

69
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:14,800
an idiot

70
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,180
and for some reason insecurity and an IT

71
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,490
and just management in general we tend

72
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,070
to lean more towards the latter when

73
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,560
we're trying to communicate a security

74
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,600
program or some sort of concept as

75
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,800
opposed to the former which might be a

76
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,450
little different but might be a little

77
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,760
bit more successful of a tactic so that

78
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,150
autocratic coaching and if you've ever

79
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,680
this oh this presentation always works

80
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,950
great in the US because I always ask

81
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,810
people so I live in Texas and I'm like

82
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,550
who here played high school football at

83
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,170
the entire room puts their hand up and

84
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,330
then I asked them like what would happen

85
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:01,510
if you went to your coach and he he he

86
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,070
would have questions for you like well

87
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,959
you know how did I do at coaching was

88
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,640
that a good session did you learn a lot

89
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,160
from that and they're all like no no

90
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,170
coach of ours would ever say that

91
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,480
because he would be too busy screaming

92
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,048
at us for not doing the right thing and

93
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:22,240
that's kind of the way adult or young

94
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,830
adult sports coaching and Technology

95
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,110
Construction happens you know this is

96
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,060
the way you do something you follow

97
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,639
these steps and you get to the

98
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,330
successful conclusion where you win and

99
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,129
that's not always the best method so

100
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:44,020
every player and I'm going to use the

101
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:50,340
term player and professional co-worker

102
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,560
pure interchangeably because it's really

103
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,650
a lot of the same concepts so if you

104
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,250
want a good team you want people to

105
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,110
perform and people are going to perform

106
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,819
if they feel that they are important to

107
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:08,680
that overall team so this athlete Center

108
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,500
or athletic or athlete centric coaching

109
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,210
style is something that's preached by

110
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,949
the International Olympic Committee and

111
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:17,770
then that flows down to all of the

112
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,680
different sporting organizations around

113
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:27,610
the world so I'm a certified was it USA

114
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,710
rugby level 300 world rugby level 2

115
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,090
coach so that means I can coach an

116
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,460
international rugby team if they wanted

117
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,680
me to based on the last World Cup they

118
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,150
might want me to I don't know

119
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,250
but so I am qualified to instruct in the

120
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,960
manner that follows the International

121
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,000
Olympic Committee's model for

122
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,599
encouraging people to compete and that

123
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:57,610
IOC coaching methodology seems to stop

124
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,589
at a lot of the American sports because

125
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:01,979
it still reverts back to the autocratic

126
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:05,259
screaming yelling do what I told you to

127
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:07,419
do follow the PlayBook everything will

128
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:12,300
be fine so there's there's a great coach

129
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,300
who used to coach the New Zealand All

130
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,310
Blacks his name is Sir Graham Henry and

131
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,159
use arguably one of the greatest coaches

132
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:23,589
especially following this athletes enter

133
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:25,960
coaching style so if you ever watch

134
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,460
rugby or soccer or any outside of North

135
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,810
America type of coaching instructional

136
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,880
venues the coach is never on the

137
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,539
sidelines

138
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:39,219
they're usually sitting up in a booth

139
00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:43,539
because on game day they know that their

140
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:48,270
role was done on Tuesday or Thursday

141
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,430
they're there to let the team

142
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,430
successfully execute the plan you know

143
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,259
they may have microphones and talking to

144
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:58,509
trainers and assistant coaches on the

145
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:00,699
sidelines but they're not there in the

146
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,649
face yelling at the players to do what

147
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:04,240
they're told because they trust the

148
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,330
players that they have been instructed

149
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,490
and they've learned the skills develop

150
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,659
the skills over the course of this

151
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:12,759
period to actually execute on the game

152
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,370
plan to get to their expected end point

153
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,610
so back to sir Graham Henry so he once

154
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:27,699
said that better better people make BLET

155
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:30,880
better all blacks and that's the case in

156
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,709
a lot of security programs and security

157
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:37,080
organizations you know better leaders

158
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:41,440
make better security individuals and

159
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,020
better security individuals make better

160
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,080
security organisations so it becomes it

161
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,120
comes around full circle so better

162
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,500
trained people make better security

163
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,190
decisions make better team decisions to

164
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,259
execute on a security strategy for the

165
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:03,039
organization so if I want you to take

166
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,409
away anything from this session it's to

167
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:08,169
think differently so you can go back to

168
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:10,479
your office and does anyone here a CSO

169
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,250
or a security leader in their

170
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,419
organization or hope to be at some point

171
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:19,000
careful you wish for sometimes it's a

172
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,580
really crappy job but if you want to

173
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,539
become a leader within the organization

174
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,479
that you work for now or in the future

175
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,519
these are some tools to help you

176
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:34,568
communicate either the objectives of the

177
00:08:34,568 --> 00:08:36,190
organization the objectives of your

178
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,240
skills or at least just be a better

179
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,779
person to help them be better people so

180
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:46,260
this is another tool for the tool belt

181
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,819
so there are two distinct coaching

182
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:52,730
styles there's the coach centered

183
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,269
and the player centered so you can use

184
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,130
these interchangeably because different

185
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,829
people require different ways of being

186
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:03,889
coached has anyone ever been told that

187
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:06,709
they're been told that someone was a

188
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:08,959
visual learner have you heard that

189
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,540
before I'm a visual learner or I you

190
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,699
know I can only learn if I'm sent to

191
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:16,940
courses that cost $4,000 a week and an

192
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,230
hour out of the office

193
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,810
well that one's probably a little iffy

194
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,490
but the visual learner thing that's a

195
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,899
real thing there's science behind that

196
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,699
just like learning styles there's

197
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:31,399
different coaching styles so the main

198
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,620
difference and I'm not going to spend a

199
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,800
ton of time on this is that the coach

200
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,910
centric it's drills you're gonna do this

201
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,850
this this this and if you execute these

202
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,699
plans correctly you will get to a

203
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:50,149
successful outcome and this is only

204
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:52,279
gonna work if you listen to what I am

205
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,560
telling you to do don't deviate don't be

206
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,199
creative just do what I'm telling you to

207
00:09:57,199 --> 00:10:00,230
do does anyone remember the old US Army

208
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,339
slogan the army of 1 that kind of

209
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:06,380
backfired because what they really meant

210
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,970
was we're gonna train you to be an

211
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,760
effective soldier but you're also gonna

212
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,100
have to work in a team and we want you

213
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,449
to be able to make those decisions on

214
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:19,459
your own for the greater good of the

215
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:22,880
entire team so I remember in college so

216
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,430
I went Algonquin College for a hot

217
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:29,000
minute and I didn't do very well because

218
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,579
well I went when I was 18 and well

219
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:34,519
what's the drinking age in Hull around

220
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,410
the same also I've looked like this

221
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,510
since I was about 15 so the whole

222
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,010
drinking age thing was never really an

223
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,430
issue but all my friends would turn 18

224
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,589
and we would go over to Hall and drink

225
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:48,829
and and not go to class the next day but

226
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:50,750
one thing they taught you in class is

227
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,610
how to be an individual and how to do

228
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,040
all these things on your own

229
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,980
go learn all of the skills to develop a

230
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,170
program to get your homework done

231
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,420
whatever it is then you get it into the

232
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,170
workforce

233
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,060
and what's the first thing you get

234
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,269
thrown into it's not a single person job

235
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:12,950
you're thrown into a team and you have

236
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,350
to work with other people that were also

237
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,050
told Oren taught how to work as

238
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,940
individuals so that has since changed

239
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,370
since I was in school so there's a lot

240
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,430
more team exercises and group work to

241
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,889
get people to work together because

242
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:30,589
let's be honest most development is

243
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,230
spent searching Google for the right

244
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,600
answer and then taking that code and

245
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,240
putting it back in the system if that

246
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,860
was around I probably would have passed

247
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,089
my classes a lot easier I am very good

248
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:45,949
at foosball though so I will credit

249
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:48,110
Algonquin for getting me very good at

250
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,329
foosball

251
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:52,610
uh this autocratic coaching and the

252
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,810
coach centric is also very

253
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:57,230
technique-driven so a good example is a

254
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,959
spiral throwing a football you know

255
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:02,209
there are certain ways you know don't

256
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:04,550
throw the football fat end forward it's

257
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,180
not going to go very far throw it pointy

258
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,320
end forward spin it follow-through and

259
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,240
it will go further and it will go

260
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,240
straight that is a technique and you see

261
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,310
it it's funny in the in the states you

262
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,760
actually see a just in the back yards

263
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,490
you see these like nets with like the

264
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,320
holes in it so that kids can learn how

265
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,750
to properly throw a football and be the

266
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,750
quarterback and be the star high school

267
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,899
quarterback because that's in Texas that

268
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:38,120
at least that's every kid's dream or

269
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,370
every parent's dream for their kid is to

270
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,220
be the star quarterback and you see them

271
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,570
all over the place that's not something

272
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,180
you really see in Ottawa you know I I

273
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,269
grew up with a hockey net did my parents

274
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,600
think I was gonna be a hockey star I was

275
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,750
not a thin kid or a very athletic kid so

276
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,089
they probably didn't think that in fact

277
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:00,890
I probably would have been like the

278
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,829
happy gilmore get caught taking my skate

279
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:05,329
off to try and stab somebody with it

280
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:08,690
which is why I played rugby so you know

281
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,069
those are techniques that are just

282
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:12,500
repetitive over and over and over again

283
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,380
and has anyone ever tried to teach their

284
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,579
kids something that they're not really

285
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:19,239
interested in

286
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,540
and do they lose interest let me tell

287
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,570
you a story about my father my father

288
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,800
loved to go fishing his idea of going

289
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,930
fishing was getting up at like 4:00 in

290
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,050
the morning getting in a canoe and then

291
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,340
sitting there in silence for eight hours

292
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:43,420
fishing we would do this and I'd be 15

293
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,150
and what do you what does a 15 year old

294
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,760
kid want to do more than sit in silence

295
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,790
for eight hours at a time after getting

296
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,620
up at 4:00 in the morning the answer is

297
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,370
absolutely anything but that so I did

298
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,050
not go fishing with my father and he

299
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,250
would try and teach me how to do

300
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,620
fly-fishing and I just couldn't be

301
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,050
bothered because it was so stupid to me

302
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,720
he made it miserable for me so I didn't

303
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,610
want to keep doing it so that

304
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,040
technique-driven method didn't really

305
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,230
work for me one thing that you'll learn

306
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,540
about a lot of coach centered coaching

307
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,880
is that it's all about winning people

308
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,670
with young kids that are involved in

309
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,460
sports have they been involved in any

310
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,850
sports that are we don't give trophies

311
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,520
or everyone gets a trophy kind of thing

312
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,950
how do you feel about that sir not in

313
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,630
your head it's interesting that's a very

314
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,450
politically correct way to say it I

315
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,100
agree it is interesting I don't have

316
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,820
kids I have two dogs so my statements

317
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,430
may not matter but I you know there is a

318
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,380
time for winning there's a time to learn

319
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,200
when to lose and maybe that is later in

320
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,850
life so a lot of coaches and athletes

321
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,700
enter coaches are showing kids how to

322
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,920
play the game and how to enjoy the game

323
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,900
as opposed to just trying to win the

324
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,040
game the old method is yelling at a an

325
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,900
eight year old till they burst into

326
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,820
tears because they're too fat or they're

327
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,030
not running fast enough I was also not a

328
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:26,590
very fast runner which brings me to the

329
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:31,090
Navy so I was in the Navy like I said

330
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,020
I've looked like this since I was

331
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,190
fifteen so

332
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:37,870
when I was told to run and then run

333
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,060
faster those are two things the

334
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,220
immediately I was no longer interested

335
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,980
in being in the Navy so boot camp was

336
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,000
not for me three I'm from Nova Scotia so

337
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,400
I'm not really that good at French where

338
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:57,370
did I go to boot camp se Zhao where were

339
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,780
all my instructors from Quebec so I

340
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,270
would be screamed at in French to run

341
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,640
and run faster strike three I'm out of

342
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,080
there I don't want to do this anymore

343
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,340
not my thing not my jam so not the best

344
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,190
method to motivate me could be because

345
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,600
I'm an only child I don't know I'm

346
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,020
spoiled

347
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,990
this coach centric method is also very

348
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,830
do what I say

349
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,360
I'm gonna show you once and then you're

350
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,800
gonna perfect it I'm never gonna have to

351
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,780
show you again just look at the playbook

352
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,150
it shows you how to do it no questions

353
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:37,270
good do this and then it's again you

354
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,160
know this is the way to do it don't

355
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,440
deviate from it because I've you know I

356
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,190
have years of experience as a parent of

357
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,320
a four year old so I know exactly how to

358
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,720
coach this team

359
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,860
well that doesn't hold a lot of weight

360
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,890
but you know I've worked with people and

361
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,970
I so not only do I coach adults I've

362
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,900
also taken ownership or I've been

363
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,089
volunteered to coach the high school

364
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,579
team which means I not only have to

365
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:08,709
coach high school students but I have to

366
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:12,220
now coach parents all at the same time

367
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,310
so it's a lot of juggling and it's you

368
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,260
know they're expecting me to come in and

369
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,900
show their kids how to win how to enjoy

370
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,209
the game how to balance their

371
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,980
expectations how to balance the kids

372
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,420
expectation so I'm doing this huge

373
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,300
juggling act but they look to me as K

374
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,500
this guy has to know all the answers

375
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,030
because he's now the head coach for the

376
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,300
high school team surprise I don't so

377
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,670
they will learn that very quickly so

378
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,810
it's going to be a learning process for

379
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:42,160
all of us now the player centric the

380
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,110
International Olympic Committee has this

381
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,059
concept and if you've got young kids

382
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:49,129
you've probably seen this it's the whole

383
00:17:49,129 --> 00:17:53,059
coaching through games because if you

384
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:56,080
tell someone hey we're gonna do a drill

385
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,730
they immediately think crap we're gonna

386
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,350
have to do a drill if you say we're

387
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,779
gonna play a game like oh crap

388
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:04,700
I love games games are fun let's play

389
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,009
games so you're doing these games to

390
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:08,990
reinforce the skills and the

391
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,210
understanding over time so you're making

392
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,730
it fun and enjoyable and you're making

393
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,889
it a little competitive so that they're

394
00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:19,340
working with one another to get to an

395
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,139
end goal but also to beat another team

396
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:28,669
so I promise this starts to float into

397
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:33,220
InfoSec very shortly with examples

398
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:38,119
player centric athlete centric focused

399
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:40,519
on the needs of the individual learner

400
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,070
or a small group of learners so if you

401
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,590
think of we go back to the individual

402
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,200
that says I'm a visual learner if you

403
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,080
give them nothing but books or a policy

404
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,200
on how to how the organization deals

405
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,879
with phishing emails do you think

406
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:58,190
they're really gonna care probably not

407
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,929
if you gave them a scenario or they

408
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:01,429
could click around and actually see

409
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:03,759
things might that be better for them to

410
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,279
comprehend what's going on yes does that

411
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,470
scale well across a large organization

412
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:14,149
no but the trade-off is that you are

413
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:16,429
tailoring the program for individual

414
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:20,840
learners to reinforce that skill so that

415
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,100
they don't have to keep running back to

416
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,389
you every time they have a question on

417
00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:25,669
it so it reinforces the learning for

418
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:29,210
that individual based on their ability

419
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:33,009
to absorb and recall knowledge and

420
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:35,720
you're helping really develop your

421
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,950
players so the IOC is all about not just

422
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,759
getting people to become athletes to win

423
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:44,720
at the Olympics

424
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,460
it's to help perpetuate the learning

425
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,399
cycle so you Michael Phelps is a great

426
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:56,840
example arguably the best swimmer in the

427
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,649
Olympics ever

428
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,650
I guarantee you his retirement plan will

429
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,400
is not I'm gonna retire and I'm gonna do

430
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,140
nothing but subway commercials this is

431
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,420
gonna be awesome this is the pinnacle of

432
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:16,880
my career know they're hoping that he is

433
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,820
going to coach others on the US swimming

434
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,030
team how to be like him whether that's

435
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,880
from a direct coaching perspective or an

436
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,980
advisor or helping get people and

437
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,650
excited about the sports and bring them

438
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,960
in maybe he's just an ambassador but

439
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,450
it's perpetuating that need to develop

440
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,450
that player and that individual to get

441
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,730
other people involved so you're

442
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,410
developing a leader through following

443
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:47,060
this systematic approach that can then

444
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,250
be used down the road for the

445
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,770
organization in this case the USA

446
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,860
Swimming Committee it's also a very

447
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,080
democratic way of teaching people and

448
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,940
sharing learning so one thing that we do

449
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,610
a lot of is asking questions so it's

450
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,580
very hands-off democratic what do you

451
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,260
think about this what might be a better

452
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,960
way to do that what are the consequences

453
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,070
of not executing XYZ so you're having

454
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:19,130
people answer questions and you might

455
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,570
think okay well there's always going to

456
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,610
be a handful of people that kind of

457
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,580
stand back and let other people answer I

458
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,990
can tell you some ways to actually

459
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,360
encourage other people to jump in if

460
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,220
they're just wallflowers and don't

461
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,960
really want to be involved and that's

462
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,360
where games come into play and it's very

463
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,570
informal we want people to learn the

464
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,970
basics but also be creative we want

465
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,350
creative individuals that are going to

466
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,530
learn how to secure the organization how

467
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:51,890
to perform in a sports environment or an

468
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:56,260
athletic environment by setting the goal

469
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,430
giving them the tools to get to that

470
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,950
goal we don't care what happens in the

471
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:05,510
middle provided it's legal they can draw

472
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,370
on their skills and head towards that

473
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,870
end goal because ultimately that's what

474
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,430
we care about is the end goal and

475
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,760
developing the players

476
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,570
so this coaching continuing continuum

477
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:22,790
four phases to it so what you do is you

478
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:25,400
and I'll use an example here in a moment

479
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,460
so you're setting up the scenario you're

480
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,470
going to instruct what's going to happen

481
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,020
and explain what the outcomes are what

482
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,580
the objectives are you're going to

483
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,040
demonstrate so that visual learners can

484
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,650
comprehend what's going on because you

485
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,240
know we work a lot of people where

486
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,740
English is not their first language they

487
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,440
may not immediately resonate with the

488
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,240
way that you're communicating some

489
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,130
people that give presentations English

490
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,080
isn't their first language so the way

491
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,120
they're communicating doesn't just

492
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,720
doesn't mesh with the learner then the

493
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,210
instructor or the coach is gonna stand

494
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:03,110
back let them do the game do the

495
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,360
activity and then help them along the

496
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,070
way as needed for the individual

497
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:10,040
learners to succeed and then you go to

498
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,470
the feedback phase so it's not just

499
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,130
getting feedback from them on the

500
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:19,340
objectives but also feedback about you

501
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,430
as a coach and I guarantee you if you

502
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:26,150
ask an employee before going through

503
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,340
this continuing has anyone ever asked

504
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,710
for like a 360 review at work yes you

505
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:38,420
miss was it a glowing review no was

506
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,470
their name on it the anonymized reviews

507
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:47,180
are generally I'd say more biting than

508
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,550
the ones where you know if you have one

509
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,860
employee and you ask for a 360 review

510
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,600
they're probably not going to come back

511
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,800
and say well you're the worst boss ever

512
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,000
because you're going to know immediately

513
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,580
that it's them so that that's probably

514
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,410
not a very good career move on their

515
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,310
part if so if you ask a group how am i

516
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,300
doing was that a good way to do this

517
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,430
unless you make it an open communication

518
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,710
before you even get to that and this

519
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:18,110
process will build up they will happily

520
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,940
tell you how crappy you are and what you

521
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,820
could do better and it will be presented

522
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,520
and received in a way and perceived by

523
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,170
you as a way

524
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,910
to make things better for the next group

525
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,280
of people so you'll see what I mean in a

526
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,410
minute here so when you are doing the

527
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,210
instruction phase make sure you always

528
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,360
plan what you're going to say so at

529
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,870
halftime I was notorious for walking out

530
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,600
onto the field and we're either and

531
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,640
we're losing let's say we're losing by

532
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,490
like ten points and I would walk out in

533
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,140
the field I'd be all flustered I'd be

534
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:56,240
like well that wasn't very good let's

535
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,580
let's do better next half

536
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,440
you know let's all those things that we

537
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,020
sucked at in the first half we shouldn't

538
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,520
do that we should do that better that's

539
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,760
not how we learned all right so go go do

540
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,650
better and there everyone's like what

541
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,840
the was that like that that's not

542
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,490
gonna help me learn like what did I do

543
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:13,880
wrong

544
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,190
I think apparently everything so it's

545
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,550
not a very good way to communicate what

546
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,340
needs to improve and what was you know

547
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,560
what could be tweaked or nudged so

548
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,120
always plan what you're gonna say before

549
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,570
you speak because or plan what you're

550
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,620
gonna say before you speak because you

551
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,830
if you exude confidence people are going

552
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,870
to receive that as oh this person knows

553
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:36,830
what they're talking about and I will

554
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,660
listen to this person make sure you

555
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,070
always gain the attention of the person

556
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,880
before the people before you start

557
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,670
especially in this age of mobile devices

558
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,900
you don't want to keep rheic splaining

559
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,810
yourself so get everyone's attention and

560
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:53,900
then keep it nice short bite-sized chunk

561
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,020
type messages just sound bytes think of

562
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,760
it as sound bytes everything they need

563
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,340
to do to perform the task and that's it

564
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,180
no more the more flowery language you

565
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,070
put on it the more difficult is going to

566
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,760
be to move on to the next phase because

567
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,350
you'll start going down the path you'll

568
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,880
say oh I've got a story about that and

569
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,370
blah blah and you'll never get on to the

570
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,470
they'll lose the the short things that

571
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,600
you told them at the beginning and then

572
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,790
make sure you always ask questions and

573
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,640
this is the this is opening the door to

574
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,480
getting them comfortable around you and

575
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,180
around their peers to actually ask some

576
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,730
questions that they may not understand

577
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,160
so here's an example all right so we're

578
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,460
gonna do a fishing scenario so I'm going

579
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,090
to go in I'm going to

580
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,790
get their attention I've got my notes on

581
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,890
what I'm going to focus on I'm gonna ask

582
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,570
questions make sure everyone understands

583
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,980
what we're gonna talk about for this

584
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,320
phishing scenario gain their attention

585
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,020
Carrie hey everyone could everyone hear

586
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,480
me that's a great way to open it up can

587
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,520
everyone hear me because usually that's

588
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,600
when people will look up from their

589
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,150
phones I got crap I can't hear them so

590
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,710
we're gonna get started on this phishing

591
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:06,110
email identification group exercise it's

592
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,260
gonna be really fun and we're all gonna

593
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,680
get involved here short message so I

594
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,840
want everyone to take a look at three

595
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,540
emails and discuss with your partner if

596
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,490
they look legitimate or more like

597
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,350
phishing emails so I'm gonna give you

598
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:25,730
two minutes per email to discuss with

599
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:28,460
your teammate and then whichever team

600
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,380
has the best analysis is declared the

601
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,050
winner so that's a short message okay

602
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,810
three emails work with your teammate to

603
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:38,740
find what's wrong and document it

604
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,940
present your findings at the end and

605
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,160
you're gonna be a winner if you do it

606
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,950
the best note I've not told them what

607
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,020
they're gonna win it's just that they're

608
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,060
gonna be a winner and everyone likes to

609
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,890
be told that they are a winner even if

610
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,450
there's nothing at the other end of that

611
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,980
rainbow no pot of gold

612
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,590
they just know well should I want to be

613
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:00,080
a winner I want to beat my other these

614
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,670
other teams in here I'm gonna work

615
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,320
harder I'm gonna work hard to win

616
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,620
because I want to be a winner like I

617
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,210
said I'm an only child and that's very

618
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,860
important to me I want to be a winner

619
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:14,690
all the time so number four just clarify

620
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,030
so we're doing three emails two minutes

621
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,710
each discuss the features with your

622
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,300
partner does that make sense for

623
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,840
everyone does anyone have any questions

624
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:28,520
that is a great way to finish trying to

625
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,830
get clarification does that make sense

626
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,420
because if it doesn't make sense I'm

627
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,770
going to put their hand up and ask and

628
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,530
if no one answers that okay does anyone

629
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,830
have any questions before we move on

630
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,330
you're giving them two opportunities to

631
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,540
put their hand up and ask you a question

632
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,510
so the reason we ask questions is to

633
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,370
check for knowledge to check for

634
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,710
comprehension and to check to make sure

635
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,980
they know how they're applying that null

636
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,710
knowledge to a game situation in this

637
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,290
case the fishing exercise the fishing

638
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,929
training exercise and the players or

639
00:29:02,929 --> 00:29:05,450
professionals use that information to

640
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,690
analyze themselves okay well this is

641
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,040
what they're asking of me I'm pretty

642
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,770
sure I've got this understood

643
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:15,260
synthesizing it so that they can okay

644
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,559
well he said this I think he means this

645
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:20,059
yeah he definitely means this so I know

646
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,919
what I can do and then evaluate okay

647
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,090
well I know that if I get the top if I

648
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,890
if me and my teammate here get all the

649
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,450
best answers we're gonna win and winning

650
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:32,750
is important and we'll be winners I'm

651
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,549
still not sure what I'm gonna win but

652
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:36,049
I'm gonna be a winner and I like that so

653
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:40,669
far so now before you get started you

654
00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:42,140
could easily just say alright we're

655
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,510
gonna do this now jump into it do your

656
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:47,059
thing but there's a chance that someone

657
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:50,419
may not understand so that's when you do

658
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:52,910
just a short demonstration so make sure

659
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,890
that you can position position yourself

660
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,330
so everyone can hear you you know front

661
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:59,720
of the room just focus on one or two

662
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,660
points in your demo if you need to

663
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,940
repeat it again if you see some blank

664
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,820
faces around the room and then again ask

665
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,120
questions or invite those questions and

666
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,679
check to make sure everyone understands

667
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:15,679
so this is like there all right you know

668
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,590
what we're gonna go on this road trip if

669
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,350
anyone has to pee do it now not turning

670
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,100
the car around

671
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,559
I mean it this time this is like the

672
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,870
last chance obviously you're not

673
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,790
demonstrating how to pee that's maybe

674
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,200
that's the worst analogy I could have

675
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,809
used but you get what I'm going for here

676
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:37,940
so I heard two gentlemen over here

677
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,210
talking about rugby earlier was it you

678
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:44,540
sir maybe you're talking about Sonny

679
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,900
Bill Williams all right so I presume

680
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,410
that you know rugby not just the guy's

681
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:59,020
name have you played before alright so

682
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,480
can you instruct me how to perform a

683
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,870
sidestep

684
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:11,830
No so yeah so essentially what you're

685
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:15,340
asking you can tell someone how to do a

686
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,740
sidestep just do a sidestep and they're

687
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,720
like okay so I just do this instead of

688
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,670
running forward well there's more to it

689
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:25,480
so a sidestep is really

690
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,220
hey you're running fast at someone Full

691
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,810
Tilt and then you have to change

692
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:31,300
directions so that you avoid the tackle

693
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,180
and it sounds kind of simple when you

694
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,940
say it like that but there's a lot

695
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,240
involved there's a lot of mechanics

696
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,840
involved especially if you've taken

697
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,220
kinesiology or kinematics and dynamics

698
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,260
you know that there's a lot of muscles

699
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,920
and ligaments and tendons involved in

700
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,140
something as simple as changing

701
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,890
direction while running so these are the

702
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,560
textbook answers so you target the

703
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,030
nearest defender you're running with the

704
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:04,750
ball change direction as close as

705
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,000
possible because if I change direction

706
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,370
far away they're gonna know where I'm

707
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,730
going and they're gonna go that way too

708
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,740
so change direction close to the ball

709
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,920
you're gonna plant your foot and then

710
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,040
spring off of that foot with maximum

711
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,170
effort to change directions and then

712
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,450
accelerate in the other direction if you

713
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,830
do it too close you're gonna run into

714
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,110
them if you do it too far back they're

715
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,400
gonna know where you're going so you

716
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,770
have to find that sweet spot of knowing

717
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:41,830
when to cut and bypass them so let's do

718
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:49,210
another thing here Kelman my man I would

719
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:53,200
like you to instruct me how to drink

720
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,180
from that water bottle but the caveat is

721
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:02,260
I am blind see there's a lot of things

722
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:06,130
involved in teaching someone a seemingly

723
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,560
simple skill like you saying you know

724
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,800
put your arm out alright my arms out

725
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,900
move it down more okay move it to the

726
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,200
right all right like so we went through

727
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,490
this the last time I gave this

728
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,510
presentation

729
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:22,450
got to the situation where the guys like

730
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,600
okay well put your you're standing right

731
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,190
in front of it okay so I know where I am

732
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,770
put your hand at a 45 degree downward

733
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:33,660
angle okay move slightly to the right

734
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,360
okay okay now go slightly to the left

735
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,700
like okay yeah I found it

736
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,420
okay now grasp it bend your elbow

737
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,060
towards your mouth use your other hand

738
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,040
to twist the cap in a counterclockwise

739
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,670
position and then when you are ready

740
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:55,870
open your mouth and lift the bottle

741
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:59,110
towards your lips not at a horrible

742
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,300
angle because you may pour the water all

743
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,010
over yourself but just gently bring it

744
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,510
towards your lips and then you should

745
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,030
have an easy way to drink water like

746
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,070
that's a lot of instruction for

747
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:12,520
something as simple as drink a bottle of

748
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,110
water and some people require that level

749
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,850
of instruction so that's the need of the

750
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:21,100
individual learner so just like a

751
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,530
sidestep is more than walk to the side

752
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:27,310
it's difficult and it takes a lot of

753
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:30,989
energy to teach someone something new

754
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:35,199
but I guarantee you now if you go back

755
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,600
to your office and you do this same

756
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,899
exercise of the show me how to drink

757
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:41,320
water

758
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,139
pretend I'm blind you'll probably be

759
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:46,719
able to instruct those people after they

760
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,360
failed miserably the first time some of

761
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,149
the cues to actually coach them to

762
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:57,490
instruct someone in the future or if you

763
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:58,630
don't like them you'll get them to pour

764
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,010
the water all over themselves either way

765
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:04,600
it'll be fun for everybody so actually

766
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,280
one thing about positioning so everyone

767
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,350
can see in here if you're standing on

768
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:12,100
outdoors in a sports field and you're

769
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,290
addressing a team where should you stand

770
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:20,070
relative to where the Sun is

771
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:28,079
right so I'm facing this on why so they

772
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,670
can see me because you don't want them

773
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:33,210
squinting and you want them to be able

774
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:36,660
to see your expressions ask any

775
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,430
questions you don't want them getting

776
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,079
bored and looking away because their

777
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,119
eyes hurt because of the Sun you know

778
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:45,599
they don't teach that in the in rugby

779
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,960
coaching until the level 300 so after

780
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,410
you've already coached people for five

781
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,750
years only then do they say hey you know

782
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,910
what don't stand with the Sun at your

783
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:00,809
back and now whenever I'm coaching am i

784
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:02,190
all right where the hell's the Sun okay

785
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,170
so it's over there so yeah can everyone

786
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,660
could everyone stand here yeah you can't

787
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,990
stand with the Sun behind me so it's

788
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,520
just one of those things so in this case

789
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,539
we're standing at the front of the room

790
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:16,260
so everyone can see the screen projector

791
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,779
whatever we're gonna focus on to one to

792
00:36:18,779 --> 00:36:21,329
two key points so before we get started

793
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:22,529
we're going to take a look at a sample

794
00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:24,240
email so I'm gonna bring it up on the

795
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,819
screen note the suspicious email address

796
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:28,829
when I hover over the sender's name so

797
00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:31,140
that's one thing and then also note the

798
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,970
sender is asking me to send strangely

799
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,069
sensitive information that they've never

800
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:36,960
really asked for in the past so those

801
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,569
are two things you might want to note

802
00:36:38,569 --> 00:36:41,880
then repeat it if you have to all right

803
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,670
sample email number two it's an expected

804
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,369
email address when we hover over it with

805
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:50,089
the mouse the email is also asking for

806
00:36:50,089 --> 00:36:52,950
information that this person always asks

807
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,470
for so it's not that strange so this

808
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,779
could be a legitimate email so you

809
00:36:57,779 --> 00:36:59,789
should note that as well and then you

810
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:02,160
ask them you know these are a couple of

811
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,829
examples there are going to be more

812
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:06,660
things that you are likely going to find

813
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:10,470
in your analysis does anyone have any

814
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:14,039
questions so that's that final asking

815
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:16,349
for input and because you've gone

816
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:18,089
through this a couple times and asked

817
00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:22,260
questions by this point you will get far

818
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,380
more people if they don't understand or

819
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,559
have further questions they will ask I

820
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:30,180
don't know what it is there's there has

821
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,740
to be some science behind it

822
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,910
but if you give people enough

823
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,490
opportunities to actually ask a question

824
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,349
and show that it's

825
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:39,150
it's an inclusive environment and then

826
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,859
everyone's on the same team and trying

827
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,749
to learn if they don't understand

828
00:37:42,749 --> 00:37:43,829
they're probably gonna put their hand up

829
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,660
like I said there's got to be some

830
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,430
science behind it I don't know what it

831
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,220
is but in my anecdotal experience run

832
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,279
into it all the time so then you're

833
00:37:53,279 --> 00:37:55,589
doing the the observe observe and report

834
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:58,190
so you're gonna focus on the key factors

835
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,170
key factor of this case being okay well

836
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,420
they they should probably mouse over the

837
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,970
email address we should look for content

838
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,160
we should maybe look at headers any

839
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,170
other information that might be

840
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:12,660
suspicious in these emails and then walk

841
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,130
around the room don't just stand at the

842
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,289
front of the room because if someone is

843
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:19,470
not understanding you can just go and

844
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,420
help that individual just nudge them

845
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:25,170
towards the right answer or ask them you

846
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,749
know what were we doing when we were

847
00:38:27,749 --> 00:38:29,220
messing over all we were seeing if the

848
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,099
email was was legitimate or not okay

849
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:34,109
well does this email look legitimate no

850
00:38:34,109 --> 00:38:35,460
it doesn't like okay well there's one

851
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,229
thing if you have any other questions

852
00:38:37,229 --> 00:38:38,970
let me know and then continue walking

853
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:42,329
around the room and then when everyone's

854
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:46,410
done you can get everyone to present

855
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:52,469
their findings and really you're you're

856
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:54,299
helping them determine further actions

857
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:57,359
in the future so if there was something

858
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,969
that was wrong in your training plan or

859
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:02,430
the way that you communicated how things

860
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:06,359
were should have shaken out at the end

861
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:08,670
this is when they come back to you and

862
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,869
say well yeah this didn't really work

863
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:11,579
when we did this why was that and you

864
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,440
have a chance to actually help nudge or

865
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,859
help correct it around yeah along the

866
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:21,210
end way so there's two types of ways to

867
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,190
ask for feedback there's the push in the

868
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:26,579
poll model for any of you that have

869
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:30,539
teenagers you ask hey which I learned at

870
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:33,200
school today what's the answer

871
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,390
nothing surely you couldn't have learned

872
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:39,979
nothing you had to learn something nope

873
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:43,969
nothing so that's you're really trying

874
00:39:43,969 --> 00:39:46,920
to just pull information out of them

875
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,289
with these clarifying questions and

876
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:51,990
that's a legitimate way to do it

877
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:55,220
if you've ever given or received

878
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,500
feedback for performance evaluation what

879
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,670
do they tell you state one positive

880
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,860
state a negative but then you know you

881
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,390
want to sandwich that with another

882
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,280
positive so you don't sound like a jerk

883
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,590
so you have that nasty one in the middle

884
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,290
and then two good ones on the outside

885
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:15,120
well that's you you're you're kind of

886
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,640
pushing for feedback there okay you did

887
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,920
this really well you did this well but

888
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,080
you kind of screwed up over here you

889
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,080
need to do that better the next time

890
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,880
and what this example doesn't show you

891
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,580
is that anchoring business school thing

892
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,590
of oh yeah you did this really well too

893
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,560
you know high five let's keep on being

894
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,260
friends let's be work friends the pull

895
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,020
method is really okay well what worked

896
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,240
what went well so at the end of that

897
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,540
scenario you could ask them hey what did

898
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,780
you guys learn or what do you guys do

899
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,790
that would help you recognize things

900
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:53,510
like this in your job you know can you

901
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:57,270
can you now identify phishing emails and

902
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,350
what are some of the things that you can

903
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,120
look for and the way I would do this

904
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,010
this isn't this okay well what didn't

905
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,480
work you know what are some of the

906
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,250
things that you expected to happen that

907
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,370
didn't really happen oh well you know

908
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:10,140
I'm most over the email it you know

909
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,790
there's no pop up or anything so I

910
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,530
didn't really know if that was legit or

911
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,600
not okay that's fair so what would you

912
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,410
do next time

913
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,720
okay well I could forward the email and

914
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,790
that would show me the email address I

915
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:22,320
could look at the headers like blah blah

916
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,930
blah and everyone's kind of contributing

917
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,820
at that point and you've got everyone in

918
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,310
a group and you're helping people answer

919
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,530
each other in a more democratic way so

920
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,030
everyone's helping each other we're

921
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,280
getting stronger as a team as opposed to

922
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,010
just individual athletes or performers

923
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:41,340
and that doesn't stop at the coach

924
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,310
either because that's when you say okay

925
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:46,260
well what did I do well in communicating

926
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:50,790
this scenario was I clear did this you

927
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,320
know what could I have done something

928
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,680
better you know what didn't I do well

929
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,930
help me learn so that next time for the

930
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,610
next group I can communicate this better

931
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:02,250
because I want to make sure that the

932
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,440
next group doesn't have some of these

933
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,190
questions that you

934
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,230
ran into so what could I do better as a

935
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:11,190
coach as a security manager as the see

936
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:14,010
so to communicate why fishing is

937
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:17,660
important and the ways to spot fishing

938
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:23,480
so it may seem like a very arduous task

939
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,400
but it's another way to help people

940
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,670
understand things and we've already

941
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:32,430
talked about over and over again how you

942
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,859
know not everyone learns the same way so

943
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:37,530
my wife is an instructional designer who

944
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:40,980
left tech had her midlife crisis and

945
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,319
became a personal trainer and which

946
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:44,819
means that I can never have a midlife

947
00:42:44,819 --> 00:42:46,410
crisis because we can't afford it now

948
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:50,069
that she's had one but she yo she's

949
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:51,960
learned she's taken her knowledge of

950
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,810
training adults and taking it to helping

951
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:57,390
people get more physically fit so she

952
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,520
knows some of the key things to hone in

953
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,220
on for people that work in IT and tech

954
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,109
in general because they have office jobs

955
00:43:04,109 --> 00:43:06,690
so she knows how to you know pull some

956
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,540
of those strings to help them relate to

957
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,710
one another and it's it's just one

958
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:16,200
method of coaching so she knows you know

959
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,530
questions to ask that only appear in

960
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,109
that type of scenario would be able to

961
00:43:22,109 --> 00:43:24,060
answer or even ask in the first place

962
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,839
and understand so one thing I strongly

963
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,990
believe in is that security just like

964
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:33,660
coaching is not about you it's about the

965
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,569
team you know Bill Belichick might be a

966
00:43:36,569 --> 00:43:40,440
great coach but he alone cannot win a

967
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,880
Super Bowl he may believe that but you

968
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,579
know he builds a team around the

969
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:52,920
organization to win Super Bowls you

970
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,170
can't just have individuals and if you

971
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:57,089
use these player centered coaching

972
00:43:57,089 --> 00:44:00,210
techniques in the workplace you will

973
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,829
grow understanding you will reach people

974
00:44:01,829 --> 00:44:03,839
that you were unable to reach before

975
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,910
that may have just tuned out because

976
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,339
you're tailoring it for them so if

977
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:09,839
anything I'll help you get better as a

978
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,880
security leader within the organization

979
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,210
and with that the red lights on these

980

984
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:36,589
