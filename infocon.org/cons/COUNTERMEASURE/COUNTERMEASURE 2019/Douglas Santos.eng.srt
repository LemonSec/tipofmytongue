2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,460
my name is Douglas Santos and I work at

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,410
the security strategies for 40 guar labs

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,750
which is a division of for aguar that

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,490
specializes in threat research in

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,670
response and as a security strategies I

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,039
have a couple of responsibilities one of

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,220
them as I said before is to keep an eye

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,199
on the threat landscape understand how

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,449
the treads are shifting and working with

11
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,490
the developers not only to understand

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,710
how can we mitigate that given threat

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,960
but also how can we make our engines

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,030
better sometimes it's just a matter of a

15
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,430
signature update so let's say we come

16
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,559
across a new mower sample and we

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,390
understand that just with a given

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,370
signature with the given features and

19
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,230
capabilities of the AV engine were able

20
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,239
to mitigate the threat but sometimes

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,670
that requires something else so for

22
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,199
instance who here remembers their wing

23
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,780
hire AC vulnerability right that was a

24
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,000
vulnerability in the wing har product

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,520
that once you supply it with AC which is

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,739
a common encryption and compression

27
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,020
algorithm when you feed a vulnerable

28
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,500
version of wing her corrupted structure

29
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,320
ace with a corrupted structure that will

30
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,360
basically trigger a vulnerability in

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,100
suing her allowing for a remote code

32
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,680
execution so on that particular case our

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,479
AV engine was unable to deal with that

34
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,080
so we had to rewrite our AC parsing

35
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,130
engine because if we feed we before the

36
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,340
the engine has been revamped and

37
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,890
restructured if we feed a specific AC

38
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,960
file corrupted that had that

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,750
vulnerability the engine will simply not

40
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,460
not parse it correctly and it wouldn't

41
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,990
see that there's actually an Arab leader

42
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,369
and exploit on that other

43
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:48,689
responsibilities include revamping our

44
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,450
cyber threat intelligence feeds for

45
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,790
Annette does provide a cyber threat

46
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,170
intelligence feed in the form of

47
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,000
automated feeds that can be incorporated

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,110
into cm cm tools or trade intelligence

49
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,360
platforms but right now we're only

50
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,170
pushing

51
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,179
what they call automated feeds which is

52
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:13,000
basically IP our IP addresses URLs

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,910
hashes there's not too much context so

54
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,489
right now I'm one of the guys that's

55
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:20,860
leading the data science project to make

56
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,600
sure that we're able to understand

57
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,730
campaigns threat actors and extract

58
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,150
TTP's out of those malware samples to

59
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,340
make sure that the threat intelligence

60
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,280
feed has more context and more

61
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,440
information so that our customers and

62
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,630
our partners are able to have more

63
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,580
visibility and context around those

64
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,380
threats other than just IP our IP

65
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,400
addresses URLs and hashes so I'm gonna

66
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,019
be talking a little bit about handsomer

67
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:48,940
involution ransomware has been around

68
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,910
for more from our time that we give

69
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,989
credit for and it just seemed timely to

70
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:58,180
to talk to you guys about this because

71
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,730
at the very peak of ransomware evolution

72
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,549
it is targeting government institutions

73
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:05,680
and municipalities like never before

74
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,109
all right so ok so I'll show you this

75
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:13,239
this trend have started earlier and it

76
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,070
didn't actually started as encrypting

77
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,680
any files it basically just scrambled

78
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,260
some of the filesystem structures in a

79
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,440
way that wouldn't make we wouldn't be

80
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,370
able to access your of all your files so

81
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,680
naive and unexperienced computer users

82
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,299
would be helpless against this this

83
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:34,720
first strain of viruses then we will

84
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,730
explain how in a few slides how old

85
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,350
techniques have changed from

86
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,280
spray-and-pray

87
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,299
some very focused and targeted attacks

88
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:47,049
that trend has started somewhere be 2 or

89
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:49,019
2 or 3 years ago when a cloud computing

90
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,750
company has been held ransom for 1

91
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,500
million dollars

92
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,319
I think it was in China the so our

93
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,209
ransomware got ahold got a breach into

94
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:01,750
their networks and it got he got into

95
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,760
all of their Linux servers so most of

96
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,900
the their customers infrastructure and

97
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,609
services were held from him some and

98
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:11,530
they were requesting 1 million dollars

99
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,930
in Bitcoin

100
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,819
then we're gonna be talking a little bit

101
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:18,079
about what are the distribution vectors

102
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,879
being leveraged by ransomware 30 years

103
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,639
ago which started out very different

104
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,629
than it is today now we have four or

105
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:31,879
five main delivery methods some of them

106
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,879
are way scarier than others some of them

107
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:37,370
doesn't even require any interaction

108
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,960
from the user for the payload to be

109
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,860
triggered which is very scary and then

110
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,229
I'm gonna shift to some of the recent

111
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:47,539
ransomware attacks namely the Robin Hood

112
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:50,629
malware which is which is targeting

113
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:52,879
government municipalities in the US and

114
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,219
in Canada and I think it's very timely

115
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:57,080
for us to discuss this that distrained

116
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,229
and how it has affected lots of cities

117
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:02,659
in the US and what they are doing to

118
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:06,229
fight us and then obviously some key

119
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:10,520
recommendations that we usually usually

120
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,930
give to our customers and others

121
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,610
provides some of them are very obvious

122
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,229
they've been talking about this for a

123
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:20,599
long time some of us some of some of the

124
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:23,270
other key recommendations may not be as

125
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,099
as known as as the other ones and what

126
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:29,389
to do if you don't follow their

127
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:30,469
recommendations right how can you

128
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:32,150
recover from him somewhere what you do

129
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,270
when everything else has failed

130
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,159
what should we why should we focus our

131
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:40,610
efforts on so before I start diving into

132
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,719
the into the actual evolution of

133
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,759
ransomware I'd like to talk a little bit

134
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,500
about how has malware and malware

135
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,849
detection technologies how it has

136
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,330
evolved well in in in the very beginning

137
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,560
there was only signature basic solutions

138
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,219
right so you have one malware you can

139
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:03,169
calculate the hash of that malware and

140
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:05,330
you put that hash into a database you

141
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,490
push that database to your customers and

142
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,529
you have protection against those

143
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:14,089
specific specific file but that doesn't

144
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:16,490
scale very much or not at all actually

145
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,990
and if you take that specific sample of

146
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,580
virus and change just one bit of

147
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,710
information one bit that might not even

148
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,959
actually change any functionality of

149
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,479
them our boom you have another hash so

150
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:31,240
obviously this is not

151
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,220
this is not optimally this doesn't scale

152
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,680
at all so the second generation comes in

153
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,240
and then we're talking about send boxes

154
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,460
right so you're actually getting this

155
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,710
the specific malware we are running it

156
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,479
into a controlled environment you are

157
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:46,449
looking at open files make connections

158
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:50,440
op drop files opening other processes

159
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,870
address space trying to hide it's cold

160
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,030
into the other other process address

161
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,389
space and that was that was good for for

162
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:03,180
some time and it's some recent research

163
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,000
says that almost 50% of all Canadian

164
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,030
companies have some form of sandbox

165
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,310
technology if not on-premises on the

166
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,250
cloud so that can help you less and the

167
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,860
time to detect a little bit not not by

168
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,349
much but it does help and then we have

169
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:22,330
the third generation which is based on

170
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,130
machine learning solutions so we're

171
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,979
quickly trying to understand everything

172
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,680
that makes malware actually looks like

173
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,990
Mauer so basically we're employing

174
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,169
static and dynamic analysis so we can

175
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:37,630
extract what we call features from those

176
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,120
mowers and on top of those features we

177
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,199
try to understand on how how many pieces

178
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,199
of malware that specific thing appear

179
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,360
and it obviously if it's a one specific

180
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,949
feature that we've just found in one

181
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:53,409
malware that were just analyzed happens

182
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:56,740
to be found on 80% of them our then we

183
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,830
know via mathematical mathematics that

184
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,080
it is 80 percent or so good in actually

185
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,979
detecting malware but even so that the

186
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:12,400
the efficacy and how good that specific

187
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,250
that specific solution is depend on

188
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,250
where you are employing this specific

189
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,639
feature or visibility so I'm if you're

190
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,710
if you're looking at static and dynamic

191
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,840
behaviors awesome that is really good

192
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,570
but what if the instrumentation that

193
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,520
you're using to get those static and

194
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,770
dynamic behaviors are being made at the

195
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,320
operational operation of system level 50

196
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,208
if the mouse is doing syscalls it's

197
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,190
interacting with with the operating

198
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,380
system that might be good we may may be

199
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,840
may call it but what if the

200
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,550
it's an it's a malware that is being

201
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,040
written in a new language right so the

202
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,900
difference is calls different memory

203
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,840
layouts different opcodes and what if

204
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,060
mauer is completely reading in assembly

205
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,700
language that's gonna just cross right

206
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,550
over it right so but going back to

207
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,550
ransomware evolution the first instance

208
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,660
of ransomware

209
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,740
that we had notice off was virus that

210
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,420
was unleashed in nineteen nineteen

211
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,280
eighty-nine that predates the Internet

212
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,430
as we know it right back then that was

213
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,400
the sexiest haircut that I may you can

214
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,400
have not this guy obviously most of us

215
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,390
girls were looking for Mel Gibson right

216
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:29,560
well that in 1989 an American

217
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,570
evolutionary biologist by the name of

218
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,930
Joseph L pop thought it was a good idea

219
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,240
he was actually at that time working

220
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,450
with AIDS research so what he did was he

221
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,540
wrote a little program that was

222
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,770
disguised as a questionnaire II for

223
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,940
assessing the risk of somebody having

224
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,790
AIDS but he actually was a Trojan right

225
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,130
so he was attending a World Health

226
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,920
Organization at that time and he mailed

227
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,530
it mailed it via regular mail to 20,000

228
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,260
people okay so those people when they

229
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,050
started the diskette the questionnaire

230
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,470
was was presented to them they were they

231
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,850
were responding the questionnaire and

232
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,570
then after nine-year eboot this this

233
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,700
screen would be presented to them and on

234
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,590
that screen it says that he sent the

235
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,710
people my personal needs to send 189

236
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:28,150
dollars to our p o-- box in panama so

237
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,860
that was the first delivery method in

238
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,000
the way that they got paid and then in

239
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,780
the year 2000 when everybody was i was

240
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,590
worried about the the year 2000 bug we

241
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,020
had a couple of what they call fake

242
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,940
avian performance enhancement tools

243
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,310
those were mostly likely distributed to

244
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,860
torrent sites or our websites or

245
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,440
drive-by downloads where you

246
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,959
would install something that would

247
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,370
theoretically enhance the performance of

248
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,709
your of your computer and when you ran

249
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:01,779
it it was like oh I found a bunch of

250
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:04,389
issues in your computer and if they

251
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:06,339
didn't actually find anything there was

252
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:09,129
nothing they would actually make

253
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:11,110
something break something in order for

254
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,029
you to to make sure that you you pay

255
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:16,930
them right so obviously this was

256
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,439
initially a small fee around 32 to $100

257
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:22,389
and obviously they didn't fix anything

258
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:28,290
right so in 20 2006 it was the birth of

259
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:33,910
ransomware as we know it so the the

260
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,970
first the first ransom works you

261
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,550
actually use public could keep

262
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,689
cryptography to carry out its encryption

263
00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:47,379
so there was no actual way to via the

264
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:51,069
decryption process to recover the the

265
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:57,009
plain tests so but even though even

266
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:00,180
though it it was employing very very

267
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,779
potent cryptography most of these most

268
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:06,839
of these mowers were riddled with bugs

269
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,500
the GP code in Iraq chivos had hundreds

270
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,370
of issues on their code so if I remember

271
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,949
correctly actually vales actually didn't

272
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:20,560
overwrite the file it deleted so you

273
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,720
will be able to undelete it and there

274
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,110
was some other issues with GP code where

275
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,290
even if you if you were able to get the

276
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,120
private decryption key to decrypt files

277
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,220
there was there were errors in the

278
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,230
decryption routine where they were what

279
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,850
are able to actually and decrypt the

280
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,339
file so they were pretty pretty buggy

281
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:45,069
and it was most mainly by individuals

282
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:47,199
were like just realizing the power of

283
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,509
the these two and what could it be used

284
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:50,910
for

285
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,670
and then 27 2013

286
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,100
cryptolocker came along and it was a

287
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,029
quip it was a attacked that was mainly

288
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:04,060
delivered via email and exploded

289
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,350
from five of September to late May 2014

290
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,530
it typically propagated as an attachment

291
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:15,010
to a similes seemingly innocuous email

292
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,220
message which actually looks like it was

293
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,840
sent from a legitimate company most

294
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,010
likely this the individual behind this

295
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:28,330
threat will have had a network of spam

296
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,850
bots who were actually sending those

297
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,940
from my actual company so he could feel

298
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,310
more enticing and more real so that we

299
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:40,150
would be more prone to open that so it

300
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,850
contains a zip file and sometimes a PD

301
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,910
an executable file but with the

302
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,480
extension as a PDF so it was gonna be

303
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,850
like invoice dot PDF DX dad

304
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,780
exe dot PDF so it was it was look like a

305
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,480
PDF but it was actually wasn't a PDF

306
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,130
obviously so this was distributed by a

307
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,870
well-known botnet called GAMEOVER Zeus

308
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:09,160
and it was the first creep ransomware to

309
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,590
actually demand the ransom to be paid in

310
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,750
Bitcoin with Meiji made it explode at

311
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:19,030
that time some some reports say that

312
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,000
they netted close to 27 million dollars

313
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,020
it was the first very lucrative

314
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:30,270
ransomware operation to date and in 2014

315
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:34,240
FBI via operation Tovar was able to

316
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,600
crack down a couple of their of their

317
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,000
network and servers and were able to get

318
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,220
the encryption keys so some of the

319
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,170
victims from from that Mauer were

320
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,360
actually able to recover their their

321
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,460
data without ever having to pay anything

322
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,709
[Music]

323
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,790
and one very interesting thing it

324
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,280
started using as well domain generated

325
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,520
algorithms so unless you had a solution

326
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,590
in your environment that has the ability

327
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,590
to via some kind of machine learning or

328
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,450
even statistical analysis to identify

329
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,930
that a forgiving domain is generated B

330
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,280
via domain generation algorithm

331
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,329
algorithm

332
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:18,429
you wouldn't be able to stop that threat

333
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:22,209
right so that's that's one of the things

334
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:28,089
that it had evolved into and then things

335
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:30,279
really started to pick he being picked

336
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:32,829
up by cybercriminals in 2015

337
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:35,980
crypto wall came along right and we had

338
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,799
close to five variation versions

339
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,819
iterations of that Mauer and it was it

340
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:45,459
was so huge mainly because of the way

341
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:48,369
that it was being delivered right so the

342
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:50,739
factors behind crypto wall actually

343
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:54,119
breached into a hundreds to thousands of

344
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,100
legitimate companies domains like a

345
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,149
Disney if I'm not mistaken facebook at

346
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:04,239
ad networks all of those big companies

347
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,850
that a lot of people actually navigates

348
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,189
you without giving a second thought so

349
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:10,929
what what was actually happening there

350
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,670
was they were leveraging a vulnerability

351
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,629
in Java so the victim using a vulnerable

352
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:19,600
web browser would we would browse to

353
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,259
let's say Disney comm and then on Disney

354
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:26,649
comm was kind of hacked it was hacked

355
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:29,259
and they implanted something called an

356
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:31,689
exploit kit an exploit kit actually

357
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:35,049
works profiling the browser that is

358
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:37,179
there is requesting the page from so

359
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:39,369
let's say I'm looking for a specific

360
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:41,679
Windows version with a specific browser

361
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,319
version and a specific plug-in if that

362
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:47,110
happens then it will redirect the user

363
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,540
to another page where it would be in act

364
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,509
will be exploited and the payload would

365
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:57,279
get installed into their computers of

366
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,860
course it was not it was not only via

367
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,949
what we call water-holding attacks but

368
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:10,510
also the is phishing emails and drive-by

369
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,199
downloads as well so they have a very

370
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,720
intrusive and complex network to deliver

371
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,079
those those mowers into Residex victims

372
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,439
into specific domains where the other

373
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,109
exploit kids were were actually hosted

374
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,340
so

375
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:34,530
[Music]

376
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,050
crypto wall actually had a lot of its it

377
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,630
amped the game in in a sense that it

378
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,820
started soon to hide deep into the

379
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,950
system it was the first ransomware to

380
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,430
actually employ code injection

381
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,050
techniques so once he got a foothold

382
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,990
into the system it would open up

383
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,030
explorador exe and try to hide its code

384
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,660
inside the process so it was the first

385
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,550
iteration of a malware that actually had

386
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,770
no processes running so it's by

387
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,410
basically one traits of a file s attack

388
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,990
so it executed the code as soon as was

389
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,880
able to execute it would open up an

390
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,730
other processes another projects party

391
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,640
x-ers vc host dot exe and he would try

392
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,520
to inject the code into a different

393
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,840
process so if you're looking at

394
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,850
processes you wouldn't find anything it

395
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,680
would be just a regular exploratory X

396
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:31,450
irani so that's nothing right well in

397
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,000
2016 there was the explosion of

398
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,050
ransomware as a service and that gave

399
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,980
around somewhere a very good advantage

400
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,930
and it was really something that if I

401
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:51,370
believe correctly it jumped from from I

402
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,860
think it was 300% I'm not sure about the

403
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,770
numbers but it was a gigantic jump in

404
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,160
handsomer samples but that just because

405
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,400
the the ransomware creators understand

406
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,140
that they would be they would be able to

407
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,950
cast a wider net and stay our way from

408
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:13,150
most of the of the of the investigation

409
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,610
that that is made so once somebody's is

410
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,740
one sample and when I tried to hunter is

411
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,190
actually looking at what how was that

412
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,260
malware delivered it's actually looking

413
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,110
at the infrastructure so where is this

414
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,930
maori communicating - where is his being

415
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,180
downloaded from so that part of the

416
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,520
infrastructure is not it's far away from

417
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,650
there ransomware creators right so they

418
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,860
just supply on the dark web or the deep

419
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,309
web they have this

420
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:43,100
this pages way they send they basically

421
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,649
sell what it's called malware builders

422
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:48,769
so you can specify specie parameters

423
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:51,799
like oh I wanna I wanna I wanna I want

424
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,559
these markets you have ran some of one

425
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,480
bit scoring I wanted to communicate with

426
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,700
this endpoint I wanted to use this kind

427
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,919
of cryptography so just pointing click

428
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:04,129
view on Mauer and then with that malware

429
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:07,100
in your hands were able to then deliver

430
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,679
it to a whole bunch of people so you

431
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,470
basically lower the bar so that anyone

432
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:16,789
could enter into this market to make a

433
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:19,519
quick buck right there's no need to know

434
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,250
programming at all there's no need to

435
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,139
understand cryptography you don't need

436
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,960
to do research on antivirus engines to

437
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,399
see if your virus is actually gonna be

438
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:33,980
gonna be effective or not we just you

439
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,610
just supply your affiliates with this

440
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,100
malware builder let them do the dirty

441
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,700
the dirty work and you and at the end of

442
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,799
the day you split your profits right so

443
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,500
in 2017 the that's when the s he death

444
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,559
so we had one a cry and pet here right

445
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,279
in I think it was a Friday and and 2017

446
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,730
that the when wanna cry started hitting

447
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,730
computers worldwide it was you me I was

448
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,309
using an exploit that was previously

449
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:12,620
disclosed by the NSA and had been

450
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,470
patched by Microsoft's two months before

451
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,159
and it's basically leveraging an SMB

452
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:21,470
vulnerability to get its way into the

453
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,919
networks and from there it had

454
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,490
self-replicating payload so it is it is

455
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:32,330
said most people think that the initial

456
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:37,399
infection vector was an SMB server that

457
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:40,519
was open to the Internet so most but

458
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:42,049
that's not being actually actually

459
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:46,610
confirmed so ransom worms were just

460
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,529
basically a response to people getting

461
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:51,080
wise well not so wise why we still have

462
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,290
a lot of

463
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,960
a lot of breaches that happen because

464
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,210
people aren't I even go and clicking

465
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,370
through everything but it was a response

466
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,990
to people getting wise ago about the

467
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,030
spread of traditional ransomware that

468
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,010
uses a spam social engineering and

469
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:09,030
phishing so with ransom worms you don't

470
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,970
actually need to click or do anything if

471
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,370
you have a vulnerable application if

472
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,590
you're running vulnerable web browser

473
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,020
like we've seen this it was like and

474
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,790
this is one of the most scary things

475
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,220
that we can see a zero-day vulnerability

476
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,850
on a popular browser being exploited on

477
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,310
the wild Google security researchers I

478
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:32,970
think one month ago or 145 days ago they

479
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:37,440
come across seven different iOS exploits

480
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,770
they were targeting Korean users so just

481
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,800
by visiting our website that's it you're

482
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,900
you're you are a victim already because

483
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,000
if you're running a specific vulnerable

484
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,280
version of that software all it need is

485
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,430
just communication and be the ability to

486
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,190
serve serve you pages so since you are

487
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,260
browsing to that page that's that's all

488
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,350
it takes right so it has the ability to

489
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,530
spread itself by using vulnerabilities

490
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,020
and not only from their abilities such

491
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,260
as eternal blue but also the credential

492
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:15,290
stealing so we had some instances where

493
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,540
networks were completely infected in

494
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,850
less than three minutes obviously those

495
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,220
were network that he didn't have in his

496
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,620
any segmentation or zero choice

497
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,500
architecture or anything but they were

498
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,260
actually doing credential stealing as

499
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,060
well there's a to call mimic ads written

500
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,580
by Benjamin Delphi that actually allows

501
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,030
you to steal credentials that are in

502
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,880
memory from from Windows and if you if

503
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,520
you don't actually profile your

504
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,010
environment and are you actually don't

505
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,500
have very deep visibility into your

506
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,410
network traffic and the interaction

507
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,380
between processes and the kernel very

508
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,240
advanced attacks will get through and

509
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,610
we'll be able to bridge our networks and

510
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,330
wreak havoc

511
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:07,400
so even even if you have zero trust and

512
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,910
okay I'm actually inspecting SSL traffic

513
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,520
I'm actually looking for IPS

514
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,260
vulnerabilities I have ng malware

515
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,280
between segments but if somebody is

516
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,330
credential doing credential stealing

517
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,580
that's something you will not see if

518
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,930
you're not deeply instrumenting the

519
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:32,310
operating system in 2018 gain crab came

520
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:37,200
along and over the course of six months

521
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,360
they released it five gain crab versions

522
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,320
to date was the first ransomware that

523
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,960
demanded ransom to be paid in the -

524
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,020
crypto currency and it actually utilizes

525
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,170
dns resolution via the beat top-level

526
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,760
domain that actually meant that no dns

527
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,330
server solution secure solution would be

528
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,880
able to stop it because the DNS requests

529
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,180
were being made via the blockchain so it

530
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,270
completely evaded that part of the of

531
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:14,250
the defense and it was the first malware

532
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,560
that we've seen that give us any

533
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,900
indicators that they were ruining they

534
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,970
were running something very professional

535
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,690
and well and well maintained they the

536
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,510
first version experienced a few setbacks

537
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:31,020
as the company BitDefender releases the

538
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,640
Decrypter for the earlier venation

539
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,160
versions so they were only able to

540
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,430
release the Decrypter because one one of

541
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,860
their gang crap servers got compromised

542
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,870
and BitDefender was able to get the the

543
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,860
public the private keys and was able to

544
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:52,530
send that as an update and as executable

545
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,200
for for decryption of specific victims

546
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,300
that had been affected by game crap

547
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:01,770
version 1 and 1.1 but gang crap 2.0 was

548
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,170
released on the same week that's that's

549
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,810
never been seen anywhere so we almost

550
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,270
looked like they were the release dodo

551
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:12,180
the the malware and they were looking at

552
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,940
vendors response and acting accordingly

553
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,559
very

554
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:18,470
fast okay so again crab has been

555
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,049
distributed via mucho spreading vectors

556
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:24,049
ming-lee spam emails but also exploit

557
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,809
kids and other affiliated malware

558
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:30,080
campaigns so one of the very interesting

559
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,360
things it was not the first one to do

560
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,230
this but gain crab generated one AES

561
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,019
keeper file so it did generate the

562
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:42,409
public key for encryption and the

563
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:44,509
private key for decryption but also for

564
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:46,940
every file it generated a new and new

565
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,490
AES key and it would encrypt the file

566
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,249
encrypt AES key for that file appended

567
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:55,070
to the end of the file and it would kill

568
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,080
the destroy the key from memory so there

569
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,499
was no there was no way to recover it

570
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:02,629
was even harder than just public key

571
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:09,499
encryption right almost forgot that was

572
00:27:09,499 --> 00:27:12,049
very interesting that the when you when

573
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:13,789
you are actually doing our research in

574
00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:15,379
your creating our we're obviously

575
00:27:15,379 --> 00:27:17,179
testing that model against different

576
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:19,610
antivirus engines right by but when

577
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,769
you're doing this were actually

578
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:24,070
understanded deep and internals of the

579
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:27,799
the antivirus and they got so mad

580
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:30,049
because we are most most security

581
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:31,610
companies are really fast at the primer

582
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,799
seems that they released a

583
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:37,519
proof-of-concept source code to two to

584
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,799
three graph runner ability in one of the

585
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:42,320
one of the security vendors and an lab

586
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,789
had I think it was version for Afghan

587
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:49,789
crab actually had a vulnerability for a

588
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:51,980
given and exploits to exploit a

589
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,799
vulnerability on n lab so if you ran a

590
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,350
gain crab version four on a computer

591
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,840
that had an anti-virus from n n lab it

592
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,899
would break and lab because of that

593
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:04,369
vulnerability analysts would still run

594
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:07,399
so I was the first instance or that we

595
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:10,700
really saw very edge I when mature

596
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,559
development practices being incorporated

597
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:21,470
in some our next the Robin Hood and

598
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:24,259
targeted now cyber criminals are

599
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:26,509
focusing on organizations that came that

600
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:27,110
can pay

601
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:31,250
and have the drive to do so so that's

602
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,410
mainly two things municipalities and

603
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,960
government institutions right so what

604
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,030
they do is they don't actually work the

605
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,500
same way as ransom arms where they

606
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,690
breach a network and go scanning

607
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,070
everybody and exploiting everybody

608
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,840
making a huge mess in a lot of a lot of

609
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,390
noise they actually breached the network

610
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,549
and try to blend in with the traffic

611
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:52,010
trying to identify potential systems and

612
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,470
understand if you if the network that

613
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:57,580
was breached is a network from let's say

614
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,440
wasteman maze management or traffic

615
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,540
lights management for a given city

616
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,570
something that would make that intrusion

617
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:09,799
very very lucrative for them so right

618
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:12,049
now these attacks have started in FM one

619
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:14,299
is taken in May close to 200

620
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:16,340
municipalities have been targeted so far

621
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,049
and that's just a few of them Washington

622
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:23,990
gar few country Jackson County Airport

623
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:29,330
Augusta about city of Baltimore so all

624
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,820
of them or were breached there's a

625
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,340
couple of them in in Canada as well and

626
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:39,290
I think it was this week I think it was

627
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:42,169
this week there was a company in Spain

628
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:45,470
that was breached as well and we were

629
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,620
able to understand that the attack was

630
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,929
very targeted because once they

631
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:53,660
encrypted the files the extension was

632
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,390
the name of the company let speak so

633
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:03,140
let's speak so I feel things that

634
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:07,280
actually gives us the chills marred and

635
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,429
there anything else if we this I think

636
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:12,410
it was from the Ponemon Institute sorry

637
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,240
I forgot to supporting the other source

638
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,360
half of 600 survey several perfections

639
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,620
do not believe that their provenance

640
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,780
prepare a proprietary power ransomware

641
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,030
attack that means they have no zero

642
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,010
trust they are not instrumenting the

643
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:27,200
their operating systems they don't have

644
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,480
any type of data analytics or cm

645
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,760
solutions so they are just there driving

646
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,790
a car on a snowy road with their folly

647
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,290
windows right that's basically what's

648
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,049
happening

649
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:41,249
and this is even more scary almost 80%

650
00:30:41,249 --> 00:30:42,960
of companies infected we ransomware

651
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,029
we're running up to date and point

652
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:48,210
protection so that that that says

653
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:52,440
something right that's not enough and

654
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,429
you we're actually seeing I have I have

655
00:30:56,429 --> 00:30:58,739
access to our credit telemetry systems

656
00:30:58,739 --> 00:31:00,389
within Friday night and we can actually

657
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:03,210
see that the numbers have going down

658
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,489
dramatically like ninety percent of the

659
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,679
of the volume of the hand somewhere is

660
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,659
gone but now the attacks are more

661
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:14,450
devastating and they're more focused so

662
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,429
the shifter hamster they be increasing

663
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:19,559
ly making the crypto more decryption

664
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:22,169
more difficult as I explained in gang

665
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:24,239
crap they're not only making use of

666
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:26,730
public key cryptography but asymmetric

667
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,889
cryptography as well per file so it's

668
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,989
absolutely impossible to recover this

669
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,269
file and this is true for all threats

670
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:35,429
that they were seeing they do not cease

671
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:38,009
to innovate and shift in order to avoid

672
00:31:38,009 --> 00:31:40,139
detection and carry its intent without

673
00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:44,220
raising any alarms so this makes this

674
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,840
makes detection very difficult

675
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,820
especially with the way that antivirus

676
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,059
companies are doing right now obviously

677
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:53,369
as I explained it before the use of new

678
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,109
languages make it more difficult to

679
00:31:55,109 --> 00:31:57,059
catch because if you're even if you're

680
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:58,440
using machine learning if you're doing

681
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,509
lists and a static and dynamic analysis

682
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:03,749
if you're feeling ransomware that was

683
00:32:03,749 --> 00:32:06,330
written in C Python in Java and then

684
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,009
there's a ransomware written in go

685
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,289
that's it you want boy won't be able to

686
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:13,320
catch it even if you're running machine

687
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,529
learning solutions on top of that well

688
00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:18,690
we really think that the next focus will

689
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,789
be high profile individuals operating

690
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:23,639
technologies in mobile just because

691
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:25,710
there's a lot of our lifes are in our

692
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,929
mobile right now I have my token or my

693
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:31,710
finances are here so and I do believe

694
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:34,499
that if they make it ransomware with

695
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:36,720
just ten or ten or fifteen dollars

696
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,840
everybody would pay because nobody would

697
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,149
would will risk it yeah increasingly

698
00:32:45,149 --> 00:32:47,549
compacts mixing behavior to 3kv engines

699
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,799
as I said knew that new languages are

700
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:50,660
one of

701
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,340
one of the ways that they can get

702
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,700
through it

703
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,960
distribution vectors we've talked about

704
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,870
this mainly in attachments in emails but

705
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,080
not only attachments links as well

706
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,290
social engineering since 30 years ago

707
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:12,140
still happening right that happens a lot

708
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,960
especially when you're receiving an

709
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,580
email from a company that you do

710
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,950
business with that's that seems to be

711
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,559
most of the cases now before deploying

712
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:24,170
ransomware these guys behind it they try

713
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,880
to understand the companies understand

714
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,190
which are the partners and try to breach

715
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,620
some of the partners to send you an

716
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,570
email from that partner to make it more

717
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:36,100
enticing for you to open up that email

718
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,250
drive-by downloads exploit kids and I

719
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,100
hope obviously there was one mower that

720
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,130
actually was able to utilize one

721
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,679
function of I think he was Microsoft

722
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:51,770
Office why just by hovering the mouse on

723
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,360
top of a link was able to trigger

724
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,490
something triggered a payload download

725
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,860
so there's there's a ton of tricks right

726
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,740
and obviously in it which mainly bugs

727
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,440
right if you have a bug there's that's

728
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,510
it there's nothing else you can do other

729
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:09,609
than patch so how does it actually work

730
00:34:09,609 --> 00:34:12,080
considering that we're exploiting a

731
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,199
vulnerability on a browser so let's say

732
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,770
we receive an email with a link to your

733
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,918
to our bank in this case the Citibank

734
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,810
but it should be Citibank but you are

735
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,129
not actually paying attention because

736
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:28,399
it's urgent right and then you fire up

737
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,000
your Firefox it's gonna go to that

738
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,219
socially engineered site the social

739
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:36,260
engineer sites I would have an exploit

740
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,840
kit on it or just a single vulnerability

741
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,389
it will profile your Firefox or your

742
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:43,668
running windows and we have a vulnerable

743
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:45,980
version of Java then you would exploit

744
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,350
that vulnerability would call PowerShell

745
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,810
execute only in memory so there's no

746
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:54,230
traces or no artifacts whatsoever which

747
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:57,170
is mainly what today's 70 or 80 percent

748
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,030
of antivirus companies are doing they're

749
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,940
looking for things on disk still they're

750
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,960
not actually doing any

751
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,790
that that's about to change because

752
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:08,520
Microsoft has released advanced malware

753
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,310
scan interface that actually makes you

754
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,320
able to plug into the memory address

755
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,740
space of MSHDA powershell and other and

756
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,740
other and other avenues of attacks for

757
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,460
this for these mowers and then boom you

758
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,740
are part of a botnet right so as I said

759
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,690
recent born solar attacks are ready

760
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,870
really really targeted make sure that

761
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,510
they deploy Mauer to a network that they

762
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:39,150
know it is it is gonna pay or if not

763
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,830
gonna pay they're gonna have huge

764
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:44,550
impacts everything needs to believe that

765
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:47,790
the initial vector is not via RDP some

766
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,740
some researchers said it would but most

767
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,220
of them do not agree on that on that

768
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:56,130
that part in wheels inside the network

769
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,620
it behaves like a ransom word but not as

770
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,470
hectic right it's trying to jump for

771
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,840
systems to systems looking for systems

772
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,700
that are have actual value and have

773
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,790
actual date data that the given

774
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,500
municipality or government institution

775
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,140
needs to carry on this it's business

776
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,600
it's different to completely shut down a

777
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,820
company it's another whole other issue

778
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,680
to completely shut down City and they

779
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,530
know it

780
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:25,620
so municipalities in school are being

781
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,810
targeted in Maryland Georgia New York

782
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,900
Tennessee and Florida ten thousand

783
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,130
computers affected in the mouth

784
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,820
Baltimore and the ransom that they are

785
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,340
demanding is basically one Bitcoin per

786
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,160
computer or 13 bitcoins for our whole

787
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,240
environment but of course they did not

788
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,860
negotiate with terrorists right so

789
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,200
they're I think they took them three

790
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,360
months to completely to completely get

791
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,960
there for structure on on its tracks

792
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,060
where it was and they took eighteen

793
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,370
millions in damages whereas if they were

794
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,050
to pay the ransom it would be like a

795
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,460
hundred thousand dollars or something

796
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,830
like that but they know I'm gonna I'm

797
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,360
gonna do it from scratch but they are

798
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,700
correct there's no there is no there's

799
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,790
you won't be you there's there's no

800
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,290
guarantee that you're gonna have the

801
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,090
public key or that the decryption would

802
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:22,120
work so it might as well throw $100,000

803
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,660
on the garbage make sure that you have

804
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,050
security in place before right so eight

805
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,700
million won or lost in revenue ten

806
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,070
million recovery costs and recovery will

807
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,750
take months if you're not if you don't

808
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,540
do backup if you don't have zero trust

809
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,340
or anything in your environment and you

810
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,200
actually didn't know where it started or

811
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,880
where it has ended so one very good

812
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,910
thing that you guys could do to make

813
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:51,820
sure that you are on from the front and

814
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,100
then you are at least clear some of the

815
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,700
fog on your car is focusing on my dirty

816
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,290
TPS a lot of people talk about

817
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:02,110
indications of chrome compromise well or

818
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,580
indication of compromise means that

819
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,110
something is very rarely really really

820
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,430
bad in your environment and you should

821
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,680
act accordingly but if you are focusing

822
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,260
on indicator indicators indicators of

823
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,900
action you may actually be able to stop

824
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,480
that tracked on its tracks but in order

825
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,140
to do that you must be able to be

826
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,760
instrumenting the operating system so if

827
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,790
you guys don't have the actual budget to

828
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,890
go and buy a deep behavior analytic

829
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,710
solution or by deception technology

830
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,630
which is amazing because it changes the

831
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,240
economics of the attack so instead of

832
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,840
there they attack and it needs to be

833
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,450
wrong right one time it needs to be

834
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,100
right all the time for the attack to

835
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,620
succeed right so making sure that you

836
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,380
are you're you're looking at TTP's and

837
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,890
you are doing a proactive returns in

838
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,930
your unknown environment it's one of the

839
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,700
ways to go so recommendations

840
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,900
segmentation of course especially for

841
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,110
ransom worms if you're have the HR

842
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,730
department separated from the IT

843
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,500
department separated from the financial

844
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,630
department making sure that we have

845
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,550
inspection or all of those environments

846
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,030
you will be able to at least understand

847
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,980
that there is something wrong moving

848
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:18,100
from one domain to another backup data

849
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,740
of course and patching

850
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,880
of course recommendation security

851
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,700
mindset it's it is there's a couple of a

852
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,770
lot of companies actually that actually

853
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:35,280
do fishing on demand so be sure to

854
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,869
accommodate that into your security

855
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:40,089
mindset and set up setting up for

856
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:42,670
controller drills there are tractors

857
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,320
trying through beach showing defenses

858
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,270
right now why don't you do the same

859
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,940
right try to breach try to see what's

860
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,790
going on how your how your processes

861
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,800
stand up i or technology is able to

862
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,900
detect that because if you don't most

863
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,000
likely if you're not breached already

864
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,210
you will you know in a short period of

865
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,760
time and focus on TTP's right making

866
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,710
sure that you're looking not only for

867
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:08,140
indicators of compromise which are very

868
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,160
useful but actual indicators of actions

869
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,290
every every move that an attacker must

870
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:16,990
make and and mightier attack framework

871
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:19,150
actually has a bunch of them already

872
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,890
laid out i'll have to do is get those

873
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,030
informations into your trial

874
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,830
intelligence platforms making sure that

875
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,390
you have instrumented your operating

876
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:29,220
system so you can match all of those

877
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,690
well recovery from an attack

878
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,180
imagine that have not nothing in your

879
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,450
company is working so all-hands-on-deck

880
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,650
making sure that you are able to

881
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,810
recreate all the processes recreate all

882
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,849
the systems mostly the data won't be

883
00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:46,780
there but you have to to make sure that

884
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,690
everybody is on the same room it's

885
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,390
trying to basically build the the

886
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,060
business from scratch right so it's

887
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,770
important to have a list of contacts

888
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:58,510
like lawyers vendors and system

889
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,550
integrators to make sure that you

890
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:03,010
understand what what is the message that

891
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,510
you're going to you're going to come

892
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,820
across and what information can be used

893
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,369
to try to recover some of the some of

894
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:12,060
your infrastructure

895
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:26,979
