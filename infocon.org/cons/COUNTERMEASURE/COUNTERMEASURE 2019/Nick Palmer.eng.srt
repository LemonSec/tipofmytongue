2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,010
as current mentioned I'll be

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,809
representing group IB and actually

4
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:11,190
presenting some of the research that our

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,889
team has done we actually wanted to and

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,260
always do want to present some relative

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,180
research for the market that we're

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,619
speaking in so we had wanted to present

9
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,910
some apt research connected to Canada

10
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,410
some of the guys were disappointed when

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,970
we switched last minute but we'll share

12
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,680
the details with you may be offline over

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,140
a beer and I think you know relative to

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,969
to this story as well of how I ended up

15
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,760
in Moscow but today what we'll do is

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,890
talk a little bit about something

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,870
related to to the Canadian market and

18
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,579
that's our investigation into the

19
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,280
carding form called Brian's Club so the

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,899
title of my presentation is payment

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,180
theft to montez's monetization excuse me

22
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,989
and a competitive marketplace so Brian's

23
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:53,610
club for those of you who don't know was

24
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,960
and still is a fairly large carding form

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,180
early in October of this year and a

26
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,149
little bit earlier for us a threat actor

27
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,650
named mr. green who we'll talk about a

28
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,049
little bit later actually released about

29
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,930
27 million cards to various cyber

30
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,780
security companies and famous Brian

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,549
Krebs as you see here the carding form

32
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,040
was named after so that these cards

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,540
could be you know released to the

34
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,240
community and then onwards to you know

35
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,710
organizations who could take care of

36
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,939
that upon receiving this information

37
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,979
obviously for us very interesting to

38
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,439
investigate we provided it to two

39
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,270
Canadian government and some of the

40
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,590
financial institutions so that they

41
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,380
could take care of some of the problems

42
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,210
and yeah so that's what we'll talk about

43
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,850
today in terms of the compromised data

44
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,130
that that we identified here you can see

45
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,890
actually on the screen what our internal

46
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,170
system looks like and how we identify

47
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,579
some of the payment card details that

48
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,040
have been compromised in total there was

49
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,649
26 million just over I think 27 million

50
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:55,680
credit cards that were on the shop if

51
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,530
you put that value of about $500 that

52
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,000
different organizations do to each

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,219
payment card compromise the shop value

54
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,590
was was quite large in terms of full

55
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,060
card information was there that's

56
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,940
information about the credit card number

57
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,250
CBB information perhaps name of the car

58
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,190
holder that was about 800,000 in terms

59
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,040
of the full card information is about

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,840
21,000 and in terms of Canadian dumps

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,340
making it relevant for you guys it was

62
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,740
about half a million in total so dumps

63
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,710
would have the track data so ability to

64
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,440
actually reprint cards using the

65
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,390
magnetic strip information that was

66
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,140
siphoned off

67
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,970
usually this is compromised through

68
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,180
posts post malware or skimming devices

69
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,450
or something that can collect that

70
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,610
magnetic strip data so we'll take a

71
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,530
closer look at some of the sellers of

72
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,310
the dumps in terms of different actors

73
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,420
that were selling them so one actor test

74
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,060
7000 is responsible for about 12% of the

75
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,400
different dumps krebs being one of the

76
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,350
earliest actors on this carding form

77
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,250
about 10% and others you know very

78
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,930
minority in terms of the contribution to

79
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,930
that carding form in terms of Canadian

80
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,970
dumps obviously Krebs is is much more

81
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,680
interested in has a higher percentage of

82
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,489
those Canadian dumps at about 32% to car

83
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:19,330
with 15% and Ronaldo had 13% if we start

84
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,190
to look at the sellers of cards now it

85
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,410
starts to become more interesting so a

86
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,010
via card 777 was responsible for about

87
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,200
74% of the cards being sold on Bryan's

88
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,680
Club and SS silver responsible for about

89
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,780
17% and we'll take a look more about

90
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,209
these actors later on when we break this

91
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,160
down into the sellers of Canadian cards

92
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,829
you can see that s the silver

93
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:45,280
responsible for 38% and a via card 777

94
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,370
responsible for about 56% and we started

95
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,650
to profile these actors as we go along

96
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,450
in the presentation so if you don't know

97
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,450
how a card shop actually works you know

98
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,010
obviously there there's the shop where

99
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,480
all of the carding information can be

100
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,370
available for sale there's the buyers

101
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,870
who would like to buy credit card

102
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,579
information and use it for malicious

103
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:05,560
purposes the owner of the shop obviously

104
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,570
collecting you know commissions from

105
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,310
some of the sales going on and then

106
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,750
there's individual sellers that will

107
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,280
compromise you know a few thousand

108
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,329
credit cards and then there'll be

109
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:15,910
resellers that actually collect this

110
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,970
information from individual or minor

111
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,440
minor sellers and actually resell that

112
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,729
on to to the shop and a via card and SS

113
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:25,650
silver were two

114
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,259
the main resellers on Bryan's Club the

115
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:30,199
Avia card was responsible for about

116
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,900
600,000 cards in total 35,000 of those

117
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,240
related to dumps 11 thousand of them

118
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,120
related to Canadian cards and 69 related

119
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,910
to Canadian dump information SS silver

120
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,190
again a large reseller on the Bryan's

121
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,389
Club market 137 cards in total there was

122
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:51,870
22,000 dumps in total for him about 8% a

123
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,940
give or take of Canadian cards

124
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,810
represented of that figure and 265

125
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,820
Canadian dumps for that so we started to

126
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,620
look a little bit more into the

127
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,850
different profiles that would be

128
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,220
relative to to the Canadian market so a

129
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,160
via card has been a seller of dumps and

130
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,750
cards on multiple different underground

131
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,080
forms since at least 2015 and as we

132
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,520
mentioned on previous slides he was

133
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,820
responsible for about 600,000 cards in

134
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,830
total with 11,000 of those represented

135
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:25,410
to Canadian cards in terms of SS silver

136
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,610
he was reseller as well since about 2015

137
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,020
early we know that he's a

138
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,729
russian-speaking actor from some of the

139
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:35,699
underground forms that he poses on we

140
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,919
did identify some use of online gambling

141
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,800
sites to actually siphon off money into

142
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,360
these sites and and launder it through

143
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,860
them he was responsible for about

144
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,970
137,000 payment card details with a

145
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,880
thousand of those relative to Canadian

146
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,310
institutions so we started to look and

147
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,110
hunt for different online monikers that

148
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,720
connected back to SS silver here you can

149
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,599
see different monikers that connect back

150
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:04,050
to SS silver so Yvonne Evanovich which

151
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,050
is like John Smith and English different

152
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,090
email addresses and telegram connected

153
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,070
back to that which introduced to other

154
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,039
actors we did manage to connect the

155
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,960
telegram account back to another actor

156
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,349
called

157
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:18,720
another moniker excuse me called our

158
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,810
gold which led us to different emails

159
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,130
you can see one of them is actually

160
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,860
called uber service and so from this

161
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,630
uber service email we were able to

162
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,699
identify different posts on underground

163
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,770
forums connected to this email about how

164
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,990
he's actually starting to to monetize

165
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,159
some of those stolen credit card

166
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,599
information maybe that he doesn't sell

167
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:38,760
so he has one service that he actually

168
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,470
off

169
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,690
through uber so here you can see a post

170
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,090
in Russian he's actually offering free

171
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,270
rides or for a very small cost on uber

172
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,300
in Moscow SPB would be st. Petersburg

173
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,699
ekb would be a cat named Berg in Russia

174
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,030
but also offers this type of service in

175
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,110
the US market

176
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,050
EU and UK so this is one of his fronts

177
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,180
for actually monetizing some of the

178
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,979
credit-card information that he collects

179
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:06,900
so now let's take a look at some of the

180
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,449
sellers of dump information so you can

181
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,039
see all of them listed here and we'll go

182
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,680
through them kind of step by step krebs

183
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,009
Takara Rinaldo appear and we profiled

184
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:18,840
some of the ones that we actually were

185
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,099
able to garner some of the information

186
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:23,099
from so krebs he was one of the first

187
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,139
registered on Brian's Club shop so when

188
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,300
we went in to actually the shop and

189
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,259
started to look at some of the

190
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,090
information that was hosted there he had

191
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,970
one of the earliest numbers for user

192
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,620
names within that carting shop so we

193
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,500
know that either he's one of the

194
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,150
accounts for the shop owners or the shop

195
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,360
owner itself excuse me he also had

196
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,060
access to API access so we wouldn't

197
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,500
actually have to visit the shop he could

198
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,810
just automatically put the information

199
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,000
on to the shop in an automated fashion

200
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,909
Pier he was specifically interested in

201
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,469
Canadian dumps so if you want to conduct

202
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:00,360
some further investigations on this I'll

203
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,130
supply you know our report and

204
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,599
presentation afterwards so he was

205
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,969
responsible for about 86,000 dumps on

206
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:08,069
the carding shop and forty four thousand

207
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:09,479
of those relative to Canadian

208
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,699
institutions he was also particularly

209
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,740
interesting because we found a couple of

210
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,690
posts on Underground's where he was

211
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,539
looking for RDP access to different post

212
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:23,370
malware or sorry post systems like like

213
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,460
micro system for example from Oracle so

214
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,199
he could be you know an actor who's

215
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,389
looking for access to different post

216
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:33,089
systems within Canada and then shipping

217
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:34,380
that information off to two different

218
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:41,250
carding forms that he actual traits best

219
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,289
fresh another actor that was selling

220
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,790
dumped information english-speaking

221
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,040
actor he had been actually removed from

222
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,750
a number of different carting shops

223
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,920
without any explanation but also

224
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,320
high high percentage of information

225
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,730
connected back to Canadian dumped

226
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,630
information test 7000 was one of the

227
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,340
largest providers of dumps but a lesser

228
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,100
percentage as focused on to to Canada we

229
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,660
did do some further research on to

230
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,510
phishing kits and looking for his email

231
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,310
accounts and monikers connected to that

232
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,990
and did detect that he was conducting

233
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,140
some phishing attacks into PayPal with

234
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,710
in 2014 then we did some further

235
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,390
analysis on the cards we wanted to try

236
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,100
to find out you know is this information

237
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,110
coming from one different source or

238
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,940
another one of the things that we

239
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,380
actually learned in the last couple of

240
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,870
years to identify different maybe issues

241
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,340
that are happening within the financial

242
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,020
sector is to actually monitor the

243
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,580
information that's being posted on

244
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,640
underground form so for example we can

245
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,250
connected an incident to Lazarus in

246
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,290
Pakistan actually this year it's public

247
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,880
knowledge you can you can google it and

248
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,220
we were researching underground forms

249
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,870
and and quite frankly it's like zero

250
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,610
zero zero every month and then all of

251
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,740
the sudden you know two hundred thousand

252
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,320
cards posted in in one in one go and

253
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,570
oftentimes that's an indicator you know

254
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,250
to do further research for the financial

255
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,080
sector and and potentially understand if

256
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,050
there's some payment gateway or maybe

257
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,990
large post malware infection etc so we

258
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,870
actually did some some research into the

259
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,120
cards we do a lot of research into

260
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,780
different JavaScript sniffers these are

261
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,090
essentially guesses that would be

262
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,020
installed in different ecommerce

263
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,970
websites to steal payment card details

264
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,550
and our analysts will identify the gates

265
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,440
of these different JavaScript sniffers

266
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,660
and as a result identified the payment

267
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,310
card details that have been compromised

268
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,470
and we actually identified that there

269
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,390
was quite a large crossover between a

270
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:38,010
via card 777 and as silver two different

271
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,310
Java strip sniffer families through our

272
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,890
analysis so a via card as you remember

273
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,180
was one of those that focused on

274
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,660
Canadian dumps had about 111 cards that

275
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,910
were the same so it could be you know

276
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,380
that they were compromised twice not

277
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,470
necessarily that definitive and then

278
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,290
they were the same as a JavaScript

279
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,540
actor well the criminal actor that

280
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,070
manages the JavaScript that we call

281
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,829
coffee moco but SS silver on the other

282
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:06,889
hand had about two thousand sixty nine

283
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:10,199
which were the exact same and also

284
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:13,649
compromised by coffee moco so then we

285
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:17,370
started to look into when were they

286
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,889
compromised first and maybe just to give

287
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:21,180
you a little bit more background for

288
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,279
those of you who might not know just

289
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,610
information about JavaScript sniffers so

290
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,680
if you've you know read the media they

291
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,630
are happening more and more

292
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,850
you know British Airways was one of the

293
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,430
first websites to be compromised by

294
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,430
Jennifers and you know thousands upon

295
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,720
thousands of credit card information

296
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,639
from those customers were were then

297
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,250
compromised so this has become you know

298
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,899
a particular area of interest for group

299
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:49,019
I'd be to research and to identify data

300
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,319
that can be exfiltrated by compromising

301
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:54,269
different ecommerce websites so you can

302
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:56,250
see with this type of malicious code

303
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,500
installed in an e-commerce website they

304
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,149
could get information about the bank

305
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:02,610
card numbers names address logs and

306
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,410
login and passwords or any other

307
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,610
information that they'd like to

308
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,380
exfiltrate from that specific user

309
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,649
session in terms of how the cyber

310
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:12,899
criminal actually manages the JavaScript

311
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,389
sniffer it's typically hard to track

312
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:16,500
these and they can use multiple

313
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,350
different gates but they will infect an

314
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,519
e-commerce website they will do so by

315
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,899
exploiting different content management

316
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:27,779
system software that haven't been

317
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,760
patched for example upload their

318
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,860
JavaScript and start to send or siphon

319
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,750
off payment card details to their

320
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,990
JavaScript sniffer gates and then onward

321
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,940
to their administrative panels where the

322
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,860
cyber criminal can then actually collect

323
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,920
the money so then we started to look at

324
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,290
okay you know we have cards that were

325
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,180
both compromised on Brian's Club shop

326
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,180
and also cards that were compromised by

327
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,310
the javascript is sniffer a criminal

328
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,350
group that we call coffee moco so we

329
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,089
looked at the two groups that were

330
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:59,279
relative to Canadian institutions a v8

331
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,459
card 777 for the most part all of the

332
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:05,069
cards were compromised first on Bryan's

333
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:07,649
club but 39% of the cards that we

334
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:10,320
analyzed were first on coffee

335
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,210
but when we looked at actually SS

336
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,810
Silver's cards actually 80 88 percent of

337
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,570
all of the cards that were all that were

338
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,740
compromised through both of these

339
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,610
sources and and both on Brian's Club as

340
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,090
well

341
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,830
we're actually compromised by coffee

342
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,600
moco first which kind of led us to

343
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,240
believe that SS silver was perhaps using

344
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,480
Brian's Club as you know way to monetize

345
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,780
some of his jazz sniffer operations

346
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,840
which was an interesting finding for us

347
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,130
here's actually a screenshot of what

348
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,310
some of the office gated code for coffee

349
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,320
moco's jazz sniffer on the top left-hand

350
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,540
corner and the D office gated code on

351
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,610
the bottom left-hand corner and actually

352
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,290
that would be you know some of the file

353
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,330
paths and places once you actually

354
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,850
identify the the gate for that J s

355
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,500
sniffer where the cybercriminal will

356
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,810
store the information from some of the

357
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,760
payment guard card details that he has

358
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:08,520
actually compromised in terms of this

359
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,890
being you know a threat for you know

360
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,220
Canadian institutions and consumers not

361
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,160
only Canadian we see it becoming a you

362
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,600
know a bigger threat a more and more

363
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,850
coffee moco group in particular they've

364
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,330
infected at least 526 online stores that

365
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,220
that we know about it could be much more

366
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,190
since January of 2019 and they've

367
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,930
compromised more than three hundred

368
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,210
forty thousand payment card details or

369
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:36,300
cards from their operations and they

370
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,490
actually we found out through the

371
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,190
analysis launched their own card shop at

372
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,310
the beginning of 2019 as well and we're

373
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,410
perhaps using Brian's club as it was

374
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,030
much more popular than the card shop

375
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,620
that they just launched to actually

376
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,110
monetize the cards until their carding

377
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,420
shop become became excuse me more

378
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,880
popular and then they would start to

379
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,170
siphon off their information to that in

380
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,460
terms of some of the incidents that

381
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,470
coffee moco was actually responsible for

382
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,330
there's many of them but one of the most

383
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,760
famous is this has Abbey Sotheby's home

384
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,100
online store excuse me which they

385
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,680
compromised in December of 2017 when

386
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,020
were actually siphoning off payment card

387
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,040
details from Sotheby's so this is

388
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,770
actually the shop that coffee moco

389
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,520
launched

390
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,860
so this is an interesting finding for us

391
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,450
through through this analysis when they

392
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,930
launched it in 2019 you know it wasn't

393
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,700
as popular that's why we believe that

394
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,380
there was a crossover from Brian's club

395
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,540
to some of the JavaScript sniffer

396
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,000
compromises earlier on but we believe

397
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,430
that they actually launched this karting

398
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,950
shop to monetize the information with

399
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,020
less Commission than they were doing

400
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,149
before for example so how did this

401
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:49,770
actually all happen in the first place

402
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,500
how did this information become you know

403
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,860
publicly or semi publicly available so a

404
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,190
gentleman named mr. green actually as he

405
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,930
called himself had a little bit of

406
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,820
trouble on the battlefield he's

407
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,130
presumably the individual responsible

408
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,709
for this leak and we started to gather

409
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:09,330
more information about that through

410
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,730
public source so krebs was contacted by

411
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,220
this individual and numerous post on

412
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,010
underground forums by cyber criminals

413
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,920
where they posted his information online

414
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,750
you can see his jabber IDs email

415
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,660
addresses etc and started to provide

416
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,520
more information about him actually be a

417
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,500
ripper and being a ripper

418
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,300
so he actually got shunned from the

419
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,980
community you know all the cyber

420
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,690
criminals pretty much knew that he was

421
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,000
the one that provided the details to not

422
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,060
only group IB and Brian Krebs but there

423
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,910
was also digital shadows I believe who

424
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,400
received some of this information and in

425
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,750
the bottom right hand corner it might be

426
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,790
difficult to see for you but here's the

427
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,529
post where they actually provide all of

428
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:51,810
his information that was available

429
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,089
online so other cyber criminals can

430
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:55,740
start to conduct investigation and of

431
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,560
course law enforcement could also start

432
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,120
to conduct investigations from this

433
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,940
information the motivation for him

434
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,369
certainly was that he was opening up his

435
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:08,099
own carding form so here you can see

436
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,319
some of the posts in October almost

437
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,300
exactly when this information became

438
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,699
available when he's starting to announce

439
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,849
that he's launching a carding form so

440
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,380
definitely trouble on the on the

441
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,869
battlefield for for him so if you'd like

442
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,849
to learn more information about some of

443
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:25,640
the investigations that we conducted

444
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,959
certainly I can answer questions that

445
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,850
you have here or we can provide the full

446
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,530
report to you know all of the

447
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,560
countermeasures attendees today and

448
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,060
I'd be happy to do that you can just

449
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,680
email me and provide you any more

450
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,780
information that you'd like thank you

451
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,010
