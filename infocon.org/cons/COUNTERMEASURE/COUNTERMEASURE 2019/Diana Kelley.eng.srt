[Music]

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,370
I'm gonna be talking about two different

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,230
things one is I'm going to be talking

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,300
about the research from the Microsoft

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,969
security intelligence report and what we

6
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,800
found in the last version of it which

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,109
was version 24 and then I'm also going

8
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,180
to talk a little bit about what we can

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,130
do to modernize the security operation

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,660
center using something called data

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,050
gravity so let's get started with the

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,670
security intelligence report how many

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,380
people have ever even heard of the

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,969
security intelligence report from

15
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,760
Microsoft okay that's great a few hands

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,760
it's similar to the Verizon dibber the

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,950
data breach incident report you probably

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,480
have heard of the Verizon report right

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,570
many many people have we do a report

20
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,579
like that well but we actually take our

21
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,760
own data and obviously Verizon takes

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,250
their data we take our data and a lot of

23
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,629
our data I'll explain where it comes

24
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,789
from but we have a different set of data

25
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,920
and different view into what we see

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,280
going on around the net it and we put

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,159
this out once a year and this is

28
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,049
actually it takes us a full year to go

29
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:08,670
through the analysis to find the right

30
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,650
stories because we see a lot of

31
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,740
information at any given time but just

32
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,689
because you see one spike here once back

33
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:16,890
there that doesn't mean it's got

34
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,659
statistical significance it doesn't mean

35
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,240
it's actually a trend so what we do in

36
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,400
our blogs if we see a really big change

37
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,680
in a tactic or a technique or a new

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,299
piece of malware we'll write it up

39
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,340
immediately but then when we come to the

40
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,869
end of the year and we do our full

41
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:32,970
intelligence report right up we try and

42
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,759
find some really big narratives in order

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,430
to give you guys a view into some of the

44
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,009
big big changes that are going on and

45
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,079
hopefully to help you have some insights

46
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,979
into how you can address them so in

47
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,680
version 24 that we had ransomware versus

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,700
cryptocurrency

49
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,979
phishing attacks is anybody looking at

50
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,990
this and going like oh my god phishing

51
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,360
why why are you talking about phishing

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,090
isn't it you know almost 20/20 haven't

53
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,049
we had haven't we done it to death well

54
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:07,910
we we've all heard about it is it solved

55
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,560
no it's still the number one attack

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,629
vector so that's why it's coming back up

57
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,680
again and

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,719
supply-chain compromises which I know we

59
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,590
had a full full keynote on earlier so

60
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,629
where do we get our information what

61
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:23,730
what is our information from it's from a

62
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,859
sure it's from around our data centers

63
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:28,709
around the world and and for the office

64
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:30,780
productivity suite that also provides

65
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,090
signal and the total signal that we get

66
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,569
per day is about six point five trillion

67
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:39,840
security signals coming through our data

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,840
centers now that doesn't mean that there

69
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,329
are six point five trillion attacks it

70
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:47,639
there can be multiple security signals

71
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:50,519
inside of an email for example it could

72
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,829
be the attachment of the email could be

73
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:56,790
malicious if the email is from someone

74
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,400
that purports to be from a company that

75
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,989
they're not actually from so there can

76
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:02,250
be a number of different signals even

77
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,650
one email but the total is about six

78
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,209
point five trillion I've heard we're

79
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:07,859
working on a new number but as you can

80
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:09,239
imagine at a company like Microsoft

81
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,849
we're always extremely careful about

82
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:14,010
what we report out so right now this is

83
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,989
the reported number but I think it's

84
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,349
going up next time we present that the

85
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:21,060
other thing that was we have our data

86
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,409
centers around the globe they're manned

87
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:28,680
24/7 by hundreds of security experts and

88
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,720
that means that they're actually Manta

89
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,030
you know in three shifts so we don't do

90
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,500
a follow the Sun we actually have them

91
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,709
watching the activity around the world

92
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:40,349
24/7 and then we bring a huge amount of

93
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:42,449
this information those six point five

94
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:44,849
trillion signals they land and something

95
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,590
called the Microsoft intelligence

96
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,449
security graph if you've been out to our

97
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:50,759
booth out front you've probably seen a

98
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:53,400
picture of this but the interesting

99
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,870
thing about it is that in addition to

100
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,669
their six point five trillion signals we

101
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,780
are looking at things like 450 billion

102
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,340
authentications every single month and

103
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,579
by seeing that kind of data we start to

104
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,409
see the way that the attackers are

105
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:09,540
moving and shifting so it was by looking

106
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,220
at the data in the graph that we

107
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,689
realized that they had moved from brute

108
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:15,060
force kind of attacks or if you want to

109
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,738
get into somebody's somebody's account

110
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,079
the traditional the older way is a brute

111
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,209
force attack you get a dictionary attack

112
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,729
you just kind of throw every single

113
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,400
possible combination of password at that

114
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,330
account right that

115
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,669
something fairly common to combat that a

116
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,379
lot of organizations what they did was

117
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:33,659
they started to do a time out you know

118
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:35,610
if you get three or five authentications

119
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,650
wrong you enter the wrong password we're

120
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,750
going to lock your account which kind of

121
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,639
creates a denial of service opportunity

122
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,159
but you know it's always a trade-off in

123
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,590
security right so by looking at these

124
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,240
authentications we actually started to

125
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,919
see a different kind of attack it was a

126
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,979
password spray attack and you guys know

127
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,949
what password spray attacks are password

128
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:58,949
sprays are when you take an own set of

129
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:01,979
email addresses very often companies use

130
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:06,240
a standard email address so at Microsoft

131
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,770
its first name dot last name at

132
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,500
Microsoft com boom everybody has my

133
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,139
email address right but you don't have

134
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,740
my password now so attackers what they

135
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,750
were doing when a password spray is that

136
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,789
they go to they look at all the the

137
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:22,860
different potential emails that they

138
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,210
think are going to be at a company and

139
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,370
they use passwords that are fairly

140
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,460
common or fairly well known go one two

141
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,889
three four five is is one that's we

142
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:33,360
can't have that at Microsoft because we

143
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,139
have strong password protect you know

144
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:40,440
requirements but Seahawks and variation

145
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,870
of Seahawks is something that we started

146
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,180
seeing thrown against Microsoft accounts

147
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,270
and why why would that be anybody know

148
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,219
what what Seahawks means to Seattle

149
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:53,250
people that's right that's one of the

150
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,039
sports ball teams in Seattle that's very

151
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,199
well-loved so that passwords bracer by

152
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,310
looking at why do we look at

153
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,319
authentications to see things like that

154
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,599
and we also you might notice take in

155
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:06,240
information from xbox into the security

156
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,430
graph you'd be thinking well what the

157
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,500
government's with the enterprises care

158
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,940
about what's going on in a gaming

159
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,879
platform gaming platforms are actually

160
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,819
very highly attacked areas and in some

161
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:19,259
gaming platforms

162
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,360
not on Xbox necessarily but some gaming

163
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,389
platforms have been used for money

164
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:27,300
laundering for example so you can get a

165
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,919
lot of interesting signal and actually

166
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,710
some of the original attacks that were

167
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,069
going on in in IT the very going way way

168
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:37,550
back they were where's base right

169
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,719
attackers was the first thing a lot of

170
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:41,220
attackers wanted to do you know

171
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,260
to crack the key to the game that they

172
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,670
wanted to play so that they could

173
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,530
distribute copies of these games freely

174
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,150
so gaming you can get a lot of

175
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,430
information so a lot more goes into this

176
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,050
but this is just gives you a bit of a

177
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,790
the size and the scope of what that

178
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,400
security graph has in there and by

179
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,530
looking through that information by

180
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,780
looking through and talking to the TR

181
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,700
teams or microsoft mystic the threat

182
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,250
intelligence center team by talking to

183
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,770
our response teams our detection and

184
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,600
response groups that go out when

185
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,310
someone's been attacked and help them to

186
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,350
recover these are all the kinds of

187
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,820
different pieces of information that we

188
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,760
bring together into this report so the

189
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,890
big the big news out of this one is that

190
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,780
we saw a 60 percent decline in

191
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:27,090
ransomware that's pretty good I mean

192
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,860
that's that's actually meaningful now

193
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,450
will it could it go up and down we're

194
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,890
actually seeing ransom more sort of

195
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,590
bubbling its head up again we had a 60

196
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,500
percent decline it's pretty rare that we

197
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,330
see positive news like this you know

198
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,260
it's like oh there's more

199
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,970
vulnerabilities there are more attacks

200
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,490
they've got more more you know devices

201
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,590
that they're using to throw a denial of

202
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,169
service right but we this decrease is

203
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,960
actually pretty good news and why why

204
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,240
did we why do we think no we can't say

205
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,669
definitively why there is a decrease

206
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:58,710
right the attackers don't say to us we

207
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,570
stopped sending out ransomware because

208
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,290
but keep in mind that ransomware

209
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,850
cybercrime is a business it's what's

210
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,800
projected to be a one trillion dollar

211
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,140
business right now so why would they why

212
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,240
would a cyber criminal probably stop

213
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,410
doing something because it's not working

214
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,120
right

215
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,560
why wasn't ransomware working because of

216
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,130
you because of you because we got better

217
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,500
a lot of organizations got a lot better

218
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,490
about patching about segmentation about

219
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,070
backups all of the things that can make

220
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,799
you if not fully immune to ransomware

221
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,200
far more resilient and far less likely

222
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,080
to have to pay that ransom so that's

223
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,360
good and I think this is again I know

224
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,250
like you know phishing ransomware I'm

225
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,870
not coming up here and telling you like

226
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,980
the most it's something you've never

227
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,250
heard but these numbers show that when

228
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,390
we do the basic

229
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,520
hygiene yeah it's not the sexiest thing

230
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,520
but boy does it can really create a big

231
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,420
difference for us so let's keep let's

232
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,980
keep doing it let's keep doing our

233
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,950
really good basic hygiene some very

234
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,890
America's specific ransomware and so

235
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,200
I've presented this in in Latin America

236
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,990
and there was like Canada Canada and the

237
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,330
US because Canada in the u.s. have the

238
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,430
the lowest encounter rates on ransomware

239
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,430
again most likely because most likely

240
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,230
again we don't know the attackers don't

241
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,140
tell us exactly why but most likely it's

242
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,900
because we're using legal licensed

243
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,730
versions of the operating systems we're

244
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,530
keeping them patched we're doing good

245
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,680
backups and were segmenting our networks

246
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,570
as needed so now while ransomware was

247
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,250
going down the attackers got to make

248
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,260
money somehow so they found that they

249
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,820
were easy it was they were making money

250
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,950
at cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency

251
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,500
mining is is kind of a you know it's

252
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,510
almost like the 180 of ransom work

253
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,250
because ransomware it couldn't be louder

254
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,590
it gets on your system and it locks

255
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,300
everything up and you can't do anything

256
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:00,930
at all

257
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,330
so you're just stuck and you have to pay

258
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,950
the bit corner you have to reimage that

259
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,920
machine cryptocurrency mining is the

260
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,860
opposite it's really quiet what they

261
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,690
want to do is they want to use your

262
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,410
resources to do the computational work

263
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,540
of the to do the mining for the

264
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,320
cryptocurrency

265
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,240
so they want to be actually fairly quiet

266
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,280
you might notice your fan go on if it's

267
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,610
on your own device if there's there's an

268
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,530
attack and they're doing a lot of mining

269
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,470
on your server forum for example if it's

270
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,960
on Prem server farm if it's or in the

271
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,000
cloud but if it's on Prem and there you

272
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,680
see a lot of mining going on and you're

273
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,090
one of your server farms what would be

274
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:44,430
one of the tip-offs for that heat yeah I

275
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,140
mean it would actually get very you

276
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,730
start seeing hotspots that happen from

277
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,100
the cloud to if you see if the company's

278
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,840
been attacked and someone's trying to do

279
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,580
coin mining in their tendency you might

280
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,850
actually see a hotspot show up but so

281
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,700
that the coin mining has gone up and one

282
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,530
sort of really interesting note is if

283
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,090
you ever want to see if there's a

284
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,730
correlation between profit and

285
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,740
and seeing things like ransomware and

286
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,600
seeing things like coin mining if you'll

287
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,450
notice when the cryptocurrency is at its

288
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,670
highest value that's also when we were

289
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,410
seeing the highest and counter rate of

290
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:22,780
the crypto of the coin miners what they

291
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,910
look like and how they get on to the

292
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,470
systems very awesome that they're

293
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,300
browser-based that one of the previous

294
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,800
speakers in this room was talking about

295
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,350
CMS content management systems and how

296
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,800
these can be ways to infiltrate an

297
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,120
endpoint device for example can also be

298
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,230
a way to get coin mining as well so but

299
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,180
but not the CMS often itself could be a

300
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,730
plug-in for example or you know

301
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,100
compromise injected hidden in multiple

302
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,500
flavor layers of the iframe and in this

303
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,170
one here's an example where you get a

304
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,600
warning and this is in French although I

305
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,970
don't know if it was targeted at Canada

306
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,210
or if it was targeted at France but here

307
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,920
it is oh no I think it's France actually

308
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,070
so here it is it comes up you get to a

309
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,420
website and it says there's a problem

310
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,340
and you can't get out of it what's it

311
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,380
doing in the background it was coin

312
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,840
mining another example of where you see

313
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,520
coin mining is people go to grey sites

314
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,320
say they want to see like the latest

315
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,590
Avengers movie and you shouldn't see it

316
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,960
if it's not if you don't go to a

317
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,400
legitimate site you pay to rent it and

318
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,260
all that but with it they get somebody

319
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,940
to come to their their gray site and

320
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,070
they've got a movie you it's actually

321
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:33,850
the movie

322
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,770
it's a pirated version of the movie but

323
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,240
it's the movie and while you're watching

324
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,920
it they were doing the cryptocurrency

325
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,920
mining in the backend sometimes I'll get

326
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,470
asked well hey I wanted to see the

327
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,030
Avengers movie and I got to see it for

328
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,740
free is that really a bad thing that

329
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,170
they're on my system yeah it is

330
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,880
you told you do not want to have

331
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,380
attackers the attackers that the fact

332
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,550
that they could get the coin mining

333
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,530
malware on your system means that they

334
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,510
infiltrated your system so even if it's

335
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,820
if it's not bothering you quote-unquote

336
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,680
it still means that the attackers on the

337
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,020
system so you don't want to you don't

338
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,400
want that

339
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,850
where are the the findings overall we're

340
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,800
actually pretty low here in the Americas

341
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,140
region we're lower than global for coin

342
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,180
mining encounters and again the lowest

343
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,670
encounter rates are in United States and

344
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,939
Canada so

345
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:27,579
so we're doing good okay fishing it's

346
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:31,559
not new I know that but we looked at

347
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:34,300
300,000 different campaigns for fishing

348
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,360
in 2018 there are 8 million business

349
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,920
email compromised attempts and we're

350
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,929
really rapid at getting out you know so

351
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:45,369
it's like we're actually really good

352
00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:47,290
we've all been kind of trained right as

353
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,329
we're kind of like lab mice we get an

354
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,860
email we got to respond we get an email

355
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,569
we've got to respond which is how we do

356
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:54,699
our work nowadays we're very very active

357
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:57,639
and responding quickly but we've also

358
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,439
are very active and responding quickly

359
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,050
to fishing too so it was about 20% of

360
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,759
users were clicking on the malicious

361
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,829
link in the first five minutes not

362
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:07,209
because they were like oh goody I'm

363
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:09,459
gonna go and get the malware because

364
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:11,410
we're just really good at being very

365
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,059
fast and very effective at the way that

366
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:17,410
we work in early respond now fishing the

367
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,300
message is increased they're still going

368
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,759
up so what you know what with ransomware

369
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,649
right ransomware was going down probably

370
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,839
because it wasn't as effective so if

371
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,149
we're seeing phishing continue to go up

372
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:30,100
and we're seeing increases in campaigns

373
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,370
what is probably on the other side of

374
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,120
that with the cyber criminals it's

375
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,730
successful right it's probably it's

376
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,949
working this is still the number one way

377
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:44,259
that folks are getting in so again I

378
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,420
know this isn't the most exciting topic

379
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,569
but we don't get with it we haven't

380
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:51,790
gotten it right yet and it's going to be

381
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,939
people process and technology if there's

382
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:56,410
gonna have to be we have to keep

383
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,720
training our users and you know I hate

384
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,860
when I hear like that

385
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,199
the carbon-based life-forms are like the

386
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:04,540
whole reason we have a problem you know

387
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,579
it's like oh it's the the idiot on the

388
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:08,649
other side of the keyboard I mean let's

389
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,589
not forget that we the human beings

390
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:14,290
created all of this so we can yell about

391
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,699
the cart you know say oh the car but

392
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:17,170
we're the carbon-based life-forms that

393
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,449
created computers the Cree that wrote

394
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:23,110
the code created the networks created

395
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,389
the systems so we created them so let's

396
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:27,939
not throw away every you know ok there

397
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:30,100
may be some people that are just kind of

398
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,049
hopeless but a lot of us I believe

399
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:33,790
actually all of us if we get the

400
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,410
training

401
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,110
and we know what's a problem and what's

402
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,029
a fish and what to be suspicious of we

403
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:41,879
can be the first responders we can be

404
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:44,069
the ones that alert that click on

405
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:45,569
especially if you've got an a mail

406
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,029
system that's got the ability to report

407
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:50,160
immediately if you if you suspect

408
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,439
something we can actually engage our

409
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:54,839
users to be better at being our first

410
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:56,879
line of defense against phishing that's

411
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:59,550
going to help us the other thing is

412
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,329
technology and Microsoft went and we

413
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,550
looked at how good we were at catching

414
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:09,209
fish about a year two years ago and we

415
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:11,490
were not as good as we wanted to be we

416
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,290
were missing not just against our

417
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,790
competitors but missing more than we

418
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,290
felt was was right you know for our

419
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,899
customers right we need to we need to be

420
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,850
the best we possibly can at desk

421
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,639
so we reassessed what we were doing and

422
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,470
what we were looking for and in terms of

423
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,779
if something is a bad piece of mail and

424
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,600
we came across four different dimensions

425
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,670
where we were able to increase our

426
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,240
accuracy significantly and the the

427
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,769
reason that we're showing this right

428
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:39,660
because this means very any competitor

429
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,130
can look at and go oh well that might be

430
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,019
a good feature that could help us true

431
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:46,230
but it's a it's really important that

432
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,720
all of us understand this is not about

433
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,149
the competition with one vendor versus

434
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:53,490
another this is about trying to get the

435
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:58,079
most the safest mail systems out there

436
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,600
and we're all interconnected in our mail

437
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,339
right so the better that we all cuz

438
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:03,870
we're all on one side we're on the good

439
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,579
guy side doesn't matter if you work for

440
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,020
this company that company you're in this

441
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,589
country or that were the cyber defenders

442
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:13,020
so sharing information can help us all

443
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,059
be smarter so that's why these are the

444
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,159
four things that we found really helped

445
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:20,010
a lot multi-factor authentication I know

446
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,409
in the last talk it was mentioned that

447
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,270
you know multi-factor authentication can

448
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,140
be can be gotten around it in some cases

449
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,429
it can but multi-factor authentication

450
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:34,530
we've seen in some instances in some

451
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,130
context and in on our space we've seen

452
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,580
99% reduction in attack so multi-factor

453
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,130
authentication very very very helpful if

454
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,600
somebody's got your your credentials

455
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,919
they're trying to password spray right

456
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:47,880
if they

457
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,130
mfa on they're not going to be able to

458
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,880
get in d mark D Kim SPF doing things

459
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,420
like querying is this the real is this a

460
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,310
real domain is this a domain that's been

461
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,320
around for a while if this is a real

462
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,260
trusted domain did that MX did the mail

463
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,720
exchanger that sent that email is that

464
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,250
the one that's supposed to be sending

465
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,620
the email so going through and doing

466
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,120
these additional checks to make sure

467
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,430
that you've got validity and doing

468
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,830
detonation a couple of times so checking

469
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,470
a link as an email comes in that's great

470
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,780
that's good so you check the length you

471
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,730
identify as a going Institute a

472
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,740
malicious site no it's not going to a

473
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,520
malicious site it looks all good right

474
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,040
but what happens after that check what

475
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,950
do a lot of attackers do they wait a few

476
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,500
minutes and after a few minutes they

477
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,040
turn that site they turn it into a

478
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,960
malicious site a site with drive-by

479
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,610
downloads it's going to be some other

480
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,290
that may be a malicious site even if

481
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,460
it's just going to harvest your

482
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,070
credentials so it's also important to

483
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,620
check not just the link as that email

484
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,620
comes in but also to check on click

485
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,930
because whether it's five minutes later

486
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,480
or fifteen minutes later it's important

487
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,490
to do that second check and that these

488
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,440
kinds of activities so whatever you're

489
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,970
using for mail hygiene if it's not

490
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,280
catching as much as you want those are

491
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,230
some ways you know these are some of the

492
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,030
features and functions that you can look

493
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,190
at I'm talking to your vendor about and

494
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,990
saying hey are you doing this are you

495
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,280
doing that because I think we can get

496
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,450
better about catching fish and then

497
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,000
supply chain attacks so I know we had a

498
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,950
keynote on this but we are definitely

499
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,740
seeing this now in a hardware world

500
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,470
obviously supply chains get very very

501
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,350
complicated but also in the software

502
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,360
world we have a supply chain that

503
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,910
discussion about CMS and content

504
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,650
management systems a lot of the places

505
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,530
where you seeing attacks or

506
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,430
vulnerabilities being introduced is

507
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,010
through plugins not because people are

508
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,140
terrible some plugins are written on

509
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,000
purpose maliciously a lot of plugins are

510
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,500
just they're great they add a lot of

511
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,180
functionality but they haven't been

512
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,250
written by security experts they haven't

513
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,620
been tested by security teams so always

514
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,630
be cautious of what you're using in your

515
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,800
environment

516
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,750
this definitely goes for things like

517
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:08,040
dll's for libraries the other places we

518
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,400
saw the the malicious activity or

519
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,760
malicious content was in containers so

520
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,250
be always be very careful of where

521
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,020
you're getting those pieces that you're

522
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,670
using within your development lifecycle

523
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,860
whether you're pulling down a container

524
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,290
from a community site or using a library

525
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,020
or using a DNR or using a plugin make

526
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,940
sure it's coming from a trusted space

527
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,120
and if you can do your own scanning on

528
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,700
it before you deploy it widely it kind

529
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,370
of seems like a little bit obvious but

530
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,410
based on the amount of math or that we

531
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,760
were seeing coming in through this

532
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,940
vector it's something that well it may

533
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,730
we may already kind of know it not every

534
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,600
company's doing it so that that's the

535
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,520
the summary of what we saw in the the

536
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,480
version 24 what's going to be coming up

537
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,370
we're not quite sure what what we're

538
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,540
going to be highlighting in the

539
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,700
twenty-fifth version that's going to be

540
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,679
coming out next year however I can tell

541
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:06,330
you a little bit of what we've been

542
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,130
seeing that's interesting so remember

543
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,420
again we want to look at all the data

544
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,910
for a year and then give you the very

545
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,970
best top-level analysis but you know

546
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,350
just to show you a little bit of what

547
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,580
we've been seeing we've been seeing an

548
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,740
uptick in these living off the land kind

549
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,370
of attacks so these are filelist malware

550
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,470
and file lists has become very popular

551
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,900
with attackers because it's pretty hard

552
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,260
to identify rather than putting an exe

553
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,500
portable executable that can be scanned

554
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,750
and say oh no this is bad I know it's

555
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,309
not here if you're using really heavy

556
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:40,200
you guys use heavy whitelist blacklist

557
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,030
you've got a really heavy whitelist

558
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:45,090
blacklist approach at your company you

559
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,190
know done and Exe would it would that

560
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,080
that's not on the whitelist right it's

561
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,270
not going to run so follow us malware

562
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,460
what they do is they run unknown and

563
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,670
approved executable so a really classic

564
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,400
example would be a malicious macro

565
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,880
running inside of word word is known

566
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,100
word is trusted it's probably on an on a

567
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,620
wait list but by running the macro

568
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,450
inside of it and making that be

569
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,610
malicious that's how the attackers they

570
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,010
evade detection so in the case of

571
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,670
Astaroth they were using women

572
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,060
to run a script and that was where the

573
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,760
attack came in so women as approved and

574
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,730
was trusted but by using a malicious

575
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,430
script through a trusted exe so these

576
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,070
are these are tougher for org than words

577
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,290
to prevent against I mean you can't just

578
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,730
look for a hash the way that we were

579
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,980
yeah we've done in the past but that

580
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,060
doesn't mean that they're impossible

581
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,670
there are absolutely ways to detect this

582
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,530
kind of malicious activity in large part

583
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,720
by looking back moving from just looking

584
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,670
at hash and looking at behavior because

585
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:52,160
it may be a trusted executable but the

586
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,500
behavior that malicious script is not

587
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,140
acceptable so by focusing on behavior

588
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,210
using machine learning models that are

589
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,280
very behavior based we're gonna get

590
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,200
better at finding these kinds of attacks

591
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,730
and that's actually how we found after

592
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:08,600
all some other things ransomware yeah

593
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,820
unfortunately it kind of crept back and

594
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,880
we're seeing it again but less so with

595
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,280
the the full you know pay me the sweet

596
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,860
sweet Bitcoin and more being used into

597
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,150
couple different ways one is this

598
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,210
destruction we're so trying to wipe out

599
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,280
their their their path you know so

600
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,890
there's been an attack wiping out what

601
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,750
they've done by just getting on the

602
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,910
system and and destroying all of the

603
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,250
evidence essentially also distraction

604
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,640
where so say you've got a company in

605
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,230
there they're known they're publicly

606
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,700
they've announced we're gonna put out

607
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,000
our earnings on X day Thursday at 4

608
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,380
o'clock right if you are an attacker and

609
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,500
you drop ransomware on that on their

610
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,780
systems Monday and Tuesday especially if

611
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,010
you get them close to the financial

612
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,720
services systems you may not be

613
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,550
interested in getting Bitcoin to pay you

614
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,110
for the ransomware which may be most

615
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,780
interested in is causing a distraction

616
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,300
so that that company that was about to

617
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,670
announce its earnings has now have to

618
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,410
question do we have to go look at our

619
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,390
systems is everything really okay is

620
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,850
this reporting actually accurate so

621
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,710
looking at these ways and distraction

622
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,840
and classic distraction it's like the

623
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,640
prestige if you can get the security

624
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,620
team focused over what appears to be a

625
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,900
threat its might be possible to do some

626
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:28,380
activity on the other side IOT IOT

627
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,049
and the convergence of IT and OT this is

628
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:33,179
becoming a place where I think we're

629
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:36,000
going to see more and more attacks going

630
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,980
on as we have the operational technology

631
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,450
side and the the informational

632
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,390
technology side coming together and then

633
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,340
attackers guess what we've been really

634
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,679
successful with ml and AI and security

635
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:49,320
and attackers are figuring that out so

636
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,730
they're doing their own their

637
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,350
adversarial perturbation they're trying

638
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,780
to change the date to change the

639
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,820
outcomes from the models and in some

640
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,250
cases figure out how the models are are

641
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,380
doing they're waiting so that they can

642
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:08,309
change the assessment so just a quick

643
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:10,890
note on ml and AI and how I think we're

644
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,750
going to get better overall as an

645
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,330
organization's going forward it's it's

646
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,919
really gonna be about machine learning

647
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:18,929
there's think about that six point five

648
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:21,659
trillion signals if you imagine even

649
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:23,520
with all the security experts that a

650
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,020
company like Microsoft you imagine

651
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,539
humans getting through that every day we

652
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:30,929
did a lot of humans and we know there's

653
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,880
a cyber security skills gap I mean

654
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,409
depending on which report you're hearing

655
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:36,179
it's like between you know hundreds of

656
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:38,730
thousands to hunt you tens of millions

657
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:42,059
but there's let's face it who here has

658
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:44,070
absolutely everybody you're all fully

659
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,710
staffed up perfect you got everybody you

660
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,390
want on your team and it's great you

661
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:51,450
know most of us or most of us have some

662
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,760
sort of a hiring issue in security right

663
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,650
it's hard to find enough of us to do the

664
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,500
jobs so we need the machines to help us

665
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,200
to get through all this data and we're

666
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,299
seeing some really promising solutions

667
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:06,179
coming from the from these so in and

668
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:08,640
who's here who's heard of petia not

669
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,620
Patea right

670
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,830
most of us ok wanna cry yeah

671
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:17,520
almost all of us have a bad rabbit so

672
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,950
far fewer hands went up bad rabbit was

673
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,780
actually the third piece of pernicious

674
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,799
ransomware that came out and in 2017 but

675
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,630
bad rabbit didn't hit the news because

676
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:31,020
as widely because that one actually was

677
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,580
stopped and it was stopped because of

678
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,140
machine learning it was encountered on a

679
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,280
system it was reviewed by the local the

680
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,890
lightweight machine learning on that

681
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,880
device

682
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,640
but that lightweight machine learning

683
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,590
was not able to define that it was

684
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,090
definitely needed it was it was

685
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,920
malicious it needed to be blocked so it

686
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,540
went up into the cloud and into the

687
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,030
cloud you can have much heavier

688
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,200
classifiers and machine learning models

689
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,550
and that's because you have a lot more

690
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,590
processing power I mean you've got your

691
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,900
laptop do you want or your critical

692
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,550
servers do you want to have machine

693
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,110
learning models that are taking up all

694
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:07,230
of your your processing power no you

695
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,810
want to do your work right so that's why

696
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,280
on the endpoints it's fairly lightweight

697
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,530
I mean you get into the cloud we have

698
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,580
these models that are running on

699
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,320
purpose-built systems so they can be

700
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,290
have much more power so when bad rabbit

701
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,280
got up there

702
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,250
and ultimately where it was detonated it

703
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,080
was defined as definitely malicious

704
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,450
needed to get blocked that took about 14

705
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:33,450
minutes a motet which is a curio Emmet

706
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,990
at which is another as a Trojan was

707
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,110
encountered in February 2018 in North

708
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:43,980
Carolina but the machine learning model

709
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,690
on the end point was able to determine

710
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,540
that it was bad immediately and it was

711
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,370
actually this this particular model was

712
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,830
looking at the portable executable

713
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,760
because there are different models some

714
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,140
some models are good at detecting

715
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,310
behavioral you know anomaly some models

716
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,580
were looking at PE kind of attacks so in

717
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,560
this one it was actually stopped in real

718
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,960
time and over the next 30 minutes we saw

719
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,910
over a thousand systems that were also

720
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:12,590
protected that was in milliseconds so

721
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,600
this is what we need right we need to be

722
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,970
able to stop the attackers as quickly as

723
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,220
possible and machine learning and AI are

724
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,260
really going to be powerful powerful

725
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,250
tools in this in this fight so some

726
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,930
quick recommendations the security

727
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:30,420
hygiene is really critical I know it's

728
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,730
not the most fun thing you know ml and

729
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,580
AI is really cool but security hygiene

730
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,470
but your configurations if you think

731
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,940
about the news every time you see a

732
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,040
problem that's will often when you see

733
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,660
problems with with customers that have

734
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,270
losses of with their cloud provider its

735
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,940
around things like configurations

736
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,560
security hygiene keeping the backups

737
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,540
making sure that you've set your access

738
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,300
control properly and training your folks

739
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,620
to be

740
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,570
part of the solution to be aware and act

741
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,180
and then to take a look at what you're

742
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,260
doing in security operation center

743
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:07,890
because sim technology is pretty old

744
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,050
classics and technology is about 20

745
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,350
years old so looking at at a sim that's

746
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,660
going to be a little bit more modern for

747
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,670
you because one of the big problems with

748
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,010
Sims right now is that it's really hard

749
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,530
to get the signal out of the noise who

750
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:26,160
here manages the sim rights rules for

751
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,420
the sim manages the sock just a couple

752
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:33,540
okay so those those rules tend to be

753
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,630
pretty hard to build well and they're

754
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,470
very static so when something changes on

755
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,420
the network when an attacker changes

756
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,210
their tactics or techniques is the sim

757
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,550
is that rule necessarily going to find

758
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:51,360
it not not not necessarily in fact a lot

759
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,890
of times one of my favorite quotes ever

760
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,290
was someone who was in charge over

761
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,240
eating sim rules said it's like a box of

762
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,760
knives yes like it's real easy to get

763
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,679
hurt and it's anakin and to not

764
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,240
necessarily accomplish what you want

765
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,809
with it

766
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:06,000
so as we look at the sock and we look at

767
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,770
all the signal that you're getting about

768
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:10,980
attackers and systems there's definitely

769
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,720
there's a problem with trying to find

770
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,420
the signal in all of the noise and it's

771
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,370
getting compounded by the fact that

772
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,490
we've changed the architecture

773
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,320
significantly the original architecture

774
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,390
in a security operation center was

775
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,640
around one company usually and we have

776
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,260
that perimeter we've also had the zero

777
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,270
trust conversation right with the CTO of

778
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,550
Canada talking about zero trust which is

779
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:35,040
great and it's again that perimeter not

780
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,809
perimeter if you look at sock sock is

781
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:39,000
having a similar challenge it's not

782
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,010
where where's your it where's your

783
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,870
information is it all in the data center

784
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,000
certainly not in one data center when I

785
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,530
first started using computers they were

786
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,450
they're actually hardwired right the

787
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:51,590
terminal was wired to the actual the the

788
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:55,530
mainframe so we're not in that kind of a

789
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,290
world anymore where we're walking around

790
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,050
with all of our with all of our data and

791
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,240
we've got it in multiple clouds -

792
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,830
there's a good chance you've got your

793
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,570
data in a few different clouds you're

794
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:09,059
using a SAS solution you

795
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:10,649
do you even know where that SAS provider

796
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:12,600
is using what cloud they're in so we've

797
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,549
got to figure out how do we bring how do

798
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:16,710
we understand all this data and bring it

799
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,929
together in a way without just doing

800
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:20,159
what we've done traditionally

801
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,659
and we think something that might be

802
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:23,639
really cool here and this is a this is

803
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:25,889
on the little bit on the theoretical

804
00:31:25,889 --> 00:31:29,070
side is to to respect the law of data

805
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,100
gravity and data gravity is a concept

806
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,100
that was introduced by Dave McCrory he

807
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,870
was working at VMware when he when he

808
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,090
came up with this but he posited look

809
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,309
the more data that you collect it's

810
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:42,299
gonna get it's gonna have a

811
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,009
gravitational pull and it's going to

812
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:46,950
pull services and apps to it and then

813
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,379
somebody and it's gonna be compounded by

814
00:31:49,379 --> 00:31:53,070
if you have an inability to support

815
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,110
latency so if it has to be really fast

816
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,110
right and latency which insecurity rate

817
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,999
latency is a big problem for us the

818
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:01,679
faster we find the bad guys the better

819
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,570
if they're sitting around for too long

820
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,429
then they've got the opportunity to take

821
00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:09,840
our data so latency and bandwidth if

822
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,610
bandwidth is squeezed for time you're

823
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,499
also gonna see more services and apps

824
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:15,330
coming to that that data graph of

825
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,039
gravity ball so we thought that's really

826
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,259
interesting what Dave came up with and

827
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:21,419
this is I think somebody challenged him

828
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,190
and said well could you do that in the

829
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,570
equation and so that's what that

830
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,190
equation is it's just what I just

831
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,590
explained that Steve's equation for data

832
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:32,429
gravity so but we some colleagues with

833
00:32:32,429 --> 00:32:34,619
Sean John and I at Microsoft started

834
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,869
thinking about well could this help us

835
00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:39,480
with the sim can we given the problem

836
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,340
that we've moved 20 years past the

837
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,549
original Sims and we've got our data in

838
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:46,379
so many different areas and they're

839
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:47,519
gonna be right there are different

840
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,919
clouds with different data balls Amazon

841
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,539
is going to have a lot there's a lot of

842
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:54,149
data in AWS there's a lot of data in GCP

843
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:57,720
there's a lot of data and Azure can we

844
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,940
start to instead of doing what we've

845
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,129
traditionally done in a sim and a sock

846
00:33:02,129 --> 00:33:04,499
environment which is point all of the

847
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:06,749
logs into one place and then you go

848
00:33:06,749 --> 00:33:08,070
through then you write all your rules

849
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,289
your hard rules and then then you start

850
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:12,330
to go through the the information could

851
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,769
we start getting a little bit better

852
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:15,769
about getting signal and alert and

853
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:18,330
information and doing some of the

854
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,509
analysis earlier in the process where

855
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:23,060
that data reside

856
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,060
and can we also get better about and

857
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,100
this part now so that that was the

858
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,840
theoretical part this is the this is a

859
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,180
now I'm going back to actual we also get

860
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:37,020
better and sim by breaking out of that

861
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,650
traditional rules based problem so

862
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,540
traditional rules based engine is kind

863
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,400
of a ghost down this attack path that's

864
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,440
fairly linear when you look at and we

865
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,940
saw the kill chain and I think it was

866
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,800
Rene's keynote she had that the standard

867
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,960
Lockheed Martin kill chain right we kind

868
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,700
of think about here's how the attacker

869
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,310
gets in they send the fish they download

870
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,560
the malware the malware does something

871
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,380
they then get access to a server they

872
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,540
exfiltrate the data and it's very often

873
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,820
they do go in that kind of a you know a

874
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,740
linear path but they also know that

875
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,380
we're watching them on those paths so

876
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,120
they're getting better and better about

877
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,880
not going on a straight linear path and

878
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,668
sort of very quietly moving around in

879
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:20,190
systems the traditional rules based

880
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,719
engines what they do is they kind of

881
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,370
look at that path and they look and they

882
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:26,610
also assess things based on what's high

883
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,918
risk if something is low risk if an

884
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:32,730
activity looks low risk oh that's okay

885
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,530
it's probably not going to lead to

886
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,440
anything or we've never seen that kind

887
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,630
of activity lead to something so let's

888
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,340
just put that away and we're gonna go

889
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,429
down the traditional path of it we we

890
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:46,770
normally see it this way so we're gonna

891
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,929
watch for the for the pathing and get

892
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:51,600
down to just a couple of prioritized

893
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,899
attack incidents but again attackers are

894
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:57,960
getting really smart and they're getting

895
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,270
very late touch and they're doing things

896
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:03,560
that have been not been seen before so

897
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,080
it's really time to go from a static

898
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,840
approach to rules in the sim and we're

899
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,430
going to get better at catching the bad

900
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:13,440
guys we start moving to a more machine

901
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,500
learning graph based approach and using

902
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,260
the ability for probability right being

903
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,820
able to say hey what's the probability

904
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:25,380
of even though this is a pretty low low

905
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,330
issue right now you know it's that

906
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,220
activity it doesn't flag is it's

907
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,990
definitely we've seen it lead to some

908
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:34,440
damage before it maybe as you go through

909
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,090
all the different probability models

910
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:36,570
using

911
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,210
Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations you

912
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,640
start to see oh you know what what we

913
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,920
thought wasn't necessarily going to be

914
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,440
an attack it could potentially lead to

915
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,000
an attack one that we might not have

916
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,100
even seen before so now you don't need

917
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,590
to write the rules for every single

918
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,840
attack you want to catch you leverage

919
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,240
the machine learning to help you

920
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,610
identify if there's a possible path

921
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:04,290
through and we've used this for our own

922
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,660
systems and we've gone from it with AI

923
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,240
driven detection we've gone down from

924
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,360
you know trillion billions of events

925
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,620
right the six point five trillion

926
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:17,670
signals gone down from the signals down

927
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,340
to reducing it to just a few suspicious

928
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,590
candidates and then using that

929
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,290
probability using a graph based approach

930
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:29,030
getting down to 90 true positive cases

931
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:32,130
so instead of just having to say I know

932
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,020
this one attack path I'm going to write

933
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,700
a rule it needs to get information from

934
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,170
this device in this device and that

935
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,610
means that there's a problem that sends

936
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,770
an alert you start using these graph

937
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,930
based probability and you say well what

938
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:46,350
if what if the attacker pivoted from

939
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,150
this activity to that activity could

940
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,640
that then create a loss of information

941
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,190
could that then be a problem with our

942
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,860
data so doing that moving that along

943
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,010
that path and then getting down to just

944
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:04,250
a few now the interesting thing is that

945
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,630
machine learning is not going to do it

946
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,800
all for us so it'd be kind of nice right

947
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,200
if I get up there like it'd be great if

948
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,940
I could say unsupervised machine

949
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,250
learning is here and it's basically

950
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,110
going to teach itself everything no you

951
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,910
still need to be very supervised with

952
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,200
your machine learning with the data that

953
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,860
goes in and also looking at the findings

954
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,960
and classifications that come out but we

955
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,760
also found something really interesting

956
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,320
was that when you combined rules with

957
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,190
machine learning that you got the very

958
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:41,550
best outcomes so by going just with the

959
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:45,030
rules we had 2.8% logins were suspicious

960
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,490
which doesn't sound like that much right

961
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,860
2.8% you're like I thought you're doing

962
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,160
pretty

963
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,769
right but if you've got a billion logins

964
00:37:52,769 --> 00:37:55,680
per day 2.8 percent is 280 million

965
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,109
suspicious logins that's a lot of people

966
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,509
time to go down that search so 2.8

967
00:38:00,509 --> 00:38:02,910
percent mm not good enough but when you

968
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,890
put the the machine learning together

969
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,619
with rules and wire rules still

970
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,470
important because rules can give us that

971
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,990
really good baseline and also rules are

972
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,720
based on what matters to you so the

973
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,130
machine learning model is looking at the

974
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,420
probability of there's going to be an

975
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,039
attack but you also know what's right

976
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:21,599
for your business nobody knows your

977
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,309
business nobody knows your your your

978
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:24,269
what you need to do for your

979
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:26,970
organization the way you do so combining

980
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,880
these rules with machine learning is

981
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,839
when we got down to less than 0.1% and

982
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,000
when I first had this I for some reason

983
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,339
I have the wrong number and I had point

984
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:39,750
oh one percent and one of her data

985
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,569
scientists was like no you know cuz

986
00:38:42,569 --> 00:38:44,940
they're so like and I was like wow so

987
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,819
he's like no it's totally wrong

988
00:38:47,819 --> 00:38:50,910
fix your slide so it's fixed but yeah so

989
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,950
it's a very I think I think point 1

990
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,440
percent is very impressive but it's not

991
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,390
it's not point oh one percent as I had

992
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,009
improperly had but anyway so getting

993
00:38:59,009 --> 00:39:00,690
down so you can see that's where you get

994
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:03,089
to a really good really good outcome is

995
00:39:03,089 --> 00:39:04,700
when you bring the two of those together

996
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:09,049
so we think going with machine learning

997
00:39:09,049 --> 00:39:13,380
rules and as date of gravity and as we

998
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,809
look at ways what can we do where our

999
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:19,140
gravity is sitting what can we do to

1000
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,079
maximize our own our visibility at

1001
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,210
machine learning really does help us to

1002
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,940
reduce the manual steps and the errors

1003
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,220
and then also help the humans because we

1004
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,730
need help

1005
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,380
we're overworked and we're starting to

1006
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,410
hear reports from the field about

1007
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:39,839
sock analysts getting PTSD and not being

1008
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,230
able to to you know to get to find what

1009
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,880
the problems are to respond to the

1010
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,079
alerts because they're starting to get

1011
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,730
too overstressed right they've we've got

1012
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,250
alert overload so trying to get this all

1013
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,559
make make it better for people and to

1014
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:55,079
make sure that we can speed the meantime

1015
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:58,319
to identify and meantime to contain as

1016
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:00,839
much as possible so MTT eyes meantime to

1017
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:03,029
identify and nm TTC is mean time to

1018
00:40:03,029 --> 00:40:03,750
contain

1019
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:06,720
and these the time to identify and

1020
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,910
contain actually has a real dollar value

1021
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,890
assigned to it as anybody ever heard of

1022
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,830
the poni Mountain Institute

1023
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:16,290
no okay a few okay so it's run by Larry

1024
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:19,440
Pokemon and what's awesome is there a

1025
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,599
dog-friendly company so if you're ever

1026
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,980
on the phone with them and you hear

1027
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,780
barking they're just like oh yeah the

1028
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,450
dogs are playing but their dog friendly

1029
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:30,030
company incredibly smart data analysts

1030
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,980
and they do once a year because it takes

1031
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,390
them the whole year to gather the data

1032
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,010
they come out with something called the

1033
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:38,540
cost of the cost of a data breach and

1034
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:42,420
this cost of the data breach report is

1035
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,730
put out usually I think IBM usually

1036
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,980
sponsors it but they put a dollar value

1037
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,760
on how quickly it takes to identify and

1038
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,650
contain the attackers and what that

1039
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,530
means per breach and it's usually in the

1040
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,810
millions of dollars range on average and

1041
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,970
the way that they do their data is they

1042
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:02,970
do averages so they throw away usually

1043
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,770
with the the what you're finding in the

1044
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,180
cost of the data breach from Pune Mont

1045
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,250
Institute aren't the big the big

1046
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,320
breaches that are in the news and the

1047
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,330
reason is that they would wait out the

1048
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:13,770
average too much what they're really

1049
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,420
trying to do is to get to a number that

1050
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,740
an average large size company can apply

1051
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,140
and you can see that by getting your

1052
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,640
mean time to identify mean time to

1053
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,859
contain mean time to remediate down you

1054
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,200
can literally save in a breach situation

1055
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:34,950
potentially millions of dollars so again

1056
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,290
the sir the security intelligence report

1057
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,119
it is free you can download it at

1058
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,869
Microsoft comm sir and we also have

1059
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:44,550
what's cool we used to do this thing

1060
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,619
where we would take all those account to

1061
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:48,900
rates around the globe and we would

1062
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,250
publish those all in the security

1063
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,260
intelligence report so you got it was

1064
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,170
like a phone book if anybody does that

1065
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,839
remember the phone book yes it was like

1066
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,930
a phone book which some of our customers

1067
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:03,420
absolutely loved and some did not

1068
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,820
because it was kind of a phone book so

1069
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,250
what we have now is we have the short

1070
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,810
version of the sir which gives you those

1071
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:11,550
those high-level insights that I was

1072
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,740
telling you about but all that data is

1073
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,109
still available to you so if you want to

1074
00:42:16,109 --> 00:42:17,010
say

1075
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,990
what does it look like for encounter

1076
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:21,000
rates in Canada you can go we have an

1077
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,800
interactive version of the sir up at

1078
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,960
that site and you can say just report

1079
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,910
out for me for Canada or just for the

1080
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,680
North American area

1081
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,270
just show me ransomware encounter it's

1082
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:32,070
just show me coin mining so we still

1083
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,079
have all that great data available it's

1084
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,880
just it's not published in the document

1085
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,859
as it was it's now available for you and

1086
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:40,260
an interactive site at that at that URL

1087
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,990
also whenever we find something if we

1088
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:45,089
see something we say something you know

1089
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:47,369
we we don't want to keep information

1090
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:50,160
about what an attackers doing private

1091
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,050
once we know that there's if it's if

1092
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,510
when it's time to share we share when we

1093
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,520
see malware when we see IO CS we put

1094
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,829
them out and one of the best ways to get

1095
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:00,750
that that up-to-date information and

1096
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,790
some really nice technical explanations

1097
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:05,099
of how and why we find things as our

1098
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:07,770
security blog thank you so much for your

1099
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,160
attention

1100
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,450
