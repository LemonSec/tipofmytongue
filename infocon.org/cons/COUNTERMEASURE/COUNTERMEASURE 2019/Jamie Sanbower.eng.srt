2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,540
so today I'm gonna hopefully help

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,280
everyone understand a little bit about

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,700
zero chest architecture and a little bit

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,910
of background on what today's session or

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,029
my goals are is really understanding the

7
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:24,029
marketing versus what theoretical zero

8
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,890
trust means and while that sounds boring

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,720
theoretical it's actually quite

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,000
interesting because what's old is now

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,760
new again and so we'll go through all

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,250
the strategies outlined by some of the

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,770
industry analysts and also try to cut

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,020
through the marketing buzzwords and

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,510
really talk about the core of what zero

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,670
trust architecture is really about just

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,800
for the record so no one leaves

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,050
immediately this is not a product pitch

19
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,789
we're gonna talk about zero trust from

20
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,280
an organizational standpoint and how we

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,489
actually want to achieve zero trust and

22
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,449
a little bit about me so as was

23
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,040
mentioned I'm a principal architect at

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,439
Cisco and I work mostly with customers I

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,390
do have the unofficial title of

26
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,760
integrations enforcer I'm a big believer

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,799
of architecture as an enabler for

28
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:18,930
organizations to get outcomes now one

29
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,659
point product or the super Silver Bullet

30
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,580
doesn't exist and how we actually put

31
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,640
things together matters quite a bit been

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,689
doing cybersecurity for 15 years a

33
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:33,720
couple fun facts one I am very cold at

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,369
least I got to see a little bit of snow

35
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,960
so that's helpful too I've done a couple

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,060
of books on access control in these

37
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,939
topics that are out there and three most

38
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,090
of the architecture I try to live and

39
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,939
breathe and test so my my actual home

40
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,920
power bill probably equates to about a

41
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,619
super targets power bill wife does not

42
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,430
like it but that's how we live so let's

43
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,590
talk a little bit about traditional

44
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,290
security architecture and really where

45
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,469
we've come from you know over the past

46
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,020
15 20 years and most of you should

47
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,760
hopefully be aware of this model which

48
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,740
is kind of the castle

49
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,840
and having a strong perimeter or trust

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,570
boundary and so for many many years we

51
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,210
look at organizations and how we protect

52
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,910
those organizations and it's the castle

53
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,890
with the moat so if I'm inside the

54
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,020
castle I'm trusted if I'm outside the

55
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,850
caste of all I'm untrusted and that

56
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,030
castle wall acts as the perimeter for my

57
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,580
organization or for my people that are

58
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,180
there and what this leads to is the bad

59
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,190
guys got pretty smart pretty quickly and

60
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,430
so they looked at the age-old issue and

61
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,880
they said well just like we saw many

62
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,120
many years ago I can insert or get into

63
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,950
the castle with pretty much ease

64
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,980
nowadays and so this changing landscapes

65
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,140
really changed the way that security

66
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,450
professionals have looked at how we

67
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,660
secure organizations and this perimeter

68
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,600
based approach really isn't working the

69
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,840
way that that people want it to and the

70
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,700
best example is I don't care which study

71
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,520
you look at but just fishing by itself

72
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,210
on average it's 12% click rate for

73
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,400
phishing emails it doesn't matter what

74
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,710
organization you do it work for it

75
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,680
doesn't matter if you train your your in

76
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,400
end users once a week once a month once

77
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,060
a year 12 percent of your organizational

78
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,000
users are gonna click on that bad link

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,460
and what does this lead to really when

80
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,920
we trust too much in an organization and

81
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,740
we look at protecting with that old

82
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,660
parameter based approach it makes it

83
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,220
very easy for the bad guy and the bad

84
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,830
guy can sit there and do his recon be

85
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,020
able to deliver some form of fish that's

86
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,690
very targeted a lot of my favorite

87
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:00,090
examples are HR emails job related

88
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,460
emails training related emails that will

89
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,750
get that person to click on that link

90
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,690
and essentially once I have one machine

91
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,580
within an organization most

92
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,300
organizations allow inherent trust

93
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,670
inside that parameter so just like the

94
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,970
castle I'm able to laterally move from

95
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,709
one machine to another machine very

96
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,250
quickly and as I I look at this as a bad

97
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,640
guy my goal is to do password harvesting

98
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,389
be

99
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:30,599
able to gather as much information about

100
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:32,550
the organization and pivot to the DC

101
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,830
where I can then take an exfiltration

102
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,930
of this how many of you have heard of

103
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,099
not Pat yeah okay about three quarters

104
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:47,310
good some of the larger customers out

105
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,080
there and it's very very public you go

106
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,879
read some of the articles to buy or did

107
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,249
a great article when we look at this

108
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:56,879
process the end result and this picture

109
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,430
was being able to take information out

110
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,479
in the ransomware example it was

111
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,000
encrypting all of those machines and

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,740
when we think about human interaction in

113
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,810
this in this topology and this in this

114
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,169
drawing the amount of machines that not

115
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:16,409
petya was able to take ownership of

116
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:19,469
install ransomware in a lot of the

117
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:21,539
examples are ten thousand machines in

118
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:24,300
less than ten minutes so I don't care

119
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,370
how fast your sock is I don't care how

120
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,979
fast you can write firewall rules no one

121
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:32,189
can stop something that quickly within

122
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:34,349
an organization and so that's that's

123
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:36,659
kind of what we're up against and so

124
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:40,529
zero Trust by default kind of started a

125
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:42,990
long time ago and hopefully you've

126
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,699
you've been watching it over the years

127
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,860
but in 2004 there was this thing called

128
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,479
the Jericho forum where a bunch of

129
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,879
Cisco's got together and they they

130
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,819
talked about how they can do security a

131
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:56,069
little bit differently and they focused

132
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:59,039
on this concept of castle and the

133
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,909
perimeter and not making that so the

134
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:06,089
number one facet of security and so in

135
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:09,810
2004 we saw that and 2010 the first

136
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,729
industry analyst came out with the word

137
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:14,550
zero trust and this was done by the

138
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,979
analyst at Forrester and so he came out

139
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,199
and said hey this is zero trust it was

140
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,169
all about deeper immunization being able

141
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:26,039
to really focus on moving the resources

142
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:27,599
and the protection from the parameter

143
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:29,849
inside the organization a little bit

144
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:33,899
deeper and then about 2014 we saw a lot

145
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:36,419
of additional things Google was actually

146
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:40,979
the first public example of a real the

147
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:41,430
earth

148
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,850
architecture in action now the funny

149
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,430
part about that story is in order for

150
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,370
Google to do it it was seven years you

151
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,310
know millions and millions of dollars of

152
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,990
investment and custom coding to actually

153
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,550
make zero trust real and we'll talk

154
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,750
about a little bit more with Forrester

155
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,090
in 2017 they kind of went from their

156
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,820
original three facets of zero trust and

157
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,800
expanded upon it and added three new

158
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,950
ones at the same time Gartner came out

159
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,780
with this model called Carta and we'll

160
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,690
talk about that and now kind of leads us

161
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,660
into today so today zero trust

162
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,280
architecture has been very generalized

163
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,180
and realistically the interest because

164
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,400
of breeches like not pat yeah because of

165
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,530
what organizations are facing the

166
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,460
interest is gone extremely big now I'll

167
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,740
ask a question to you if this thing's

168
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,750
been around for you know 14 15 years why

169
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:45,030
haven't organizations adopted it cost in

170
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,730
difficulty so when we start looking at

171
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,820
this thing it's not easy and so

172
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,070
marketing is not gonna solve the issue

173
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,350
for you actually being able to automate

174
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,170
and be able to take the journey of zero

175
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,360
trust and make it real for their

176
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,520
organization is kind of critical and

177
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,550
we'll talk about really what that means

178
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,280
and so if you don't take anything away

179
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,900
from all the different models and

180
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,670
industry and a list just remember this

181
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,160
basic tenant which is when we say zero

182
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,760
trust we're talking up about ubiquitous

183
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,830
least privileged access and so anyone

184
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,020
who knows firewalls or routers with

185
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,990
access control lists understands that in

186
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,640
general we have a implicit deny at the

187
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,360
end and a bunch of permits this is what

188
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,590
we mean by lease privilege if we have a

189
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,590
implicit permit inside the organization

190
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,440
that is not least privileged so again if

191
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,800
you look at 1998 security best practices

192
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,030
coming up from the u.s. NSA lease

193
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,110
privilege is in there

194
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,630
it's not a new concept zero trust is all

195
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,230
about

196
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,240
applying lease privilege in a meaningful

197
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,820
way and we'll get to what that really

198
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,040
means now if we compare and contrast

199
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,830
that fortress model that you know hard

200
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,870
outer shell of a parameter with the

201
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,270
chewy inside the traditional approach

202
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,580
was all based on creating security based

203
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,090
on location IP addresses and being able

204
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,760
to you know protect in in meaningful

205
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,460
ways but really not get to that least

206
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,130
privileged model with zero trust we're

207
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,120
focused on being able to apply trust in

208
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,730
context decisions at every access

209
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,800
request that takes place within the

210
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,830
organization and then the focus here is

211
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,170
to be able to extend that trust across

212
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,930
the campus the way in the data center

213
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,250
cloud every application that's in use so

214
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,140
if you just think about Internet by

215
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,480
itself it starts to get a little scary

216
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,040
it's like well how do I create lease

217
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,620
privilege for access from my users to

218
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,180
all the applications that they use on

219
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,750
the Internet

220
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,800
so we'll start to look at how we make

221
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,350
that real and and how we can automate

222
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,110
some of the the steps involved in this

223
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,790
process because that's the key here is

224
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,560
that if you try to do this thing

225
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,920
manually it's way too much money it

226
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,530
takes way too much time and and you're

227
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,360
kind of left with well I'm just gonna

228
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,310
add a permit at the end and life is good

229
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,380
so before we go any further I do want to

230
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,190
kind of look at the differences between

231
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,080
authentication and authorization because

232
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,910
this comes up quite a bit in Xero trust

233
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,490
hey if I authenticate a user it's the

234
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,470
same thing as authorizing their

235
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,570
permissions and being able to give them

236
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,930
access that's not really the case if we

237
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,180
look at my buddy Jaime here II also

238
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,960
another Jaime kind of look at

239
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,280
identifying himself to a bank so hey I'd

240
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,250
like $40,000 from Chuck Robin's account

241
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,840
do you have identification

242
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,620
well yes here it is so I'm able to

243
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,730
provide ID and identify myself now this

244
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,740
is authentication right I have a

245
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,500
credential and I'm able to identify

246
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,450
myself

247
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,040
the key thing when we get into zero

248
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,200
trust is being able to do that

249
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,380
authorization step and there is a big

250
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,150
difference in technology when you think

251
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,700
about authenticated and an authorization

252
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,940
so once we realize that yes you are

253
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,070
indeed who you say you are and you're

254
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,280
coming from a trusted point we also have

255
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,400
to authorize the connections the states

256
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,380
the packets everything that goes along

257
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,450
with it in this example the bank

258
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,270
hopefully realizes that this person is

259
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,580
not authorized to access money from that

260
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:47,570
account now as we as we move forward the

261
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,040
other big part of this is actually

262
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,110
logging so I need to be able to

263
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,060
understand when any authorization

264
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,560
authentication attempt takes place and

265
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,540
be able to monitor and track that over

266
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,180
time and you'll see that in most of the

267
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,680
models that we're going to explore is

268
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,050
within zero trust first part is about

269
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,180
getting policy in place the second part

270
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,560
is about being able to monitor over time

271
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,390
now please ask questions as we go it's a

272
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,570
it's a smaller group so we can interrupt

273
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,730
me as you see fit and we can talk

274
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,710
through some of this stuff now in

275
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,930
technical terms hopefully you all have

276
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:27,170
seen the concept of Triple A so we've

277
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,420
got authentication authorization when we

278
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,610
log these things we're gonna pretty

279
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,980
generally talk about accounting as that

280
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,660
method now once we look at that

281
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,550
traditional we can really start to see

282
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,670
where zero trust changes this paradigm

283
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,330
and it focuses on the data protection

284
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,630
not on attacks so you'll hear threat

285
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,090
centric versus trust centric quite a bit

286
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,490
in industry and as security

287
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,890
professionals we kind of look at threat

288
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,870
centric is the most important thing we

289
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,760
do we want to make sure we keep the bad

290
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,320
guys out we want to stop the threats

291
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,600
when we get into zero trust it's all

292
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,880
about the data protection and and really

293
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,030
focused on who should have access we're

294
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,110
also going to make some general

295
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:15,410
assumptions essentially we're gonna look

296
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,440
at a network and an environment and

297
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,180
assume that everything's already owned

298
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,329
and breached

299
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:25,670
if we assume that everything's hostile

300
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,040
we can also assume that the we're not

301
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,079
going to allow access until we know for

302
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,510
a fact that the user and the device is

303
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,180
actually proven trusted and one of the

304
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,190
concepts that people like to joke about

305
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,620
is let me just treat my organization

306
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,630
like everyone's on public Internet and

307
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,019
once I start to do that I can see that

308
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:47,779
I'm going to prove with lease privilege

309
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:50,839
the user of the device the status before

310
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:54,950
I ever allow access now one of the the

311
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,660
benefits here is once I assume that

312
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,420
things are untrusted you see immediately

313
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,220
the requirement to have things like

314
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,850
encryption so I must encrypt all that

315
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,350
data because someone's going to be e

316
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,140
stopping on it and finally I need to

317
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,440
verify before I trust and this is really

318
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,740
the the key takeaway right I can't just

319
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,630
because you're in my organization you

320
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,459
successfully connected to my wired

321
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,760
network you should be allowed to enter

322
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,730
the data center or access an IOT device

323
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,490
so really flipping that mantra if there

324
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,680
is no parameter everything's untrusted

325
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,690
until proven otherwise now there is a

326
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,260
lot of literal definitions within zero

327
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,870
trust and one of the fun parts about

328
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,510
this is literally when we look at

329
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,269
definitions like this I always think of

330
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:50,600
this example I go to the bakery I ask

331
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,940
for a cake and I say I'd like for a cake

332
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,070
to say thanks for a great year in purple

333
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,730
and as soon as I do that I get back a

334
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,620
cake that basically says thanks for a

335
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,100
great year in purple now

336
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,440
literal means a lot in technology as

337
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,180
well and so one of the things that you

338
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,630
have to to look at is when we look at

339
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,130
some of the models from Forrester

340
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,149
Gartner or Cisco other industry experts

341
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:22,100
how the literal definition applies to

342
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,560
your organization and so there's a lot

343
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,269
of organizations out there including

344
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:28,459
public and private sector that have

345
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:31,399
focused on different models and they've

346
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,649
come up with what makes sense for their

347
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:35,080
organization and what the

348
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,630
jurnee looks like but if we look at the

349
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,820
literal definition again it goes back to

350
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,800
things like the network is always

351
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,170
assumed to be hostile

352
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,470
I'm also internal is just as important

353
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,170
as external threats and they exist at

354
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:50,980
all times

355
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,640
every user device app Network flow is

356
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,850
authenticated and authorized now that's

357
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,320
a big one we're going to come back to

358
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,020
because technically when we start

359
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,850
looking at that literal definition

360
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,210
there's not almost anything in market

361
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,900
today that does that literal definition

362
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,300
so we'll keep keep looking at this

363
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,160
another one is automated and integrated

364
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,690
systems that are going to allow that

365
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,960
architecture to work in real time and in

366
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,300
the real world this is a big part and

367
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,790
then policies have to be dynamic now

368
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,400
this goes back to that threat use case

369
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,380
rate ten thousand machines ten thousand

370
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,830
or in ten minutes we have to have some

371
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,920
form of dynamic automation that happens

372
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,760
both while generating the actual policy

373
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,340
as well as if a threat or breach occurs

374
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,550
and so automation is what's gonna be the

375
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,920
big game changer here the reason why

376
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,230
this was so expensive to adopt was

377
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,360
someone actually had to go hey here's a

378
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,270
new application that we're deploying

379
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,760
here's how that application behaves in

380
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,160
the real world here that my users that

381
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,110
actually need access the application and

382
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,089
here's the additional context that I

383
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,099
need to be able to make an authorization

384
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:09,880
decision prior to opening things up or

385
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,550
allowing them and this this is difficult

386
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,730
like even from a vendor point of view

387
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,490
being able to get to all of these is

388
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,500
very difficult when we look at

389
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,050
architecture now all activity is logged

390
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,910
and accounted for while it sounds easy

391
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,160
it's actually more difficult than you

392
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,890
would think how many people have some

393
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,260
form of ACL that doesn't actually send

394
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,320
that record out or how about a dropped

395
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,090
packet because there's not a route in a

396
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,640
routing table all of that activity in a

397
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,740
zero trust world has to be logged and

398
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,200
has to be looked at on a consistent

399
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,310
basis and finally there's two kind of

400
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,230
key points here

401
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,630
Trust is earned number one and that's

402
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,150
gonna be earned through context who what

403
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,880
when where and how and finally it is

404
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,510
temporary and in when we look at

405
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,120
organizations and how we work temporary

406
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,210
is an interesting term as I come in in

407
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,850
the morning I connect my laptop to

408
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,850
wireless everything's good ten minutes

409
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,919
later I turn off antivirus because I'm

410
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:17,470
trying to download or play a game does

411
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,890
my trust change is it the same what

412
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,590
tools within an organization can

413
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:27,159
actually accommodate that difference in

414
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:29,559
state and the difference in context over

415
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:32,409
time and when we start to look at models

416
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:34,900
this is kind of the visual behind those

417
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,850
literal definitions I look at every user

418
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,760
they're owned device their owns data

419
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,730
networks I can't trust any of it I have

420
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,799
to do this thing in the middle which is

421
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,919
to really provide automated visibility

422
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,530
and trust verification and as a result

423
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,350
my policies go from this IP address

424
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,000
should be allowed to access this

425
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,650
application or this other network to

426
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,900
strictly context-based I need to know

427
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,799
that it's a compliant BYOD iPad with a

428
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:08,530
certain user on a certain group that's

429
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,640
trying to pass a non malicious file and

430
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,789
that entire session is encrypted and as

431
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:17,679
a result of all of those things I'm

432
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,409
going to allow that transaction to take

433
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:26,049
place now this is light-years beyond the

434
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:29,860
normal ACLs that we see this is getting

435
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,350
into being able to really understand

436
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,750
end-to-end how applications work and be

437
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,110
able to provide a consistent policy for

438
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:43,900
this type of context and criteria and as

439
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,409
I love to say what's old is new again

440
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:49,480
you know the analysts really have done a

441
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,880
good job in this market to help define

442
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,450
the vendors and define the industry

443
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,530
working with directly with customers to

444
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,200
understand and position zero trust in a

445
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,690
meaningful

446
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:07,090
way and I will joke that everyone

447
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,410
everyone looking at these models while

448
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,800
on paper they look very difficult you're

449
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,680
probably already doing zero trust in

450
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,660
certain areas of your organization no

451
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,800
matter who you are if you have a

452
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,250
firewall you're doing a portion of zero

453
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,340
trust if you're doing application based

454
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,220
authorization within your apps IT can

455
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,560
get to this portion of the app

456
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,580
accounting can get to this portion of

457
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,780
app that is a piece of zero trust now as

458
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,450
we deep dive into these different models

459
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,520
you can see over time how they've

460
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,010
changed so in 2010 Forrester came out

461
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,860
with their first model around zero trust

462
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,410
and the original had three tenets and

463
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,530
three pillars in 2017 they moved and

464
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,920
changed to three additional pillars and

465
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,230
those three additional pillars really

466
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,420
focused on making this a little bit more

467
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,760
real and attainable for organizations

468
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,670
just like the literal definitions were

469
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:07,790
kind of seemed unreasonable the models

470
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:10,400
have kind of incorporated the changes in

471
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,470
technology to make it actually

472
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,350
achievable for most organizations now if

473
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,780
we look at the original three tenets it

474
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,380
was all about killing the parameter

475
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,310
eliminate Network trust

476
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,660
I don't care where you're coming from

477
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,550
within might at work or outside my

478
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,120
network I need to eliminate a

479
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,220
location-based trust within my

480
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,360
organization finally I need to enforce

481
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,710
segmentation across the entire network

482
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,890
and the last piece to this was gain

483
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,320
network invisibility analytics now in

484
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,820
2010 this this sounds pretty day-to-day

485
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,950
operations for most organizations today

486
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:52,220
but in 2010 a lot of these things really

487
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,670
didn't exist for a lot of organizations

488
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:57,500
now as cisco obviously we care about

489
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,630
these things because how we deal with

490
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,150
devices coming down onto the network and

491
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:06,380
how we actually achieve these three very

492
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,980
important goals of zero trust we had to

493
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,290
adapt as well just like most of our

494
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,180
customers and organizations had to adapt

495
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,880
to these three primary

496
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,810
now if we step forward the focus kind of

497
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:23,020
changed now what happened between 2010

498
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,550
and 2017 some gray cloud thing came

499
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:31,120
about right so as cloud adoption as SAS

500
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,060
adoption happened very very quickly

501
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,270
across the industry Forrester looked at

502
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,040
this thing and said hey let's let's

503
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,900
focus on the problem a little bit

504
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,150
differently and so now they focus on

505
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,630
these three pillars so people and that

506
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,760
incorporates all types of different

507
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,310
users it could be individual

508
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,620
constituents if I'm a public sector

509
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,680
organization I have my customers our

510
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,300
citizens that need to access

511
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,200
applications it could also be workers we

512
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,800
also look at workloads now workload used

513
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,560
to be a physical box that's at in a data

514
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,620
center today a workload could exist

515
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,720
temporarily in a container that's up for

516
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,240
three microseconds does its job and goes

517
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,550
down doesn't mean I still don't need to

518
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:21,640
focus on that and then finally data so I

519
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,470
need to be able to focus on the data and

520
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,090
their permissions associated with the

521
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,670
data so everything you see coming out of

522
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,830
Forrester today is gonna be focused on

523
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,140
these three pillars how many of you read

524
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,560
Forrester reports look at Forrester okay

525
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,230
just a few so Forrester really because

526
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,510
they started this thing in 2010 I would

527
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,150
say has been working on it a little bit

528
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,890
longer than the rest of the industry

529
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,250
analysts we're now seeing things coming

530
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,190
out of for example NIST has a draft

531
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,920
document associated with what they

532
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,500
believe zero trust is a lot of the

533
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,030
public sector organizations are

534
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,830
providing feedback at this time if you

535
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,570
haven't read through it I encourage you

536
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,060
to look at that NIST draft document as

537
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,830
well it's kind of a good follow-up

538
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,250
homework assignment from today's session

539
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,840
the other one that everyone's heard of

540
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,960
Gartner okay so you know on the flip

541
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,450
side Gartner conduct came a little bit

542
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,670
later to the game but at the same time

543
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,550
they added a lot more than just the

544
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,430
basic tenants of Xero trust so the way

545
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,860
they looked at this problem was it is a

546
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,260
continuous thing that I need to

547
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,670
form and I also need to understand risk

548
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:36,570
associated with my organization

549
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:40,030
alongside trust so as they looked at the

550
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,070
model it actually goes deeper than some

551
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,350
of those literal definitions of zero

552
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,750
trust where I'm focused on

553
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,160
trustworthiness well they're bringing in

554
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,870
this risk equation which is super

555
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,110
important right you know if a device is

556
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,900
a high-risk device connecting to an

557
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,300
application I'm going to trust it

558
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,780
differently then if it's a patched fully

559
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,710
patched ready to go low risk system and

560
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,690
this also incorporates risk is goes

561
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,970
associated with the application with the

562
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:13,660
user with everything associated with

563
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,800
that model or architecture so there's

564
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,260
kind of five steps within this carta

565
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,870
model is you know security posture must

566
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,090
constantly change meaning I need to look

567
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,610
at this at a continuous basis I also

568
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,210
need to look at the risk and trust score

569
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:34,480
over time so one second I'm okay the

570
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,580
next second I go to site I download

571
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,860
malware my machine is not no longer

572
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,620
trustworthy I need to be able to

573
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,280
incorporate that now within carta one of

574
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,990
the challenges you'll see is there is a

575
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,600
very stringent or literal definition

576
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,820
where you should score and rate all

577
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,900
entities now while that is a good goal

578
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,380
and you do see programs out there like

579
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,080
in the the US government we have a small

580
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,130
program called CDM anyone heard of CDM

581
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,200
no so continuous diagnostics and

582
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,210
monitoring so the US government actually

583
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,440
tried to formalize risk scoring of all

584
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,260
assets while ago and one of the the

585
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,120
biggest thing was trying to move away

586
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,140
from a point in time evaluation where

587
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,000
we're doing our scans and doing

588
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,980
certification and accreditation once a

589
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,920
year - if things change in two weeks I

590
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,780
need to be able to update that scoring

591
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:35,490
so CDM kind of focuses just on that

592
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,930
score and rate all entities on a

593
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,910
consistent basis within that gardiner

594
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,669
model now finally we need to

595
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:44,470
shift away from one-time binary

596
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,389
decisions and this is kind of a key

597
00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:49,029
point as well is that the way we operate

598
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:53,529
in a lot of networks and even today is I

599
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:56,049
figure out who you are I figure out your

600
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:59,739
device I allow communication once that

601
00:26:59,739 --> 00:27:01,809
session is allowed we never check back

602
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:05,049
in until it's closed and so we have to

603
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:07,059
change that a little bit with zero trust

604
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,919
we have to have a way to insert

605
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,419
ourselves and be a part of the

606
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:12,999
conversation conversation being network

607
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:16,840
conversation at all times in some cases

608
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,200
this is easy to do in other cases it's

609
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,259
difficult to do if you look at protocols

610
00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:26,379
like sam'l and how we integrate with SAS

611
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:28,600
applications from an authentication and

612
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,600
authorization point of view there's just

613
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,549
a timer and that's all you're left with

614
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:36,159
so there is no consistent way to insert

615
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,980
some form of inspection at all times

616
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,009
it's well I've got a timer if I set it

617
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:44,980
to 60 minutes I'll check once an hour on

618
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,389
this session to make sure nothing's

619
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:48,700
changed if I set it to 10 minutes I'm a

620
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,179
little bit better but understand that

621
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:54,909
this is where we get into literal versus

622
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:58,149
the actual way that most organizations

623
00:27:58,149 --> 00:28:02,230
are deploying zero trust today jump back

624
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,269
to an organization that actually made

625
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:07,059
this thing work so with Google Beyond

626
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:09,489
Corp they essentially spent a lot of

627
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:11,710
time we are connecting the way they do

628
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,659
business and they are a different

629
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:16,450
business rate most of their users are

630
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,509
developers most of their organization

631
00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:24,220
has a very specific mission and and

632
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,859
operation versus some of the public

633
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:28,570
sector organizations that are probably

634
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,659
in this room their goals that they

635
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:34,749
accomplished were pretty on point though

636
00:28:34,749 --> 00:28:36,669
from a zero trust point of view if we go

637
00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:40,359
back to both Gartner's model foresters

638
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:43,659
model this follows very similarly what

639
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:45,159
we're trying to do with zero trust which

640
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:47,139
is I want to first start with securely

641
00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:49,269
identifying the device if I don't know

642
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,460
what the device is if I don't know the

643
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,249
status of that device I can I don't

644
00:28:54,249 --> 00:28:55,899
understand whether I should trust it or

645
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:56,220
not

646
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,570
also I need to securely identify the

647
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,180
user how do we do this typically with

648
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,620
some form of a multi-factor

649
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,200
authentication so a username password

650
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,390
and a zero trust world is not typically

651
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,700
not good enough I need to actually be

652
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,220
able to guarantee it's Jamie who is

653
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,380
connecting to this application the only

654
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,000
way I'm gonna do that is with more than

655
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,120
one factor of off removing trust from

656
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,300
the network is important so being able

657
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,450
to understand that this parameter is

658
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,930
gone and I need to allow application

659
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,700
access just like everyone's on the

660
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,310
internet is kind of a key part of the

661
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,560
way they did this and in order to

662
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,080
accomplish it number four is the way

663
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,000
they accomplished it which was to

664
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,520
externalize all of their apps so if I'm

665
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,770
sitting in an office at Google it's the

666
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:47,800
same as sitting at Starbucks and being

667
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,980
able to access the same applications

668
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,680
with or without a VPN and be able to

669
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,600
externalize those applications to do my

670
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,200
job and the final part is implement

671
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,420
inventory based access control so as

672
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,640
inventory changes over time this should

673
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,000
also be a part of this and a fun fact so

674
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,700
Cisco eighteen months ago or so acquired

675
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,950
a company called do well one of the

676
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,300
things that duo does they have a

677
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,800
specific setup and policy model called

678
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,200
duo beyond well it's modeled directly

679
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,750
off of Google's model and we were the

680
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,100
first commercial implementation of this

681
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,730
beyond Corp architecture now when we

682
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,680
look at the the Google architecture in

683
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,180
detail and hopefully some of you have

684
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,830
seen this before

685
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,840
essentially the way they accomplish

686
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,810
those five items like I mentioned seven

687
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:43,090
years a lot of money and a lot of

688
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,040
programming that went behind this to

689
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,170
make it real but they were able to take

690
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:51,130
and kind of focus on access proxy radius

691
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,500
single sign-on and then getting that

692
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,810
trust inference within a device

693
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,090
inventory system so being able to

694
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,730
understand who what when where and how

695
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,240
and then externalizing all those apps to

696
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,460
be able to use the context associated

697
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,410
with those access requests

698
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,260
now finally we kind of see all of these

699
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,510
models and you know this is kind of a

700
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,670
joke on my own company as well as all

701
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,380
the probably companies that sit out

702
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,510
there that are vendors you know as soon

703
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,390
as everyone started talking about zero

704
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:27,050
trust and see the benefits within some

705
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,430
of these breaches that we've we've

706
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,490
actually seen everyone on the planet now

707
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,280
has a zero trust product and and the

708
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,910
joke is now that you've seen 15 minutes

709
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,920
of these models there's not a single

710
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,800
product out there that will help you or

711
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,040
or check the box that you have zero

712
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,740
trust there is a lot of things working

713
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,290
together to be able to achieve zero

714
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:54,410
trust architecture so don't let Cisco or

715
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,300
any other company out there tell you

716
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,670
here's of magic shiny box you implement

717
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,260
this thing and you are zero trust

718
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:04,010
because it's not a thing and and that is

719
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,930
that is pretty funny because you will

720
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:09,080
see marketing coming from so many

721
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,970
vendors like I have this magical

722
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,890
authentication box it does zero trust

723
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,310
for you it does a part of zero trust and

724
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,880
and while we the the journey is as

725
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,220
important as the destination here it's

726
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,830
not gonna check the architectural box

727
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,290
and say you're done now if we look at a

728
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:30,830
true theoretical example of zero trust

729
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:33,410
it kind of can look like this and some

730
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,080
organizations do build their own model

731
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,660
so they have developers just like Google

732
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,570
did and they've started to build some of

733
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,720
these some of these boxes here which

734
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,500
from a policy engine point of view we

735
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,480
have a zero trust policy engine that's

736
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,820
pulling information from a trust engine

737
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,400
and then that trust engine is being

738
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,370
delivered or addressed by multiple

739
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,170
solutions this could be patch management

740
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:03,650
it could be device or user control all

741
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,410
of that information feeds that policy

742
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,420
engine that then starts to push out

743
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,730
policy to enforcement points throughout

744
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:15,010
a network now all of the same criteria

745
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:18,740
matters here so parameter parameter

746
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,680
lists deny all access unless explicitly

747
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,880
allowed we

748
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,340
to make sure we address users devices

749
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,620
application services all of them need to

750
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,300
be authenticated and we need to

751
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,990
continually evaluate risk now when we

752
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,450
look at that threat centric versus that

753
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,420
trust centric model you can start to see

754
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,610
today versus where we're trying to go

755
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:43,370
which is focusing on those main tenants

756
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,010
and then trying to make this switch

757
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:49,520
between a time bound policy to a per

758
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,220
transaction policy and then finally

759
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,620
getting to dynamic policy is the only

760
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,300
way that organizations are going to make

761
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,660
this real if you try to model every user

762
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:05,020
device application service manually

763
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,550
that's all you're gonna do I hope you

764
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,440
have a team of 50 people just trying to

765
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,230
model stuff because just getting that

766
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,540
context around all of the things with

767
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,510
NIT is a full-time job for many many

768
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:20,690
people now one of the things that makes

769
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,020
this really important is being able to

770
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,570
consolidate and work together so whether

771
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:29,149
it's you know Cisco doing trust engines

772
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:30,830
and being able to bring in context I

773
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,750
have to work with patch management I

774
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,300
have to work with the endpoint malware

775
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,280
software I have to be able to work with

776
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,590
existing tools and and put them together

777
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:42,190
in a meaningful way to be able to do

778
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,530
authorization based on trust and for the

779
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:48,290
old-school triple-a fans as I gave the

780
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,290
the difference with four before we have

781
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:55,030
to move from a almost radius style

782
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,920
ostentation and accounting to more of a

783
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,310
tax level style of command authorization

784
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:04,190
so everything that's done within the IT

785
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,800
organization is tracked and authorized

786
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,670
prior to being allowed you know

787
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,780
traditionally you can look at some

788
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,910
organizations that I've worked with some

789
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,280
that get very very close to this style

790
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,460
of actual access control but it equates

791
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,730
to millions of lines of code within

792
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,860
firewalls millions of lines of access

793
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,390
control lists within servers and

794
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,070
applications and it's very very

795
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:32,330
difficult to manage so at this point you

796
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,340
should hopefully be like why is this guy

797
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,109
telling me zero trust has really

798
00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:38,539
really really hard and and so what can

799
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:40,700
we do today as an industry as an

800
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,099
organization to actually start that

801
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,380
journey with zero trust there are a lot

802
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,180
of things it's really about creating

803
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,920
that journey and focusing the efforts

804
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,349
just getting to the point where you can

805
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,930
shift to smaller more frequent context

806
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:56,930
based decisions is important the other

807
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:59,029
thing that helps break it down and at

808
00:35:59,029 --> 00:36:03,289
Cisco we've done this in a meaningful

809
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:06,349
way is being able to look at different

810
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:09,460
use cases so starting somewhere easier

811
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,369
for example focusing on the workforce

812
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:15,200
workloads or workplace and kind of

813
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,089
breaking it down into manageable chunks

814
00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:21,710
as a part of the journey now what do we

815
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:25,190
mean by shorten you know or or do

816
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,650
smaller more frequent things like timers

817
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,249
sam'l token like dot 1x authentication

818
00:36:31,249 --> 00:36:33,739
timers how many of you run a destroy 1 X

819
00:36:33,739 --> 00:36:38,059
and authenticate users on a network 1 -

820
00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:40,819
ok so all of you hopefully do it on

821
00:36:40,819 --> 00:36:42,710
wireless if you're running Wireless if

822
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:45,109
you're not doing it on wired that would

823
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:47,450
be another big part of that step right

824
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,599
being able to authenticate prior just

825
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,849
allowing a device to come in now also

826
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:54,999
being able to incorporate additional

827
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:57,890
context as a part of firewalls as a part

828
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:00,920
of the switching data center or cloud

829
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,759
infrastructure all of that stuff matters

830
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:06,859
now as I mentioned at Cisco we've kind

831
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:09,140
of broken this apart into three main

832
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,569
categories focusing on the workforce the

833
00:37:11,569 --> 00:37:13,789
workloads in the workplace those things

834
00:37:13,789 --> 00:37:16,309
do tie together so a user accessing an

835
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:19,369
application and my public or private

836
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:21,170
cloud is kind of a cross between

837
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:25,089
workforce and workload the workplace is

838
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:28,130
actually focused on anything including

839
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,079
users that are connecting to a network

840
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,380
that you own now I said don't trust the

841
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,079
network workplace is all about creating

842
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,089
trust for their users and devices prior

843
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,150
to allowing that access when we when we

844
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,829
break this down you'll see it actually

845
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:46,730
in three logical steps and so I'm on the

846
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,349
zero trust working group within Cisco

847
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,550
and one of the

848
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,170
challenges we were looking at is well

849
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:54,620
how do you apply zero trust to these

850
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,080
different use cases workforce workload

851
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,660
workplace and what I found was

852
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,910
consistently we're trying to do three

853
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:04,520
steps every time and those three steps

854
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,290
are established trust and the way I'm

855
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,090
gonna establish trust is look at user

856
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,010
and device identity it's going to be

857
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:12,050
looking at device posture and

858
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,010
vulnerabilities

859
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:15,170
now when I say device posture it's

860
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,300
things like is the system up to date is

861
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,240
antivirus anti-malware up the day does

862
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,080
it have the appropriate IT resource you

863
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,510
know software on there and then finally

864
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,970
once we have the information associated

865
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,880
with that it has it been infected and

866
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,580
that's an interesting point right it is

867
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,070
we want to go beyond the does it run my

868
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,320
software do I trust it from a device and

869
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,440
user identity but also what is the level

870
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,330
of vulnerability so we can evaluate risk

871
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:48,140
and then to have we seen an indication

872
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,840
of compromised in the previous day or so

873
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,300
to make sure that this thing isn't owned

874
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,000
prior to allowing access now once we

875
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,310
establish trust it's all about enforcing

876
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,560
trust based access and that's all about

877
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,810
being of a leverage trust data to create

878
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:05,420
policy whether it's on a network within

879
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,540
your application within the cloud we

880
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,670
have to leverage that data to be able to

881
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:14,060
make a system decision and then finally

882
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,940
for all of those different use cases you

883
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,160
should be looking at how you

884
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,120
continuously verify trust

885
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,520
so once I've allowed access how do I

886
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,760
continually look at whether that user

887
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,910
device application is still trusted in

888
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,860
my environment and the best example of

889
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,810
that is you know I get on my network I'm

890
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,580
starting to access an application I

891
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,380
download malware and my machine gets

892
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:41,030
owned how do we actually allow or stop

893
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:44,240
that flow from going after we've already

894
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,040
allowed it access on the network so

895
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,770
continuously we need to check the trust

896
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:52,120
level the status of all these things now

897
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:56,030
with this there's steps so like in work

898
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,550
force we're focused on how we do things

899
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,500
like multi-factor authentication how we

900
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,550
apply policy and endpoint

901
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,220
and then per application visibility and

902
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,430
this is for applications you own like

903
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,640
you've moved application externally into

904
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,410
the cloud or you have it on premise and

905
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:16,080
it's also about applications that you

906
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,720
don't own so do I have a user going to a

907
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,330
box even though my organization doesn't

908
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:25,110
use box is a cloud storage company so

909
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,360
being able to control yours and other

910
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,090
applications is important and then what

911
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,700
one kind of scary note you know if you

912
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,620
haven't invested in MFA I don't care

913
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:38,280
what MFA compromised credentials is kind

914
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,310
of the big thing I mean the fact of the

915
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,620
matter is is a part of those phishing

916
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,780
attempts as a part of those breaches

917
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,780
almost all of them include some form of

918
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,530
password password compromise and that

919
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:55,080
password compromise ends up allowing for

920
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,870
full keys to the kingdom typically so

921
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:01,680
MFA is a good start for workforce with

922
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,230
workloads being able to actually

923
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,320
identify applications so give you a

924
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,480
couple examples here being able to

925
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,490
actually do automated discovery and

926
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:13,140
dependency mapping between one

927
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,240
application and another I had one

928
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,070
customer where they were doing this they

929
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,230
had a thousand applications and they

930
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,760
were they were accomplishing this

931
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,130
process to be able to create a zero

932
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,770
trust policy what should be allowed and

933
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:28,230
it took them about three months every

934
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,930
three to four applications once they got

935
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,360
to automation they were able to speed up

936
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,580
to about 200 applications in the same

937
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,310
timeframe so having some form of

938
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:40,290
automation to be able to identify and

939
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,840
customize those apps is is super

940
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,760
important and finally within the

941
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,360
workplace kind of the goal here and I'm

942
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,890
skipping a little bit you guys had will

943
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,870
have access to the slides later just

944
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,130
want to have time plenty of time for

945
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,500
questions

946
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,600
focusing on how we identify devices now

947
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,010
one of the things that I've seen quite a

948
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:06,000
bit is trying to understand IOT from a

949
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,830
business point of view and things have

950
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,630
changed quite a bit it used to be IT

951
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,850
bought everything that went on the

952
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:14,340
network everything that people use from

953
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,250
an information tech

954
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,920
Najee point of view nowadays we're

955
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,050
seeing more and more lines of business

956
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:23,440
or organizational leaders managers

957
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,950
directors going out and procuring

958
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,720
devices that they're just plugging in so

959
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,060
typically from an IT point of view we

960
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:34,060
can't say no but we have to be able to

961
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,520
identify the IOT device understand

962
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,260
whether or not we want to trust it or

963
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,830
not before we apply a least privileged

964
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:44,740
policy so that morale the story is we've

965
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,990
seen more and more devices come out of

966
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,820
the box with tons and tons of

967
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,220
vulnerabilities do we want those on our

968
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:54,180
network absolutely not but without the

969
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,800
automation to be able to say hey dr.

970
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,620
so-and-so plug this new medical reader

971
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:03,190
into my network and it has 15 CV e9o and

972
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,620
above vulnerabilities on it and here's

973
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,360
how I want to deal with it you can't

974
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,350
make that policy so visibility and

975
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:12,280
enforcement is kind of the key thing

976
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,150
here couple closing thoughts I know I

977
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:19,360
went really heavy on some of the models

978
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,190
the reason why we like to give you that

979
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,290
history lesson a little bit and so you

980
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:26,740
see where we've come from all the way

981
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,810
back to 2004 all the way up to today

982
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:30,730
zero trust architecture has changed

983
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:33,400
quite a bit the basic premise of lease

984
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,470
privilege has not changed how you

985
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:38,740
accomplish lease privilege has there are

986
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:41,380
a lot of solutions out there that can

987
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:44,320
help you on your journey you do need to

988
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,000
focus though if you try to boil the

989
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,740
ocean if you try to one day be

990
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,270
completely open with a brick with a

991
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:54,970
parameter soft chewy inside and then

992
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:57,010
tomorrow want to be zero trust it's

993
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,440
gonna either blow up in your face or

994
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,380
it's it's not gonna work unless you kind

995
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:06,760
of change the way you do operations one

996
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,500
other kind of note don't forget about

997
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,370
the IOT devices there's so many models

998
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:14,440
and organizations that are looking at

999
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,150
this problem and they're focused on the

1000
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,980
user problem which is this users

1001
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:20,560
accessing applications and how we do

1002
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,290
zero trust for that there's just as many

1003
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:26,920
non user devices today as there are user

1004
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,430
devices and that

1005
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:31,460
is changing so as you look at zero trust

1006
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,560
and how you do it think about all of the

1007
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,360
devices that don't have a user behind it

1008
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,610
and how you will deal with those devices

1009
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:42,050
and then finally like I mentioned shift

1010
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:44,000
to the smaller contextual based

1011
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,400
operations even if it's just changing

1012
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,340
your firewall from being IP based over

1013
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,380
to user based or focused on applications

1014
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:55,100
that's a step forward many organizations

1015
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,900
are starting top down with zero trust

1016
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,880
though they're looking at how they get

1017
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,340
to that end goal three to five years

1018
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,080
from now and what are the steps within

1019
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,440
that journey that they can take biggest

1020
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,000
example that I think is the most

1021
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,610
powerful is in the data center

1022
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:13,370
so most data centers and applications

1023
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:16,130
today have a control on what users can

1024
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,330
get in but there's very limited

1025
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,530
restrictions and segmentation between

1026
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,840
those applications so once me is a bad

1027
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,740
guy attacks and owns one application I

1028
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:30,470
can typically get everywhere once I have

1029
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:33,170
ownership in that data center with that

1030
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,460
I think we've got plenty of time for

1031
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:38,680
questions comments concerns

1032
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:53,810
