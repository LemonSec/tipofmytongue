[Music]

2
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:08,550
I'm gonna be talking about the modern

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,349
threat landscape and the difficulties we

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,139
face in vulnerability prioritization to

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,719
get things kicked off though when we're

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,310
talking with customers they're generally

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,260
looking for four things and their

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,180
vulnerability management program and the

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,439
first thing they obviously want to know

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,699
is where they're exposed but then I

11
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,830
think the bigger question and this is

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,880
what we're really going to dive into

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,210
quite a bit is you know what do we focus

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,989
on first and then you know how are we

15
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,969
reducing exposure over time that's

16
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:40,920
usually when you're trying to report up

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,480
and say yeah we're actually doing our

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,700
job we're getting stuff patched and then

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,230
this one sometimes it might not apply

20
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,899
I've had mixed reception for this last

21
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,000
question up in Ottawa but I know a lot

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,340
of my enterprise peers from Toronto are

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,980
asking how do we compare it's all about

24
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,449
being faster than the slowest guy

25
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:58,859
apparently when you're being chased by

26
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,170
fancy bear the the other thing that I

27
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,729
heard I was in one of the track two

28
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:07,110
meetings and the fella was talking about

29
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,630
shared responsibility and shared risk

30
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,610
and he mentioned this it seems to be

31
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,380
resonating well with everybody digital

32
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,049
transformation I think we can all agree

33
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,700
we're all going through that right now

34
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,750
and it's it's no longer a matter of you

35
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,000
know disruption it's a matter of

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,960
survival

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,700
so getting through this digital

38
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,250
transformation I'm guessing a lot of you

39
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,170
are from the government and you know I

40
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,150
know assured Services is starting to

41
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,509
look at things like cloud I actually

42
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,689
worked for a government project about 18

43
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,869
years ago now and the thought of putting

44
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,790
our stuff up in the cloud at the time

45
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,890
seemed quite amazing I like I mean the

46
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,689
cloud didn't even exist and so it's

47
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,280
great to see that that sort of stuff is

48
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,790
happening now the one thing that is a

49
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,590
big issue when I talk to people is where

50
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,899
are we exposed and and we have this

51
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,850
thing that we call the cyber exposure

52
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,280
gap you know if you're familiar with

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,810
vulnerability scanning you know that's

54
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,220
really tenable as bread-and-butter we

55
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,679
started off with necess but if you're

56
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:11,910
familiar with vulnerability scanning

57
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,920
everybody's really good at scanning

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,300
servers and desktops and network

59
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,620
infrastructure the stuff that's not

60
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,989
moving around a whole lot and you know

61
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:20,760
web web apps have been around for a

62
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,170
while I'll give you that there's lots of

63
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,810
web app skins that are out there but to

64
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,540
do a good web app scan nowadays I know

65
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,160
the web applications that are out there

66
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,510
they're meant to interact with us

67
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,580
they're not meant to interact with

68
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,340
machines so doing an automated web app

69
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,010
scan is really difficult you know and

70
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,319
each one of these presents its own issue

71
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,450
and just just referencing that other

72
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,819
talk I was in earlier they were talking

73
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,709
about cloud and how do you secure cloud

74
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,390
you know it's it's easy to spin up

75
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,769
assets in the cloud but how do you know

76
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,290
it's secure so one of the things that a

77
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,580
lot of the vulnerability management

78
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,130
teams are doing you know my I can speak

79
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,540
to my company obviously but

80
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,250
configuration compliance so that's

81
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,310
something that's out there but

82
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,720
ultimately what this is saying is you

83
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,480
know traditional VM is not doing a great

84
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,209
job except for these so there is a gap

85
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,019
that's coming out in trying to assess

86
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,150
all these four vulnerabilities and you

87
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,310
know I'm not I'm the sales engineer I

88
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,590
don't like to sell FUD but there's

89
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,049
definitely hackers going after all these

90
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:24,359
new assets that are out there and some

91
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:26,130
of these aren't even new assets if you

92
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,959
look up at the top the Industrial

93
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,329
Security sorry industrial control

94
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:33,090
systems they're really old assets but

95
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,650
all of a sudden they're connected and

96
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,720
it's possible for hackers to get in

97
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,690
there and even when it's not connected I

98
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,390
won't name names like Stuxnet but you

99
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,090
know they they find a way to get to the

100
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,450
devices they want to but I want to keep

101
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,739
everybody awake so I'm gonna ask for a

102
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,440
little audience participation out of

103
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,600
this how many vulnerabilities do you

104
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,600
think we're in 2018 anybody voting for a

105
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,890
okay I'll take that as a No

106
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:07,220
anybody do you think 9300 no okay

107
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,730
about 16,000 500 okay we got a few hands

108
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,310
there okay and then I'm guessing I'm

109
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,900
gonna get a lot of people saying 22 that

110
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,478
okay all right I I did rig this a bit

111
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,548
because I know we're in security right

112
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:22,740
we all fear the worst thank goodness it

113
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,890
wasn't that bad but it was pretty bad it

114
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,540
was sixteen thousand five

115
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,940
500 vulnerabilities last year so give

116
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,080
yourselves a pat on the back if you

117
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,090
voted for that that's that's still a

118
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,930
really big number though and the what's

119
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,740
even worse is 59% of these are

120
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,530
considered high or critical

121
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,240
vulnerabilities so that's still 10,000

122
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,340
vulnerabilities you know we're not

123
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,050
talking about finding a needle in a

124
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,640
haystack we're talking about a pile of

125
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,260
needles that you've got to figure out

126
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,540
what you have to prioritize first so

127
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,120
where do you start with that and then

128
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,950
the the other problem on top of that is

129
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,380
out of those 10,000 vulnerabilities or

130
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,770
out of this 16,000 only 7% of those were

131
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,470
actually exploitable so that means if

132
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,790
you're if you're trying to patch all

133
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,940
these you're doing an awful lot of extra

134
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,100
work and when I'm thinking about

135
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,230
vulnerability prioritization nobody

136
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,330
actually sets out to say I want to

137
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,860
prioritize on my vulnerabilities today

138
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,050
that's that's not your goal your goal is

139
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,040
to save yourself some time and effort so

140
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,440
that that's a big thing right they're

141
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,690
trying to to get from that down to that

142
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,330
and then more importantly it was even

143
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,160
less that we're actually used in cyber

144
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,280
attacks so yo you could even focus on

145
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,840
that 7% and you're still doing a lot of

146
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,320
extra work now this is what we're all

147
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,080
faced with and I haven't been in sales

148
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,820
my whole life by the way I just joined

149
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,390
about five years ago or so and so I got

150
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,000
out about 2014 and I kind of feel a

151
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,800
little lucky because it's it's like a

152
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,270
retirement for me I don't have a pager

153
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,160
and I don't have to do any of the

154
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,300
patching because there's a lot of

155
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,370
patching that's out there now you can

156
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,450
see 2017 2018 and 2019 or right on track

157
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,550
for the same level of vulnerabilities so

158
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,300
that's a lot of work and one of the the

159
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,600
big issues that we see is I think you

160
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,490
you're probably all familiar well you

161
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,660
know what I'm gonna jump ahead to one of

162
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,280
my other questions who here actually

163
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,460
does vulnerability scanning okay so we

164
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,870
got to go now who are the people that

165
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,910
get the vulnerability reports and have

166
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,910
to patch alright okay so we got a few of

167
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,460
those too I I would like to apologize on

168
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,990
behalf of the vulnerability scanners

169
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,700
whenever we just through the report over

170
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,970
and left it to your own but to talk

171
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,500
about the vulnerabilities a little bit

172
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,390
here

173
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,880
this is an example of document sweet

174
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,210
it's got a vulnerability in it that

175
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,380
allows arbitrary code to be run and you

176
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,420
know above above memory problems whatnot

177
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,420
this was given a high rating 7.8 and I'm

178
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,980
not gonna bore you with the details I

179
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,840
I've been doing workshops on this over

180
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,510
the summer but essentially this is the

181
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,510
scoring that contributes to that 7.8 now

182
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,690
here's the the trick with this this was

183
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,940
one of the top vulnerabilities used in

184
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,700
cyber attacks last year so when you

185
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,430
think about it it really shouldn't be a

186
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,370
7.8 it should be a 10 out of 10 and part

187
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,840
of the problem is the CBS s system is I

188
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,520
don't mean to say it's so harshly but

189
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,790
it's a little broken one of the reasons

190
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,380
is if you go back to the scoring here

191
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,130
this because it's a document viewer it

192
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,050
doesn't require the network so that

193
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,230
means it only gets a fairly low score on

194
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,050
the attack vector and this requires a

195
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,850
user to click on it in order for the

196
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,950
vulnerability to work so that also gives

197
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,910
it a lower score and technically it only

198
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,630
affects the document viewer but in

199
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,090
reality as I said this should be a 10

200
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,190
out of 10 because you know we all know

201
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,440
documents get sent across the network so

202
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,760
that really should make it a network

203
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,430
vulnerability and as for user

204
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,520
interaction you know we all know as much

205
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,840
as we tell people don't open those

206
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,360
attachments sometimes things slip and an

207
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,520
attachment gets open so you know what

208
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,140
really the interaction should be none

209
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,490
because everybody's curious they're

210
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,830
gonna open that document and then in

211
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,760
terms of scope change obviously there is

212
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,770
a scope change it may not be recognized

213
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,810
by the national vulnerability database

214
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,820
but there is because otherwise hackers

215
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,010
wouldn't be using this they get into the

216
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,659
document viewer and then they pivot and

217
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,330
get into the rest of your environment

218
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,360
and I always say don't take my word for

219
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,549
it you know I I'm just the sales

220
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,530
engineer I've actually had customers say

221
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,050
well you're gonna sales you lie I don't

222
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,540
take that personally but you know here's

223
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,370
here's a white paper from Carnegie

224
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,000
Mellon that was published last December

225
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,140
the

226
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,840
a very nice title called towards

227
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,150
improving CBS s but essentially the

228
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,570
document was why CBS s is broken and the

229
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,290
big thing is CBS s is based on technical

230
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,500
severity but the issue is everyone is

231
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,950
using it for organizational risk and

232
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,660
it's not meant for that and the funny

233
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,500
thing is so this is version 3.0 they're

234
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,410
talking about 3.1 just came out in June

235
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,540
I believe it was and they specifically

236
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,270
called out we are just technical

237
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:30,530
severity not organizational risk so

238
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,150
that's important thing too important

239
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,060
thing to remember so I'm gonna have just

240
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,250
an open-ended question if you feel that

241
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,230
you want to answer by all means but how

242
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,910
what are your some of your thoughts on

243
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,090
how we can improve this I don't mean to

244
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,900
put anybody on yes

245
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,590
right but it's that doesn't mean that

246
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,540
that's the risk of your environment so

247
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,870
what we have to do is is obviously we

248
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,580
can just patch it patches with me

249
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,680
because it saves a lot of time break

250
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,910
imagine a the second thing

251
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,540
reduction analysis okay which looks at

252
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,400
proximity to the edge

253
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:33,829
oh it absolutely does I was gonna say

254
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:37,339
did you see my slide deck earlier no so

255
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:39,259
yeah that's great and that that does

256
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:42,170
sound like a lot of is it do you find

257
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,639
it's a lot of manual work or do you have

258
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:46,930
ways to automate that right now

259
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,949
it's interesting you say that - because

260
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:26,359
I've had a couple of customers say well

261
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:28,220
we we don't really have time to patch so

262
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,119
why should we scan yeah yeah but but at

263
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:33,589
least you'll know your organizational

264
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:35,179
risk that's that's a great point thank

265
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:36,289
you

266
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:39,739
so talking along those same lines then

267
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:42,589
so we've we've been experimenting with

268
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:44,899
something and so this is called

269
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:47,959
predictive prioritization now I this is

270
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:49,939
a name for our product but you know it's

271
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:51,919
it I'm essentially just going to talk

272
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,749
about the process but what we're doing

273
00:11:53,749 --> 00:11:55,850
is trying to automate those workflows

274
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,889
that you were talking about and you know

275
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:59,689
especially if it's a large environment

276
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:01,459
it can be difficult and the funny thing

277
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:03,559
is even if it's a smaller environment it

278
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,209
can be just as equally difficult because

279
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:08,239
you may have just an IT guy that's doing

280
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:10,879
security you know part of the time so

281
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,679
the big thing is how can we make that

282
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:15,019
more efficient so what we've done is

283
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,699
taken a data science approach to

284
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:19,910
vulnerability management and we're we're

285
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,359
leveraging machined machine learning and

286
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:25,009
real time threat intelligence so I'll

287
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:26,509
talk a little bit more about where we're

288
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:28,879
getting those feeds from and the the

289
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:31,519
whole thing is to help you focus your

290
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,350
time and resources because you've got

291
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,029
limited time to do things in your

292
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:37,069
environment obviously I'm sure nobody

293
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:39,439
can just go in and patch if you're one

294
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:40,669
of those lucky ones where you can apply

295
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:44,209
all the patches go forward please do it

296
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:45,980
as much as you can because it's a rough

297
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,919
world out there so weak in our product

298
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:49,730
we call this vulnerability

299
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,369
prioritization but really it's it's

300
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:56,480
taking the CBS s framework which was

301
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,220
actually pretty good you know as much as

302
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,739
CBS s bang on it because it's just

303
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,470
technical severity it's not bad where

304
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,789
they were a little lacking was in a

305
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:06,649
threat score because the national

306
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:08,569
vulnerability database are the people

307
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:12,439
that use the CBS s system and their best

308
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:13,879
effort they say that on their website

309
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,649
they're open about it I mean there's

310
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:18,169
times I've there's an example coming up

311
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:20,600
where they took 70 days to put out a

312
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,579
score so you can see they're a little

313
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:25,039
overworked and the other thing is

314
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:27,859
because they're you know doing best

315
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:30,369
effort they're not getting a threat feed

316
00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:32,389
doing daily

317
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:34,129
so that that's what we've done with our

318
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:36,889
machine learning model we take the CBS s

319
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:39,529
impact score in scope and then instead

320
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:42,319
take in our threat data from various

321
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:44,839
sources and replace the threat score and

322
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:47,149
CBS s so what we're doing is giving you

323
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:50,089
a similar score zero to ten but with

324
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:52,129
some machine learning intelligence built

325
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,860
into it so it's things like looking at

326
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,649
the threat actors that are using this

327
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:02,259
vulnerability how the vulnerability

328
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,009
obviously it's been made by a

329
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,870
manufacturer how broad is the coverage

330
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,300
of that product you know if it's a you

331
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,889
know I know Microsoft's out there so

332
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:11,360
don't tell them I'm bashing them I'm not

333
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,670
but you know they've got a big product

334
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,240
range

335
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,980
everybody's got Microsoft in their

336
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,470
environment so if there's a Microsoft

337
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,959
vulnerability it's going to be much more

338
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,120
severe than you know if you've got a

339
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,730
vulnerability on AIX so just a couple of

340
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,319
examples here here's some data science

341
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:33,230
in action so this is an example of if

342
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,999
you look down here this is a CBS s8 so

343
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:40,519
it's a high vulnerability we rated it a

344
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,170
little differently we considered it a

345
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,620
critical 9.6 but you can see why and the

346
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,300
threat recency on this was in the last

347
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,449
week the threat intensity is high so

348
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:51,980
there's a lot of people out there doing

349
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,319
things with it and most importantly

350
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:55,879
probably the exploit code maturity is

351
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:58,970
high the age of the vulnerability it's

352
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,910
relatively young so you know that's

353
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,170
probably why we didn't give it a ten out

354
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,399
of ten but we're seeing dark web and

355
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,120
underground communication on it and part

356
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,829
of that is we're taking and we're

357
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,009
obviously taking in various feeds

358
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:17,389
recorder future is a big partner of ours

359
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:19,370
we also have our own research team

360
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,620
that's looking into this so that's where

361
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,240
you see security research and whatnot

362
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,569
but where it gets interesting is here's

363
00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:28,639
a medium vulnerability you can see by

364
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,089
the CBS s down here I mean I won't ask

365
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:33,980
actually I usually ask how many people

366
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,480
actually get around to patching they're

367
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,040
medium severity vulnerabilities because

368
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,809
I've had customers they're like we're

369
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:41,000
lucky if we can get to all the highs and

370
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,549
criticals so the mediums aren't even

371
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:45,830
something on their minds usually

372
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,600
but it's sure on the mind of the hackers

373
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,510
this is a nine point four in terms of

374
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:55,670
criticality part of the reason there is

375
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,340
the vulnerability has been around for at

376
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,770
least a half year there is some proof of

377
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,350
concept exploit code out there might be

378
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,900
a little difficult for for me or you

379
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,060
know your average person to leverage but

380
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,450
the hackers know how to leverage it and

381
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:13,100
then you know there is talk of it on

382
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,350
various sources not specifically the

383
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,330
dark web but you know so that all this

384
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,680
gets plugged into the machine learning

385
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,290
and we'll talk a little bit more how

386
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,870
that actually works but so it ends up

387
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,700
that this is actually an important fall

388
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,530
neural 'ti even though it's a medium and

389
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,840
then you have critical vulnerabilities

390
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,240
that are not actually critical so CBS s

391
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,310
down here it said this is a critical

392
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,230
vulnerability but if you look at this

393
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,960
one the machine learning model actually

394
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,180
said no this is just a medium because

395
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,520
the threat intensity is very low there's

396
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,700
improvement exploit code age of the

397
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,620
vulnerability may be it may have been

398
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,060
around for a while and even though the

399
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,680
product coverage is high there's no

400
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,590
sources talking about this no one

401
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,750
there's probably quite a few hackers

402
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,300
around here or pen testers you have your

403
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,860
go-to vulnerabilities if you're a pen

404
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,450
tester you know you've got three to five

405
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,920
in your tool kit you know really well

406
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,730
and you just use those you know so this

407
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,869
was probably not one of those

408
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,310
vulnerabilities that people were really

409
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:14,209
caring about now to get back to that

410
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:16,069
record of future report these are the

411
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,470
top five vulnerabilities from that

412
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,510
report in 2018 so these are the

413
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,400
vulnerabilities being used in cyber

414
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,819
attacks and malware but if you look at

415
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:28,520
either version two or version three of

416
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,670
that CVS s most of these are scored is

417
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,460
as just heís not criticals even though

418
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,710
these were the vulnerabilities these

419
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,920
were the go twos for the hackers whereas

420
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,240
the machine learning actually does come

421
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,950
out with values that are much more

422
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,950
relevant to that and the interesting

423
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,240
thing too is when you get into an

424
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,150
automated process of this where we're

425
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,390
updating daily you get a much more

426
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:57,020
interesting threat score where you know

427
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,580
when the vulnerability first comes out

428
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,389
nobody

429
00:17:59,389 --> 00:18:00,950
thinking much of it but as soon as

430
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,079
there's dark web information the the

431
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:05,419
machine says just kick that up this is

432
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:08,389
an important bill nobility and as I

433
00:18:08,389 --> 00:18:10,009
mention you know hackers they've got

434
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:12,499
their go to so it may be that okay they

435
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:14,450
try this out and they think it's not

436
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,009
gonna be actually all that good so we're

437
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:18,769
gonna lower that vulnerability over time

438
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:21,709
but in this particular example all of a

439
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:24,169
sudden it became relevant again and the

440
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,739
dark web kicks back up now when we apply

441
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:31,009
this to all the vulnerabilities and we

442
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,869
did train it on all the vulnerabilities

443
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:34,389
with all the threat intelligence we had

444
00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:37,820
that that sixty percent that are high

445
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,549
and critical end up getting shrunk to

446
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:42,139
this little bit over here you can barely

447
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:44,659
even see the critical list there and the

448
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:48,859
highs are much more relevant and I will

449
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:52,399
fully state that you know I'm not gonna

450
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:55,369
say don't patch these but if you are

451
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:57,679
pressed for time these are the ones you

452
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,509
want to focus on first these are going

453
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:03,919
to help keep you out of the news so

454
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,169
let's get back to those two or four

455
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:10,999
questions that I mentioned so we've

456
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:12,709
talked about you know obviously we're

457
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:14,389
we're you exposed just do some

458
00:19:14,389 --> 00:19:15,859
vulnerability scanning you can find that

459
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:17,749
out but what should you focus on first

460
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:19,070
well that's what we just talked about

461
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,999
now let's focus on these last two how

462
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:26,149
are we reducing over time and how do we

463
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:30,679
compare to our peers and this is where I

464
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:33,679
I'm guilty of doing this when somebody

465
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,979
asks how secure are we they don't want a

466
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:40,899
vulnerability report of 300 pages long

467
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:42,859
it's probably one of the reasons why I

468
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:45,320
should it's it was a good thing I got

469
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,159
out of operations when I did but you

470
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:52,450
know so what we're looking at next is

471
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,999
another machine learning method to help

472
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:58,219
prioritize or to help to communicate

473
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:01,489
that 300 pages so the first thing that's

474
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:05,869
going to do is calculate all the risk

475
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:08,179
based on not just the vulnerabilities

476
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:10,969
and the the threat intelligence but also

477
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:12,980
the asset criticality so

478
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,540
back to your point I mean it's really

479
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,190
important to have that asset criticality

480
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,660
your CEO or you know a DMS console is

481
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,669
going to be much more important than you

482
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:25,270
know the front desk

483
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:28,520
then we're gonna there's a way that we

484
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,590
can communicate all this that's going to

485
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,620
be easy to understand for all the upper

486
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,840
levels that might not be savvy on

487
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,850
vulnerability management you know they

488
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,620
don't want to hear all the details

489
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,419
and then finally give you a way to

490
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:43,970
compare against those peers if that's

491
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,360
something you want to do now the way

492
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,510
we've gone about doing this of course

493
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:52,100
machine learning requires a lot of data

494
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,450
and the more data you can have the

495
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,910
better so over the last three years or

496
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,340
so we've gotten a four point five

497
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,910
petabyte data Lake about this we're

498
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,380
looking because we've got a cloud

499
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,030
service and that may not be obviously

500
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,950
something that everyone in this room is

501
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,140
interested in but those who are using

502
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,049
the cloud service we're seeing 1.5

503
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:16,340
billion vulnerabilities per week and we

504
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,690
already mentioned there's some of those

505
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,580
data sources we're bringing in so we've

506
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,919
got eight third-party data sources I

507
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,500
think it's actually ten now they vary we

508
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,059
rate those data sources as they're

509
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:29,059
coming in but so we take in all this

510
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:30,440
vulnerability information to prioritize

511
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,440
it and then add that asset criticality

512
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,820
and we also can add in business context

513
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,590
and I'll talk about how we do that but

514
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,360
first I wanted to talk a little bit

515
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,559
about the asset criticality portion so

516
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,419
what we call it is asset criticality

517
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:49,340
rating but really what this is looking

518
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,620
at is the business purpose of that

519
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,490
device the type of device it is

520
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,080
obviously connectivity is important is

521
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,910
this thing connected to the Internet

522
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,059
does it have a public IP or something

523
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:03,980
capabilities of a location and maybe

524
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,850
even some third party data and what ends

525
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,760
up happening is we for all of our assets

526
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,090
we can end up with a way to categorize

527
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,910
them automatically and I had a customer

528
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,799
asked me this recently is it is it

529
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,730
always right and I will always cavy it

530
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,070
that way it's a machine it's not always

531
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,660
ever going to be right

532
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,010
that's why we have this little pencil

533
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,660
beside the rating there so if you want

534
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,190
to adjust it yourself you can certainly

535
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,380
do that but you know here's an example

536
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,510
of how it would go about doing this in

537
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:39,290
this case we've got a it sees that it's

538
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,600
a general-purpose device but because

539
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,000
it's doing vulnerability scanning it's

540
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,950
also able to see a this is a mail server

541
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,540
and a database server in a file server

542
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,120
so this seems like it might be something

543
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,540
important we're gonna kick that up and

544
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,679
you know I didn't put it right up to a

545
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:57,710
ten because it's just internal but if it

546
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,410
was external it would definitely go up

547
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:03,140
higher and then talking about the

548
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,460
business context I mentioned earlier we

549
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,000
have right here the ability to tag and

550
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,340
if you're gonna do tagging definitely

551
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,290
have automatic rules to help you out

552
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,520
because if you've got a big environment

553
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,260
it's gonna take a long time for you to

554
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,550
tag all this sort of stuff but

555
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,470
definitely get in there like what the

556
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,600
business unit is where it might be

557
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,690
geographically located because as you

558
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,309
might be aware there are certain threats

559
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:29,750
where they focus on a particular

560
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,700
continent and we might never see him

561
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,300
here in Canada so this is an important

562
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,980
thing get that asset criticality in

563
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,800
there and one feature that we we have is

564
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,390
the the categorization as I mentioned

565
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,070
it's a zero to ten so we're able to say

566
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,750
okay this is a critical asset this isn't

567
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,370
but the one thing I wanted to point out

568
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,160
is if you're ever doing something like

569
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,460
this if you can't categorize it it means

570
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,650
you're not scanning it enough so there's

571
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,150
if you're familiar with vulnerability

572
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,500
scanning there's you know you can just

573
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,090
do the network scanning side of things

574
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,410
where you're you're you've got the

575
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,510
attackers view as we call it but then

576
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,800
there's also what we call the owners

577
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,270
view where you're you logging in with

578
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,670
credentials and you're seeing exactly

579
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,530
the software that's on there because if

580
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,750
you think about it a network based

581
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,520
vulnerability scan I can say yeah

582
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,960
there's a webserver on there and it's

583
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,380
vulnerable but I can't tell you if I

584
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,970
just do a network scan there's a

585
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,440
workstation there and it's got Adobe

586
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,210
Flash on it and if somebody clicks on

587
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,730
something it might use that

588
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,220
vulnerability the only way to see that

589
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:36,050
is through credential scanning oh I got

590
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,429
a love technical difficulties there we

591
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:39,210
go all right

592
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,350
I've got to stop moving around I think

593
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,950
I'm building up a static charge here

594
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,410
alright so when we take the

595
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,460
vulnerability priority based on threat

596
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,930
intelligence and then the asset

597
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,230
criticality together we're able to get a

598
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,350
much better idea of what's going on in

599
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,510
the environment

600
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,620
now I already asked this one so I'm

601
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,740
gonna skip over that one but to get back

602
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,560
to the people that have to patch the the

603
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,910
other important thing that you're gonna

604
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,830
want it's not just a vulnerability list

605
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,240
that you're looking for and and this is

606
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,280
where I'm kind of apologizing to all the

607
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,480
people I ever worked with

608
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,130
where I just threw a vulnerability to

609
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,010
report over to them and said go fix this

610
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:20,230
because they don't have time and again

611
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,880
this all comes back to trying to save

612
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,580
time so what you really need is a list

613
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:29,440
of what do I actually do so with the all

614
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,840
this model that we've been working on we

615
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,790
also come up with the what we call the

616
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,110
solutions list instead of just a

617
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,120
vulnerability list so trying to up that

618
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,100
game a little bit making it easier you

619
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,950
know so instead of you know your Adobe

620
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,630
being vulnerable we're saying you have

621
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:46,510
to patch it to this version or later so

622
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,640
it makes things much more effective and

623
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,160
then you can see oh if I apply this if I

624
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,780
do this thing in my environment it's

625
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,510
going to get rid of 300 vulnerabilities

626
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,840
and that's going to reduce the risk a

627
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,770
lot so what we call all this with the

628
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,570
the vulnerability rating the threat

629
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,430
intelligence the asset criticality we

630
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:09,160
call this a cyber exposure score and the

631
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,280
way we've done it is it's like a credit

632
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,830
score for your environment only really

633
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:19,120
high is really vulnerable low being very

634
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,850
much secure and it's never a race to

635
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,550
zero as much as it's a great idea you're

636
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,220
never going to get to zero but it's good

637
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,150
to have goals and in this example you

638
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,010
know this particular environments got a

639
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:36,580
medium in terms of its cyber exposure

640
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,850
score and then you can see compared to

641
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:43,750
say public services 728 so doing better

642
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,670
than the average public service and

643
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,010
doing better than the tenable population

644
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,530
as a whole that we're aware of so a good

645
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,330
way to to rate yourself against your

646
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:52,820
peers

647
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,070
the this would be your entire

648
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,230
environment yeah all the assets all the

649
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,050
vulnerabilities but there's a coming up

650
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,430
I'm going to show you how you can break

651
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,920
that down by business unit yeah so you

652
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,050
can take the same score and then track

653
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,360
that over time of course so you can see

654
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,110
how things are doing and then getting to

655
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,850
that business context so if you get

656
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,170
everything tagged properly and

657
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,180
categorized and and that may seem like a

658
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,410
big thing if you've got a big

659
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,360
environment but that's where the

660
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,890
automatic rules definitely come into

661
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,230
play then you can say alright here's my

662
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,750
organization up top it's got that 601

663
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,690
score so not too bad but let's dive into

664
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,250
it and see how all my different

665
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,050
departments are doing and you can slice

666
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,400
and dice that however you want so

667
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,060
whether it's by geographic location or

668
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:40,370
maybe operational you know operational

669
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,760
teams or line of business

670
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,710
it's basically your imagination in terms

671
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,360
of how you want to take things and then

672
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,180
break down those those tags but that

673
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,950
lets you say okay well you know I'm

674
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,350
doing our rate across the organization

675
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,120
in general and in this particular

676
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,010
example New York was doing really good

677
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,400
but London needed some work so it allows

678
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,500
you to show where you might need to

679
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,130
focus your remediation efforts and then

680
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,660
this is obviously very high level so

681
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,670
this would be you know director general

682
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:14,690
or just general manager sort of view but

683
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,660
there's also ways to dig into that data

684
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,610
and then see well here's here's all our

685
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,140
vulnerabilities by the threat

686
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,050
intelligence and then here's also the

687
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,480
asset criticality scores and so you know

688
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,600
right there top right or top left your

689
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,190
that's where you want to focus your

690
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,050
scores on so it's really going to make

691
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:37,400
things more efficient for you and then

692
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,080
the last part I think that is really

693
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,600
important a lot of people ask how are we

694
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,130
doing in terms of cyber hygiene so this

695
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,230
speaks to you know how often I'm

696
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,150
actually scanning assets this is

697
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:53,120
something you know we all one of the

698
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,710
reasons I got into sales was I wanted to

699
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,090
see how other people were doing it you

700
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:58,310
know I worked the last place I worked

701
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,900
out I was there for five years and I

702
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,090
really didn't feel like I was making

703
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,130
improvement I know I was but it

704
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,430
sometimes felt like I was

705
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,680
so I wanted to get out and talk to other

706
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,330
people and see how they're doing and you

707
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,800
know it was the same thing everywhere

708
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,590
they you're working your silos you don't

709
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,150
really know how you're doing compared to

710
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:16,990
everybody else

711
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:20,830
well this is a great way to tell you so

712
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,090
you can see in this particular

713
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,100
environment where we're on the light

714
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,350
blue I'm actually not doing too bad when

715
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,590
you compare me to all the other peers so

716
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,510
you know I'm I'm scanning most of my

717
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,420
stuff at least once a week there there

718
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,800
are some things where I could improve

719
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,050
I'm not scanning all that frequently and

720
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:41,080
then in terms of vulnerability age you

721
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,790
know I would say not doing too bad here

722
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,670
I oldest vulnerabilities in general is

723
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,550
about between one and two weeks you know

724
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,310
there's a couple there probably I had to

725
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,500
accept those risks but you know there's

726
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,740
a couple they're a little older but yeah

727
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,680
so they you get some key insights it's

728
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,150
not just about scanning the

729
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,350
vulnerabilities and throwing the list

730
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,710
over the operations team so with that

731
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,350
I'm gonna close up here and if you have

732
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,300
any questions I actually meant to say if

733
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,150
you have any questions during the

734
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,260
presentation please ask them but you

735
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,730
know well we'll save them until now then

736
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,500
so any questions

737
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:34,089
