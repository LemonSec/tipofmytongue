1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,299
[Music]

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,360
the next 45 minutes or so

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,740
we're going to talk about reverse

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,580
engineering with NSA's Deidre and so

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,890
that I can best deliver this information

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,590
to you I need to kind of know where your

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,970
backgrounds coming from which is always

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,269
a tricky situation so I guess I'll just

9
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:27,599
ask how many people here show hands have

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,189
reverse engineer on their resume yeah

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,910
okay I'm prepared for a variance of

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,850
different backgrounds so I hope everyone

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,520
will get something valuable out of this

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,219
let me start off by saying there's no

15
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,190
classified material in this brief

16
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,770
nothing derivative nothing copied

17
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,149
everything here has been generated since

18
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,660
the public release of gira I don't know

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,520
about you if you've ever gone to a

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,649
hacker conference before taking a CD

21
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,719
home put it on the shared server and it

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,129
has like a bunch of copied and pasted

23
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,549
stuff from WikiLeaks

24
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:12,030
yeah me neither so so just a heads up

25
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,460
there okay a little bit about me I work

26
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,159
at Boston cybernetics Institute a fairly

27
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,680
new place I'm a co-founder and technical

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,939
staff there I used to work at Lincoln

29
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,320
Laboratory got my grad degree master's

30
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,689
at RPI and I had the pleasure of serving

31
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,939
the United States Marine Corps 2002-2006

32
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,030
served in Operation Iraqi Freedom served

33
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,610
along some Canadians too although I

34
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,720
can't remember I was thinking about

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,680
early this morning what the name of the

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,380
base was it was a the one with like

37
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,909
ancient ruins in it and I swear I can't

38
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,189
remember what it was but wherever the

39
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,799
Tower of Babel was but said he that was

40
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,149
anyways I start with some Canadians

41
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,960
there

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,590
okay so BCI where I work

43
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,520
we're a public benefit corporation

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,460
founded November 2nd 2017 we're located

45
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,500
next to Harvard University and we do

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,920
trainings on reversing exploitation

47
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,909
specialized embedded systems since

48
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,570
that's where big demand is and funny

49
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,239
enough November 2nd is actually the

50
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,720
anniversary of the Morris worm from like

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,390
19

52
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,240
87 or 89 or something like that so is it

53
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,410
a coincidence that we founded our

54
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,880
company the same day I don't know but

55
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,690
you can't prove anything

56
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,770
so just leave it at that okay so this is

57
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,780
outline for today we're gonna talk about

58
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,950
I'm gonna give you little background

59
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,170
what key drew is just like a few slides

60
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,870
and reverse engineering and then most of

61
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,630
the time I'm gonna spend demonstrating

62
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,700
things in goodra so you get to see it

63
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,200
live and I guess how much speaker right

64
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,370
so they can ask questions

65
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,920
it's my format right okay so yeah I mean

66
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,120
if you got a question or something you

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,810
can just you know pop one up when if I

68
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,480
didn't explain something clearly enough

69
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,600
okay so what Sidra well to quote the NSA

70
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,720
pronounced Nyssa by the way that's

71
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,250
that's from from their PR department

72
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,070
told me that so it's a software reverse

73
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,930
engineering suite of tools it's free and

74
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,580
open-source it's written in Java which

75
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,230
is great because that means it runs on

76
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,360
anything it's available and github now

77
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,060
or you go to NSA gov and I will make all

78
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,270
these slides available on github and I

79
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,310
have a track record of doing that so if

80
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,990
you just because I know everyone's heard

81
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,160
that before and then the slides number

82
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,910
make it up I will make sure they make it

83
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,400
up

84
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,350
okay so guitro was released publicly

85
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,560
March 5th 2019 at RSA Conference so

86
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,610
that's just really this year about six

87
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,250
months ago title come get your free and

88
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,320
assay reverse engineering tool so kudos

89
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,670
to the PR department that came up with

90
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,910
that that's pretty cool and it was a the

91
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,780
speaker there was Rob Joyce okay so and

92
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,650
this is just some of the version

93
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,850
releases just to let you know like how

94
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,720
fast it's being updated the dates don't

95
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,910
match really up to anything though like

96
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,980
the first release here says February

97
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,930
28th but it wasn't released till March

98
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,180
5th like publicly so I don't know me it

99
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,160
was like an eternal commit or something

100
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,980
but they're pretty active as far as

101
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,589
addressing get like issues and fixing

102
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,769
things there's all sorts of like

103
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,790
interesting problems when it first came

104
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,720
out which they've done a pretty good job

105
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,570
of addressing and as far as a history

106
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,430
and I got to give credit here to Alexey

107
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,570
bolas L

108
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,860
so he and I worked did some work

109
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,060
together so if you do a grep for like

110
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,550
strings formatted in like date

111
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,700
parameters through the the Java code of

112
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,980
gira a lot of interesting dates pop out

113
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,110
a lot of them in the late 90s so it

114
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,880
seems to suggest that the tool has been

115
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,570
developed for 20 years or so although

116
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,850
what is much more strongly suggestive of

117
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,350
the long development period is the

118
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,300
quality and the huge body of work which

119
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,610
will dive into but that's just the fun

120
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,620
thing so run grep over it and see what

121
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,360
pops out okay if Ghidorah really means

122
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,440
nothing to you if you've never seen it

123
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,910
before and ever heard of it it's related

124
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,440
to these tools so if you've heard of

125
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,610
like AI de binary ninja or da-rae or r2

126
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,000
so Ida in binary ninja have free and

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,140
commercial versions r2 is just free with

128
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,910
contrasting that to be Draghi gia is

129
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,040
just free completely free open-source

130
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,680
you do whatever you want with it maybe

131
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,810
somebody will do us all a favor and make

132
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,950
the commercial version have some

133
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,380
commercial support that'd be nice but we

134
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,850
haven't seen that yet so here's some of

135
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,550
the related tools you want to see a

136
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,100
detailed comparison I'd recommend the

137
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,750
website from Rodari which is just the

138
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,980
bottom right hand corner there if you

139
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,150
just go to you know Google Road ara it's

140
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,950
like their homepage they have a detailed

141
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,100
comparison which they label quote the

142
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,050
unfair comparison between our two Ida

143
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,000
Pro and hopper they have not updated it

144
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,410
does include goodra if you look on the

145
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,300
far right side well they have like a

146
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,700
it's like page after page after page of

147
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,680
detailed comparisons

148
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,450
although unfair so you know just take

149
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,050
that they say it's unfair zone but it's

150
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,370
just if you want all the detailed

151
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,410
information this is the place to go get

152
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,950
it I hope today that I can maybe lower

153
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,930
the barrier of intimidation of picking

154
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,910
up the tool yourself maybe you can pick

155
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,800
up a few gems here and there things you

156
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,990
haven't seen about the tool yet and then

157
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:19,950
I'm gonna be around you the rest of the

158
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,450
day and tomorrow if anyone wants to like

159
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,390
you know deep dive into Ghidorah talk

160
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,980
about some you know real technical

161
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,360
questions okay now this is for the few

162
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,530
people who have never done reverse

163
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,480
engineering before it's like 3-4 slide

164
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,760
so just bear with me you know to explain

165
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,590
what reverse engineering is so forward

166
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,540
engineering if you think about this as

167
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,070
like spectrum of programming abstract

168
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,320
on the left side you have you know

169
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,090
abstract so this is like your

170
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,740
requirements document this is like the

171
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,300
summary this is the human language

172
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,580
written and the far other side the

173
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,130
concrete side is the binary this is the

174
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,380
thing you ship out and the process to go

175
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,490
between those you know maybe you have a

176
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,870
human that takes the requirements make

177
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,400
pseudocode or UML diagrams or

178
00:06:59,400 --> 00:06:59,850
what-have-you

179
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,160
from their pseudocode you may have a

180
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,020
tool assist or another just human

181
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,670
generated process to do see source code

182
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,770
and then finally you know do a compiler

183
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,720
assembler all the way down to a binary

184
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,640
well reverse-engineering

185
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,340
is the other way around and a funny

186
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,510
thing is I've only heard reverse

187
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,790
engineers call this forward engineering

188
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,140
or everyone else just calls it like

189
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,240
software development but when you're

190
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,240
reverse engineer it's you find it's a

191
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,730
helpful qualifier to know so reverse

192
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,420
engineering is is the other way so this

193
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,190
is kind of like a you are here situation

194
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,880
he's like you're just given a binary and

195
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,080
somebody asks you a question but that

196
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,790
question came from the far other end of

197
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,800
the end of the spectrum so they're like

198
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,020
what does this program do you know like

199
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,830
well okay how BIG's my team how long do

200
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,870
I have what do you need it to do you

201
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,550
know these are like one of several

202
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,980
questions you could ask what does this

203
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,420
program do you could ask other questions

204
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,210
too you know a little speiser questions

205
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,020
like who made this program or did we

206
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,390
make this program and now people other

207
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,650
people are using it like that's a

208
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,670
question some people have to ask

209
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,470
themselves sometimes to write if you

210
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,630
read the news or maybe you'll say like

211
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,460
you know what are the hidden

212
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,420
capabilities in this program that were

213
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,370
unintended and now we'd like to use to

214
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,870
our advantage there's a lot of questions

215
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,540
you can ask so reverse engineers start

216
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,430
over here this is like the forward

217
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,340
engineering reverse engineers just go

218
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,830
the other way so you start there with

219
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,200
the binary then you have like a

220
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,539
disassembler then you go from assembly

221
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,280
to see source code or something

222
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,110
approximating it using a D compiler and

223
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,250
then you'll

224
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,440
as of right now we still have to use a

225
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,020
human to take it from the D compiled

226
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,000
code all the way up to that executive

227
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,140
summary that's gonna land on someone's

228
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,670
desk and people are going to make big

229
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,210
decisions based on so today's talk

230
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,490
deidre is about those two big red

231
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,780
on the right so Deidre is a disassembler

232
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,540
and decompiler and a whole lot more that

233
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,550
goes with it but that's primarily what

234
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,780
it does so it's just a little bit of

235
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,940
context about what reverse engineering

236
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,860
is and what Ghidorah can do for you all

237
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,250
right now we get to go see some Deidre

238
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:26,230
stuff so all right so I got goodra it's

239
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,200
on the desktop here double click it

240
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,780
keeps yours open it

241
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,850
alright that's that's visible okay so

242
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,400
we've opened goodra we have no active

243
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,680
project it's you it takes a like

244
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,100
actually get to the fun part but this

245
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,810
the first up here is you gonna open this

246
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,490
up now that we have this we're gonna

247
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,600
start a new project and we'll call this

248
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,180
C call this countermeasure 20 19-1 okay

249
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,610
we got a project but we have no binaries

250
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,900
or anything in the project so we need to

251
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,330
import something so I'll just do I for

252
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,140
import and let's see I have a bunch of

253
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,830
exercises publicly exercises publicly

254
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,950
available exercises here so let's see so

255
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:15,730
the first thing we're do is we're gonna

256
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,340
import this binary Dedra is gonna do a

257
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,130
little bit of parsing for it let's say

258
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,400
you can I alright there we go yeah okay

259
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,310
there we go first thing I do is I change

260
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,900
all the fonts on all my computer's now I

261
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,700
don't have to wear glasses or maybe I do

262
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,440
but I just refuse I don't know it's one

263
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,340
of the two so G drew identifies it with

264
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,900
this basic parsing information you know

265
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,790
looks like the the magic numbers the

266
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,840
headers things like that okay it's an

267
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,680
elf file it's written an arm so say ok

268
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,170
and now it's gonna give us just a little

269
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,420
bit more of the metadata of like you

270
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,440
know what's going on with this binary

271
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,570
good for record-keeping ok yeah now

272
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,100
we've imported a binary now let's

273
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,310
actually we're like so close to the fun

274
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,840
stuff so I'm gonna double click this now

275
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,250
and what it's going to do is you can

276
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,910
open up the one of the tools so there's

277
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,309
a tool chest here

278
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:12,369
deidre is like modules and extensions

279
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:14,139
and scripts and tools and everything is

280
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:18,999
like composable but the main tool right

281
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:20,800
here is gonna be the code browser so I'm

282
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,910
gonna double click this dragon coming at

283
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,939
you be careful okay so now it's gonna

284
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:29,980
say has not been analyzed yes let's

285
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,809
analyze it now and here you're find

286
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:37,739
here's a lot of here's a lot of default

287
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,660
analyses that will be done and these are

288
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,420
all configurable you can write your own

289
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,379
you might already have internal

290
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:45,879
processes right now to automate this

291
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,009
process so we're just gonna go with the

292
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:54,429
defaults will hit analyze okay not quite

293
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:56,769
any of the pizzazz or hype just yet but

294
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:59,410
at least we're finally in the tool with

295
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,139
the code and all these intriguing icons

296
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,689
up here that does you know who knows

297
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:05,829
what so we'll figure it out

298
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:08,079
okay so if I wanted to reverse engineer

299
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,899
this binary I guess the first thing I'd

300
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:13,199
do is I'd probably run the binary so

301
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,069
there it is it just asked me for a

302
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:17,410
password this is like a introductory

303
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,230
training exercise we do so it just

304
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,429
simulates you know it's a program just

305
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:22,420
ask you for your password so you gotta

306
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:28,360
figure it out so what we'll do is we'll

307
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,730
look for all the ASCII strings in the

308
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,899
binary so up here under window

309
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,290
see it says defined strengths like that

310
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,929
and now we have this string window pop

311
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:44,110
up over here yeah let's see let's go

312
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,749
down a little bit and I see

313
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,600
your password you got it G Mon start I

314
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,240
don't know if this is so we'll see okay

315
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,350
so if we want to figure out what this

316
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,470
program is doing I will start off with

317
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,089
enter password since that's an indicator

318
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:04,220
I got by running the program that at

319
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,020
least is being accessed and used in some

320
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,630
capacity so what I'll do is I'll click

321
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,540
on this and over here on this window

322
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,660
this big window this is like the well

323
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,950
it's called a listing window but it's

324
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,870
it's kind of like the main window it's

325
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,339
the one that contains the code it's the

326
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:21,080
one that you'll most often be spending

327
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,440
time in and what you see that it's done

328
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,230
by clicking on the string it's jumped me

329
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,410
over here to where that string is stored

330
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,500
in memory okay so I don't really care

331
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,089
about so much about where it's stored

332
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:36,470
it's probably stored in the data section

333
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,120
and read-only data whatever I care about

334
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,110
where it's being used so my next up here

335
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,279
is I'm gonna say okay well where is it

336
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,110
being used so I'm gonna click on the

337
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,890
symbol go to references here and then

338
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,810
down here it says show references to

339
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,330
control shift F and for those of you who

340
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,930
ever use Ida Pro it's like hitting X for

341
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,750
cross references and also for those of

342
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,810
you who use Ida Pro all of the hotkeys

343
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,890
are detrimental to my psyche they're all

344
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,050
like going the wrong way though the

345
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,170
wrong buttons it's like instead of C for

346
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,820
code in Ida

347
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,930
it's like C is clear and in Dedra and

348
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,430
it's like that's not what I want I want

349
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,670
code but so anyways what I'm saying is I

350
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,339
have a list of key bindings for goodra

351
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:31,310
they are directly taken from Ida so for

352
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,750
those of you who use I too often and you

353
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,070
don't want to learn a second set of key

354
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,190
bindings I've already kind of started on

355
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:40,870
that problem for you okay tangent over

356
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,520
so I found this string now I want to do

357
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,839
a cross reference of where the strings

358
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:46,670
being used which I've done here I click

359
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,830
on this it takes me to the part of the

360
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,450
code in which this string is being used

361
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,600
okay

362
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,900
and now this is sort of like let's get

363
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,870
to the the pizzazz the little the moment

364
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,270
where why is Gita so hyped up which is

365
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,010
all

366
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,520
this code here can be cryptic if you've

367
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,680
never studied arm code before and you

368
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,160
may have trouble reading this so the big

369
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,980
thing about gr l is the D compiler so

370
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,250
what I'm gonna do is up here displayed

371
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,380
you compiler and now on the right side

372
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,210
come on we can do it let's do it

373
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:25,800
together

374
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,590
trackpad okay well over here this is

375
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:37,000
that's like the moneymaker of Deidre so

376
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,170
taking a program back to source code

377
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,330
it's done so pretty easily

378
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:46,060
and it can do this for many different

379
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,430
architectures and for the architectures

380
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,310
it cannot do it for it makes it pretty

381
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,760
easy for people to write their own

382
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,890
processors so that Ghidorah can then

383
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,640
disassemble it and then lift it to the

384
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,950
pseudocode or the the c compiler so

385
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,320
that's sort of like the big part of

386
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,180
Sidra and then what we'll do is we'll

387
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,400
talk about some of the details how you

388
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,090
might use this and I guess where you

389
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,510
might go from here but I guess first we

390
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,340
got to figure out what well what is that

391
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,370
password so it's clean this code up a

392
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,440
little bit because Cedro doesn't finish

393
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,610
everything for you let's see here in the

394
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,340
code it's a stack check guard to local

395
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:34,900
see local see that would I usually

396
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,850
change the variable names of any of any

397
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,230
variable name that I would say like

398
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,180
would you yell at your colleague for

399
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,520
naming their variable this if you would

400
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,590
then you need to change it it's kind of

401
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,210
like tell students so okay so let's

402
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,190
rename this and I'll rename this to

403
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,400
canary and then let's see we got a

404
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,200
string compare let's see printf enter

405
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,060
password scanf % s AC stack 32 i don't

406
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,230
think any of my colleagues would name

407
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,720
something that so

408
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,310
let's rename that one will go user input

409
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:12,869
okay and now we see string compare to

410
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,140
you

411
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,670
compared to the static string gotta

412
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:20,140
start somewhere okay so let me copy this

413
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,040
oh no it copied the quotes too

414
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:32,200
I don't want the cause let's copy this

415
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,780
over here and now run the program I'll

416
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:42,510
do ctrl shift V you got it yay right so

417
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,650
except you know the idea here is just a

418
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,510
simulation but you could imagine it it

419
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:52,510
is a serial number or it's a I don't

420
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,760
know you can can use your imagination

421
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,940
whatever you want for right okay so

422
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,830
that's sort of taking you to the basics

423
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:04,750
of opening a project importing a binary

424
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,370
let's walk through it

425
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,810
let's find strings let's cross our frets

426
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:11,440
and things like that but that's just

427
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,350
like just the beginning but this is sort

428
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:17,020
of like the big pipe that's you got you

429
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,810
got it does it and it's pretty easy to

430
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,790
install there's lots of fun exercises

431
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,730
online if you want to get started you

432
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,170
know this just this is me speaking as a

433
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,700
teacher a lot of times reverse

434
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,200
engineering it's like can be very

435
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,450
intimidating to people but anybody who

436
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,640
likes to solve puzzles would love

437
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,220
reversing and people they so many people

438
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,480
love reversing so much they get obsessed

439
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,730
about it like I didn't sure a lot of

440
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:40,710
people do here at their cybersecurity

441
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,480
you know their individual disciplines

442
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,430
people get so obsessed about it that

443
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,240
during our class time I've had to start

444
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,620
innovating ways to break people's

445
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,870
concentration so like during breaks I'll

446
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,480
write in the lights and then I'll turn

447
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,820
on increasingly obnoxious music until I

448
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,380
get to like my favorite punk music and

449
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,390
then people are like okay I don't want

450
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,440
to stare at a screen to this I'm gonna

451
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,300
get up and go walk around just so I can

452
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,620
get their brain to relax and then come

453
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,570
back stronger but I just want to put it

454
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,180
out there if you've never done it before

455
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,650
now is a great time great time as ever

456
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,060
okay so this was let's see this is basic

457
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,720
program let's close this one so now what

458
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,730
I'm going to do is let's maybe we can go

459
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:24,940
to like a little more complex scenario

460
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,010
here and

461
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,299
[Music]

462
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,970
we can take a look at bulk importing so

463
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,009
what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna do a

464
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:36,710
new project let's call this bulk import

465
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,730
and now little bit a file a batch import

466
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,999
batch bulk you get the idea so go to my

467
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:49,070
class directory let's go to exercises

468
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:54,360
re-arm and yeah let's go

469
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:01,230
so now and actually I'll right-click

470
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,759
here expand all there we go so this has

471
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,179
a big benefit because when you are doing

472
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,159
reverse engineering more real-world

473
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:13,529
scenarios not so much ones like the fun

474
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:16,470
little thing we did here but there's a

475
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,149
lot of cross referencing of files like

476
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:19,830
shared libraries things like that

477
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:25,649
and now with this tool you can within

478
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:28,350
the giro code browser you can reference

479
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,899
other files outside the one you're

480
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:33,809
currently browsing so what I mean by

481
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:37,950
that is if your binary references

482
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,889
another DLL you can just naturally

483
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:42,629
follow a link from the current binary

484
00:20:42,629 --> 00:20:44,340
into the other DLL and it'll just

485
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,799
disassemble it you compile it so the

486
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,830
same way forward engineers think about

487
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,879
programs with the whole project

488
00:20:50,879 --> 00:20:52,590
management suite this shows a great

489
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,759
level of maturity for reverse

490
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,239
engineering that I don't see in a lot of

491
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:59,730
other tools so just kind of handy to

492
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:05,129
have a bulk import ok one thing I have

493
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:08,418
to tell you and then we just open up

494
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,509
open up this is arm 3 do basic analysis

495
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:13,619
it's like another thing it's asking if

496
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:15,690
you're you know for your it's asking for

497
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,419
a password you got figured out so one of

498
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,220
the things I want to show you here is

499
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,480
just kind of like you get a little bit

500
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,399
more of a tour now that we've sort of

501
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:25,409
raced from the beginning to the end you

502
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,779
got to see the D compiled so just give

503
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:28,799
you a little tour of what you're looking

504
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,659
at here so upper left hand corner you

505
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,190
got program tree so these are like all

506
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,559
the different sections of the binary you

507
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,899
can explore by based on those down here

508
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:38,460
you have the symbol tree so you're in

509
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,690
expect imports exports

510
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,420
Phung

511
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,600
if you want to go by function and then

512
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,080
down here which is I think one of the

513
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,790
best parts of GIJoe which is its data

514
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,730
type manager so it handles data types

515
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,150
like you would expect like integer float

516
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,920
things like that but it also has like

517
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,800
these meta data types like string string

518
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,350
is I mean if you think in terms of like

519
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,330
C there's not really like a string

520
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,480
there's like an array of characters but

521
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,820
using C++ and other libraries or the

522
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,140
extension libraries you start to get

523
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,750
these more extendable methods

524
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,360
well gidran now has that with its meta

525
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,820
types and of course like most reversing

526
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,320
tools you can define your own type so my

527
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,910
colleague Evan Jenson he's got this

528
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,860
great demo which I don't have here about

529
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,250
making a PNG type and Diedre will

530
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,280
actually you can you can parse a PNG out

531
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,080
of a binary you know geezer will just

532
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,910
display it to you in line it's kind of

533
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,260
like if you're in MATLAB or something or

534
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,150
you use Jupiter notebooks you just like

535
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,530
see the graphs in line

536
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,630
deidre will display you know it'll

537
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,130
display an int display a float it'll

538
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,410
display a PNG like right in line so it's

539
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,890
coming it's kind of nice so you go

540
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,160
program trees symbol tree and then down

541
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,330
here you got console so this is like for

542
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,150
scripting so what we've covered up until

543
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:04,780
now has been mostly just manual well I

544
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,550
guess it's all manual so this is like

545
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,770
you're clicking icons you're relying on

546
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,870
the intuition of a human to go back and

547
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,030
forth and that's great except when your

548
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,310
binary has like 10,000 lines it's like

549
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,710
10 megabytes or say you have a hundred

550
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,450
binaries because you're loading in the

551
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:23,680
file system from a firmware right okay

552
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,230
so you guys are going this is where

553
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:30,070
giedrius shines to not just in it's not

554
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,450
just in as disassembler do you compiler

555
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,690
but also in its automation so up here

556
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,720
you get a green arrow display script

557
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,570
manager let's check that out and this

558
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:45,040
comes bundled with 240 scripts and it

559
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,090
covers all sorts of different

560
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:50,530
architectures in both Java and Python so

561
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,210
you may recall in the beginning when I

562
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,690
said

563
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:54,769
there were other things that would

564
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:56,539
suggest the maturity or length of

565
00:23:56,539 --> 00:23:58,399
development if you go through these

566
00:23:58,399 --> 00:24:00,529
scripts and you see how mature a lot of

567
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:03,919
these are it would suggest many person

568
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,519
years of time in development here but

569
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,940
let's take a look so we will grab the

570
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,299
simplest one possible of these scripts

571
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:18,669
and take a look at I think see example

572
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:22,840
examples it's got a Python and then

573
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,220
Sidra basics there we go it's about the

574
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,259
basic you can go now up here at the top

575
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:31,309
for the scripting manager you have this

576
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:34,100
scripting manager which is a punishment

577
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,740
if you ask me to try to work in times in

578
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,269
that write like no syntax highlighting

579
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:44,659
no nothing whatever but there's also

580
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:51,190
this here so Dedra has a very mature

581
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,649
Eclipse integration so that you can

582
00:24:54,649 --> 00:24:57,139
launch you can launch eclipse from

583
00:24:57,139 --> 00:25:00,320
Ghidorah and you can edit you can do

584
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,389
projects everything that you use eclipse

585
00:25:02,389 --> 00:25:05,470
for in your normal Java or Python

586
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,210
program development is now what you can

587
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:12,289
do for your giedrius scripts so now it's

588
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:13,610
kind of taking it out of the realm of

589
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:17,019
like interactive reversing and now

590
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:20,210
you're treating the program more like

591
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,639
it's a mathematical object to be

592
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:27,289
observed manipulated measured patched

593
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:29,570
things like that that's kind of how I

594
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,740
imagine when you transition from like

595
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,600
the intuitive back-and-forth manual

596
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,649
analysis into something that's more

597
00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:36,620
automated so let's say give your basics

598
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,350
here so this is going to do things like

599
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:43,340
let's see ask string this is added

600
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,080
comment you know things like this so

601
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,610
what I'll do is I'll go back to Ghidorah

602
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:50,360
here back to the code browser here we go

603
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,090
and I'll run this that's just with this

604
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,139
play button up here and we'll see if

605
00:25:54,139 --> 00:26:00,230
this does so this is like the hourglass

606
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,420
for G draw

607
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:08,220
please enter a value let's say 40 - 40 -

608
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:15,600
yeah okay enter a dialogue my my dial

609
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,100
okay how about that one unrecognized

610
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,220
aisle okay let's pick built-in types

611
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,150
let's go with

612
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:36,669
okay and then you'll see in the

613
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:40,690
scripting here it's a it took an hour

614
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,909
input this looks like it's a dump of

615
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:44,980
strings

616
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,519
you've chosen a datatype or whatever and

617
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:50,409
so you just see the output there and it

618
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:54,239
supports both Java and Python now

619
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:57,399
because gira is written in Java you'll

620
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:02,139
find that for the biggest changes you'd

621
00:27:02,139 --> 00:27:04,749
like made within goodra you'll want to

622
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:07,389
use Java so python is good for like

623
00:27:07,389 --> 00:27:09,639
automating routine tasks but if you want

624
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:12,850
to like extend deidre then I'd recommend

625
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:17,019
using Java and let me show you kind of

626
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:19,840
like some backup why I think that if we

627
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,879
go to right here reference libraries

628
00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:27,658
this is really

629
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,710
deidre instead of thinking of it as like

630
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,680
a 1 cor tool it's really a loose

631
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,250
framework of plugins or extensions and

632
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,100
so the disassembler is a plugin that you

633
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,990
compiler is a plug-in the browser is a

634
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,940
plugin the Grapher that everything you

635
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,960
could think of is really just another

636
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,940
job a plugin which makes it really nice

637
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,560
so you can easily extend it to do all

638
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,760
sorts of things that you know you know

639
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,870
just just different things you might

640
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,490
want to do so like you know decompiler

641
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,640
things like that so this is this this

642
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,310
also this credit here goes to Evan again

643
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,520
because this I think this is brilliant

644
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,810
so he was browsing through here and

645
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:15,890
let's see are we looking at we were

646
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:20,090
looking at file formats here and then

647
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:24,710
down here see under we see have iOS

648
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,170
Apple 8900 I remember that one I think

649
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,370
that was the processor from like the

650
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,130
first iPhone so I don't know if this has

651
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,660
been presented anywhere yet so please

652
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,430
let me know if anyone has seen this

653
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,020
before but I don't I don't think it's

654
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,330
been presented anymore but if we go down

655
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,180
here we see okay I mean this is Apple

656
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,670
8900 we have a decrypter class it's like

657
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:46,910
well what are you decrypting exactly NSA

658
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,510
or Nyssa

659
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:51,590
what are you drifting so let's take a

660
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:56,930
look so over here you know scrolling

661
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:02,560
through here we'll see iOS AES crypto

662
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:08,290
8900 constants key bytes it's like okay

663
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:15,530
what are these I guess let's can we open

664
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:21,440
declaration sorry I'm assuming in here

665
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,980
and this is kind of

666
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,630
there we go

667
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:34,840
okay so I think NSA included in its

668
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,650
release of gira and the AES key from

669
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:43,450
Apple to decrypt its 8900 firmware

670
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,330
images I guess which is like weird I

671
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,770
mean it's not a big deal in terms of

672
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,720
like confidentiality anything cuz that

673
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,610
key has been leaked for like a long time

674
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,280
it's just funny that a the US government

675
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,510
has private companies private keys in a

676
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:01,360
tool that it released so but I really

677
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,350
wish I could take credit for that one I

678
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,590
just can't or the liability really more

679
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,900
important stuff that's my colleague Evan

680
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,730
Jensen it's his name so he found that

681
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:14,679
one okay so that's that scripting let's

682
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,940
see that's modules that's Apple's AES

683
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:26,350
key I guess let's see okay okay so we

684
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,950
did bulk import let's see okay I got to

685
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:33,580
tell you about I got to tell you about

686
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:39,149
the help system so

687
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,890
I talked about the maturity of this tool

688
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:50,780
some reversing tools are they don't even

689
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,420
have like any information about how they

690
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,460
work but rather like people have to keep

691
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,890
figuring it out over and over again like

692
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,240
there's the documentation like the tools

693
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,830
evolving so quickly the doctor tation

694
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:03,260
doesn't keep up but with this tool I

695
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,540
found a strong contrast to that and that

696
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,940
the documentation is thorough it's very

697
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,880
helpful and it's available through f1 so

698
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,180
let me give you an example here so up

699
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,100
here at program tree I said here's all

700
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,380
the different segments and if I right

701
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,210
click here it's gonna offer me this

702
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:25,360
modular eyes by I mean I'll zoom in here

703
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,060
so I can modular eyes by a nuts to a

704
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,820
complexity depth or dominance you know

705
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,840
like I don't know if these things are in

706
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,990
right buttons let's see so modular eyes

707
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:39,040
by dominance and here we go so it's

708
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,390
basically laid out all of these

709
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,100
different things like in a different in

710
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,510
some order in which I might inspect the

711
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:47,420
binary now I show you that because I

712
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:51,280
want to show you like at any given time

713
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:57,170
if I don't know what dominance is what

714
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:01,990
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hit f1 and

715
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,180
what this has done is Deidre has a

716
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,060
context-sensitive help menu system you

717
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,370
can be seven layers deep in a context

718
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,740
menu or you can be in certain window and

719
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,950
you hit f1 and it doesn't bring up like

720
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,410
go see here it brings up like a thorough

721
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,830
article something that's very helpful

722
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,660
it's so helpful that when students ask

723
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,360
me how does this work how does this work

724
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,960
I said have you tried f1 yet like it's

725
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,430
kind of like been the newer version of

726
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:34,940
RTFM right more polite but like like

727
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,410
honestly it's gonna have a better answer

728
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,210
than I will have on hand anyway so read

729
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:41,060
that first then let's talk about it so I

730
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,100
found this to just be hugely helpful as

731
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,840
a teacher especially just as a person

732
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,380
learning it on my own since its public

733
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:52,870
release so the help system is just like

734
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,770
if you got to take something away it's

735
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,399
it's F

736
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:57,049
one f1 will take you pretty far on this

737
00:32:57,049 --> 00:33:00,309
one okay

738
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,720
all right let me let me cover it me we

739
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,790
pause here from all these uh different

740
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,350
demos I think it kind of hit like a lot

741
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,590
of the big stuff here and I'll leave a

742
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:16,530
lot of room for questions and okay so

743
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:17,670
let's see here

744
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:23,460
I wanted to answer I wanted to answer

745
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,010
some management questions about this

746
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,470
because a lot of the hype around Deidre

747
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,500
has been like you know here's the latest

748
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,390
firmware I didn't show you the firmware

749
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,100
off to show you the firmware so we'll

750
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,980
we'll import some firmware here but I

751
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,570
wanted to make sure I cover this - which

752
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,670
is I get a lot of questions from

753
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:45,060
managers and these are the big ones if

754
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,290
you got some more than one here some

755
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:49,500
more but the first one I'm thinking is

756
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,410
you know should my team be using this

757
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:54,420
well if you accept the definition that I

758
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,400
gave in the beginning of the talk about

759
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,260
what reversing is going from a binary to

760
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,470
answering questions it is likely that

761
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:05,220
your team could find Ghidorah useful now

762
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,170
this one kind of comes hand in hand

763
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,060
which is will attackers use this against

764
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,270
me and it's like well if the NSA doesn't

765
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,500
like you then they've been doing it

766
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,909
against you for like twenty years

767
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:16,949
but yeah attackers are gonna be using

768
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:20,370
this so you kind of avoid it at your own

769
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:23,940
peril it's like it's twenty years old

770
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,190
but how many millions of dollars of

771
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,810
funding have gone into this I can only

772
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,989
speculate and how many person years have

773
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:32,310
gone into this I mean this is a huge

774
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:35,340
body of work that no one can afford to

775
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,050
ignore you have to spend some time with

776
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,000
it see how it benefits you it may not

777
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,370
but I if your job is to reverse-engineer

778
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,760
it likely will now here's another one

779
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,850
I've been getting if it's free will this

780
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:50,790
save me money if I switch a lot of

781
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,280
people I feel that compulsion especially

782
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,020
as people are making their fiscal the

783
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,820
budget for the fiscal year I'm saying

784
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,770
I'm gonna dump all my idol licenses and

785
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:01,320
I'm gonna go go right to gear up we're

786
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,200
just gonna use Guiteau from now on which

787
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,850
that's a good healthy instinct as a

788
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,590
manager to always optimize this you can

789
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,620
go forward here's an issue though

790
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,240
[Music]

791
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,950
I haven't mentioned anything about

792
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,900
debugger yet there's no there's no

793
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,410
debugger

794
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,150
there's no dynamic analysis in deidre

795
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,270
publicly available yet I have three

796
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,950
points of information for you one I have

797
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,990
a slide from Rob Joyce which is publicly

798
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,880
available online on the right side he

799
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,650
has you know cool graphic or whatever

800
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:32,410
right says like yeah debugger coming

801
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:35,380
soon I guess the second one is there is

802
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,660
a quote from him from the register which

803
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,730
basically just quotes his slide and then

804
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:43,680
thirdly during recon earlier this year

805
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,550
can I get a show hands who was that

806
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,280
recon yeah phew you were there okay

807
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,200
recon is a great I had a good conference

808
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,590
as a it's in Montreal an audience member

809
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:57,550
asked me said excuse me NSA when will

810
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,770
the debugger be released and they said

811
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,990
they went around a little bit but they

812
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,730
finally landed on probably near the end

813
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,590
of summer so maybe I should have

814
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,450
clarified which year they're talking

815
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:07,869
about

816
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:11,080
I think they implied this summer that

817
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,140
that's on me that's on me so there's no

818
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:17,590
debugger yet and then after I have this

819
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,119
discussion with the managers the next

820
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,170
thing is up it's like well what about

821
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,790
what about that debugger plug-in I saw

822
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,340
in the debugger plugin on github can't

823
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,730
they just use that it's like well they

824
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:31,960
can it's called gdbg draw it's not meant

825
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,869
to be a full debugger it sort of like

826
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:38,590
takes the state information found by gdb

827
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:41,530
and displays it in G draw which is

828
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,750
useful but it's not a replacement for

829
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,150
debugger it's not a replacement for all

830
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,160
of the mature tooling around other

831
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,380
debuggers like gdb and Ida pros

832
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,800
integration gdb so if I were to try to

833
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,020
answer that question will this save

834
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,859
money if I switch okay if you are

835
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:01,510
dealing with reverse engineering things

836
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,340
that you'd never use dynamic analysis

837
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:07,630
with then it may save you money Ida has

838
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,430
its own ecosystem of automation and

839
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,820
scripts and plugins and things like that

840
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,030
so it may save you money if you do use

841
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,010
dynamic analysis if the things you

842
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,840
reverse engineer are within and a mature

843
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,550
enough ecosystem when which debuggers

844
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,619
exists

845
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:26,560
deidre is not a replacement don't let

846
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,190
the

847
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:30,040
the free kind of entice you past it and

848
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,480
just say I'm gonna straight up my team

849
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,790
on the I mean I train people and get

850
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,710
draw I love gay drew it's great I just

851
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,930
don't want anybody to just jump the gun

852
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,820
on that and just go right to Kira

853
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,990
because that's gonna cause some problems

854
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,400
I mean especially if your reverse

855
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,870
engineers cost as much as my reverse

856
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,970
engineers do then wasting their time by

857
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,290
making them do something statically when

858
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,030
they should be doing it dynamically that

859
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,080
will not save you time that will not

860
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,940
save you money it'll save you money on

861
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,410
some column and it'll just waste a whole

862
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,090
lot of money in another column and then

863
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,220
that effect will be whatever you choose

864
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:04,420
to spin ass but I would say you know it

865
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:08,980
most like will not save me money okay so

866
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,720
let me show you the I want to show you

867
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,330
the firmware thing and then I think I'll

868
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,100
do a summary and we'll do some questions

869
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:21,250
okay okay we close the close bro code

870
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,590
browser I'm closing that goes in the

871
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:32,700
help system exiting clips thank you okay

872
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,910
here

873
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:50,849
okay so this is the firmware from a

874
00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:55,499
Linksys eat when t500 router and I have

875
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:59,519
extracted the firmware using bin walk

876
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:02,700
and then I have imported the entire file

877
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,999
system into guitro so any file that

878
00:39:05,999 --> 00:39:07,740
references any other file I can easily

879
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,660
navigate through that system start

880
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,839
marking things up comments in put tags

881
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,430
for my colleagues about what they should

882
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,960
be looking at I mean there's about a

883
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,519
hundred features in Peter that I just

884
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:19,740
don't have time to go into there's a lot

885
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:24,950
of collaboration utilities built into

886
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,499
okay so we're in here and you know we'll

887
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:35,930
go down to let's see user s been and

888
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:42,990
there we go HTTP D so while this is

889
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,339
loading I'll just mentioned that the

890
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:45,599
collaboration utility that I referenced

891
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,400
is that in the in the beginning when I

892
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,890
say start a new project it'll say non

893
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,259
shared or shared project so guitro has

894
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:54,749
like a built in get commit like system

895
00:39:54,749 --> 00:39:57,930
in which I can check out a project make

896
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,309
some changes and it a some things and

897
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:00,359
check it back in and then you can see

898
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:02,670
the differences so that's another thing

899
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,619
that points to that maturity because if

900
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,269
you are an institution like the NSA

901
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:08,279
maybe you do have twenty people for one

902
00:40:08,279 --> 00:40:11,069
project that's very unusual to see a

903
00:40:11,069 --> 00:40:13,769
private organization have twenty people

904
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:15,779
on a reverse engineering project because

905
00:40:15,779 --> 00:40:17,069
they're reverse engineers are pretty

906
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:18,539
hard to find we're trying to make more

907
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:21,089
of them but they're hard to find so that

908
00:40:21,089 --> 00:40:23,759
uh that collaboration utility is very

909
00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:28,049
useful ok so you know through here you

910
00:40:28,049 --> 00:40:30,660
know I'll go for strings and it's a it's

911
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,319
a old old firmware so we'll look at CGI

912
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,119
which I can't member what CGI stands for

913
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:38,400
any more common great interface thanks

914
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,849
so and then we okay we'll go look at

915
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:48,349
these and cross-reference this

916
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,890
see if this D compiles into me oh you

917
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,030
know I didn't do an analysis when I

918
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:19,060
started but okay well I just wanted what

919
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,930
I really want to show you is that you

920
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:21,370
can bulk an import an entire firmware

921
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,620
system and then just start working on

922
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:29,260
together like that okay so what are some

923
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,070
of the things you want take away this

924
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,620
talk that I've talked about so far and I

925
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,820
look forward to questions you know

926
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,140
during this time and afterwards

927
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,650
let's talk about ok it's free and open

928
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,090
source that's important especially in an

929
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,470
educational environment where nobody has

930
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,750
any money it's a good disassembler it's

931
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,100
good decompiler it's extendable and

932
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,650
scriptable through java and python and

933
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:52,240
the debugger don't wait on it just don't

934
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,960
wait on it I mean I have heard rumblings

935
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,030
and rumors throughout the community for

936
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,590
a very long time about how this tool

937
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,570
some tool from the NSA was coming out

938
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:05,970
sometime and just based on that

939
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,500
anecdotal data point from my own life I

940
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,360
don't know when this debugger I think

941
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,920
somebody will write the debugger and

942
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,390
publish on github faster than they'll

943
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,430
release it and I would love for the NSA

944
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:20,890
to prove me wrong and I say ok generally

945
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:22,720
not a replacement and avoid learning it

946
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,600
you know at your own peril ok so if

947
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,560
you're interested in key draw we do

948
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,570
trainings in key draw so we are ring 0

949
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,280
in Vegas we did a guitro training there

950
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,920
we're just out in Abu Dhabi did hack in

951
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,050
a box we're gonna be at 44 Khan in

952
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,660
London first week of December doing some

953
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,280
teacher training there and then we're

954
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,300
doing teacher training out and

955
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,300
infiltrate in Miami there's my contact

956
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,750
info it's the company website you know

957
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,160
so Twitter handles if you want to ask

958
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,410
any questions and one last thing I guess

959
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:55,390
I'll mentioned for the managers or even

960
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:57,910
I guess even the reverse engineers so so

961
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:00,460
much time the valuable time or you're in

962
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,500
first engineers or exploit devs or your

963
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,210
security analyst or whatever is spent

964
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:06,100
it's like configuring your tools and

965
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,420
your environments and getting ki-moon to

966
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,860
run this one weird architecture so that

967
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,240
you can fuzz it you just need one weird

968
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,730
answer so because we've been training

969
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,350
people in Giza Ida reversing

970
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:16,930
exploitation for so long we've had to

971
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:19,210
come up with an efficient way to manage

972
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,550
all that so what we've done is we've

973
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:23,980
sort of come up with something we're

974
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,660
calling the BCI terminal

975
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,490
and we can't think of a better name so

976
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:28,839
it's kind of just stuck with that it's

977
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:29,980
kind of like Bloomberg terminal for

978
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,869
finance but this is sort of for exploit

979
00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:35,049
dev so it's collaboration ready so you

980
00:43:35,049 --> 00:43:37,390
can just pop open the Pelican case put

981
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:39,339
eight people on it synchronize in

982
00:43:39,339 --> 00:43:41,609
real-time or through a commit interface

983
00:43:41,609 --> 00:43:43,420
so if you want to hear more about that

984
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:47,109
stuff we can take time off line to talk

985
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:49,420
about how that could help your team be

986
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,470
more efficient and not spent so much

987
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:52,869
time you know figuring out key mu

988
00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:54,700
because that is a time consuming time

989
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:59,770
okay so at this point why don't I open

990
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:03,750
up for questions about Deidre

991
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:19,660
so I assume that you've used binary

992
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,940
ninja you've used Ida Pro you've used

993
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,490
possibly radar - how would you compare

994
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:27,780
getro to those three different products

995
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,660
as far as functionality ease of use and

996
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:35,470
what I can provide well what comes to

997
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:37,600
mind immediately is documentation so

998
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,910
binary ninja is just evolving so quickly

999
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,380
I think it's terrific what it's doing

1000
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,880
for the community

1001
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,480
I think the documentation the best

1002
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,950
documentation for binary ninja is like

1003
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:51,280
it's its own code I guess you know as

1004
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,320
opposed to like a mature documentation

1005
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:57,310
system as a reverse engineer I don't

1006
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:59,710
have favorites I can't afford to have

1007
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:00,880
favorites because I have to be as

1008
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,500
effective as an efficient as possible so

1009
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,020
we make sure that we have all tools at

1010
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,660
all times depending on what it calls for

1011
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,960
so sometimes it's just like programming

1012
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,130
languages kind of good way to think

1013
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:14,470
about it so if you need to like solve

1014
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,870
this problem maybe go is best or maybe

1015
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:20,560
assembly as best or you know this so I

1016
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,510
think Deidre is definitely a contender I

1017
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:24,640
don't think it's it doesn't I wouldn't

1018
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,020
write off the other tools to me it's

1019
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,590
just one more tool in my toolbox if you

1020
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:30,880
have more specific question about the

1021
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,950
how they compare I could try answering

1022
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:34,540
that - but did that answer your question

1023
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:39,810
okay okay

1024
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,180
don't know what does the developer

1025
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,740
community around geezer look like right

1026
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,170
now it's a Java based tool which is not

1027
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:54,150
typically used for most reverse

1028
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,070
engineering tasks so it seems like it's

1029
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:58,620
very specialized but is 90% of the

1030
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,270
development still being done by NSA or

1031
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:02,220
have other folks started to dip into it

1032
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,870
I certainly cannot speak to the

1033
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:05,490
percentage of development being done by

1034
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:07,590
NSA I can't speak to the community

1035
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:09,270
outside of NSA which it seems to be a

1036
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:12,060
vibrant enthusiastic community of a

1037
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,860
small group of people what I have seen

1038
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:17,070
as far as like blog posts get commits

1039
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,660
things like that

1040
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,460
I think there's like a little there's

1041
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,690
like a little bit of teasing about like

1042
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,640
oh ja but it's not the new hip language

1043
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,500
but ultimately reverse engineers don't

1044
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,490
care they don't what do they study

1045
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:28,170
assembly because it's hip it's not right

1046
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:29,400
it's because that's what you need to

1047
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,820
know to get where you want to go so I

1048
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,190
think a great place to start is github

1049
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:38,550
and I got something I got some slides

1050
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:43,200
here here we go so interoperability

1051
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,910
plugin so people are developing already

1052
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,950
like right away

1053
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:49,050
how to interface with gdb how to

1054
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:51,780
interface with r2 I mean people are

1055
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,570
enthusiastic about this although I think

1056
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:57,090
the community to expand even further

1057
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:00,530
could use some like free workshops to

1058
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:01,830
talk about

1059
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:04,770
deidre development right now it's still

1060
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:07,290
at the conferences where the prices can

1061
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,000
be prohibitive for a lot of people so I

1062
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,310
think getting some classes especially in

1063
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,560
academia since Aikido is free and

1064
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,420
open-source I think you could really

1065
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:19,080
spur a large growth for students that

1066
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,850
want to develop in Java or Python either

1067
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:25,950
one of them so doesn't answer your

1068
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:26,850
question because I don't know about the

1069
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,680
percentages but I can say it's active

1070
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,210
and people are enthusiastic just Google

1071
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:31,860
Ghidorah and everybody got a new plugin

1072
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:34,800
out every week yeah great

1073
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,180
just want to get a barometer on it that

1074
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,990
sounds good sure

1075
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:51,580
can you touch a little bit more on the

1076
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:54,010
collaboration part of getro how it works

1077
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:56,320
if people can work simultaneously or

1078
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,160
it's only serially that's a good

1079
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,270
question so it's definitely not serially

1080
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:08,200
it is a push commit pull situation it's

1081
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,690
not a real times on like Google Docs

1082
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:12,010
there actually there is a plugin for Ida

1083
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:15,190
called I darling which we've been

1084
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:17,230
working with that actually does things

1085
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:17,830
in real time

1086
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:19,960
Dedra does not do things in real time

1087
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,180
you can do things simultaneously or in

1088
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,920
parallel you can check out the project

1089
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,510
you can work on separate different

1090
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:28,240
separate functions it's a I didn't

1091
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,440
mention it is a client-server

1092
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,850
relationship so you set up a giedrius

1093
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,890
server and then people connect to it and

1094
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:34,570
then you can check out the project once

1095
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:35,620
you connect you'll see all the different

1096
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,300
projects that are listed so you can

1097
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,100
organize like your working group out of

1098
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,490
that and you know keeps track of

1099
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:44,800
checkout times pushes pulls diffs things

1100
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,710
like that it is the mark of a mature

1101
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:49,690
reversing environment to start doing

1102
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:52,480
that as opposed to like walking down the

1103
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,760
hall and looking over someone's shoulder

1104
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,870
especially if you have like really big

1105
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,520
projects and you have a team of 10-15

1106
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,470
people this is a that's a problem that I

1107
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,420
just haven't heard many managers and the

1108
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:03,820
in the private sphere really complain

1109
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,410
about because they don't have 15 reverse

1110
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,900
engineers on one project so I just can

1111
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,520
only speculate that that is a problem

1112
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,280
and I say had that had they had a long

1113
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,460
time ago and they had to solve it so

1114
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,600
clients have a relationship work in

1115
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,840
parallel push and pull commit time

1116
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:24,720
stance but not real-time okay

1117
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,200
have you ever tried using the Eclipse

1118
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,670
debugger with anything that you've

1119
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:38,029
pushed out of Deidre I have not I think

1120
00:49:38,029 --> 00:49:40,520
that Eclipse debugger does work in

1121
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,190
debugging scripts I don't know of any I

1122
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:46,730
think the full suite of capabilities

1123
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:50,720
within Eclipse works if you are

1124
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,730
operating directly on goodra or you're

1125
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:55,369
operating on giedrius scripts but that's

1126
00:49:55,369 --> 00:49:56,690
not really where I've spent a lot of my

1127
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:59,720
time with Dedra so that's the best I got

1128
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,970
for him thank you yeah you know he's a Q

1129
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:05,930
know he's a you know more questions or

1130
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:09,710
you know whatever I work one of my

1131
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:10,910
colleagues Evan Jenson so we usually

1132
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:13,220
teach everything together and so we'll

1133
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,680
be focusing on different areas so if I

1134
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,770
can answer it chances are he can so just

1135
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:20,450
