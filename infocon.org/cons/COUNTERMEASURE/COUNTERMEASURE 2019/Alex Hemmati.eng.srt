[Music]

2
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:08,010
all right well we're gonna go ahead and

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:08,760
get started

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,559
appreciate you all joining this session

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,440
today my name is Alex Ahmadi I run

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,719
federal North America team I am

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,609
stationed out of Washington DC I also

8
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:19,380
have Elaine who's my colleague sitting

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,769
actually here covering Canada and if any

10
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,359
of you are interested after our session

11
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,220
our booth is right outside and she'll be

12
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,470
happy to answer any of your questions

13
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,000
the topic that we've picked today to

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,180
talk about is around cyber range I know

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,250
the definition of cyber range varies

16
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,410
from term to term one of the things that

17
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,059
I've learned in the past 14 months from

18
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,879
being others companies that every time I

19
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,280
ask the DoD person or a civilian person

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,440
or a private person what is a range they

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,969
describe it differently so we're here to

22
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:49,440
sort of dig in a little bit more and

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,730
provide you an overview of our

24
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,870
definition of what range is um that's a

25
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,579
known fact I was gonna play around and

26
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:57,629
say you know what I got some news for

27
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,370
you guys and nobody understands but you

28
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,870
know eventually your organization's are

29
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,629
going to get hacked the trend has

30
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,369
certainly changed in the past ten years

31
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,340
where ten years ago I met with a sizzle

32
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,360
of Northeast City very prominent North

33
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,689
East City and I asked him hey uh you

34
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,369
know let's assume that you get popped

35
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,310
what happens then they I looked at me

36
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,509
and he said listen if there's stuff

37
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,729
crawling on my network that I don't know

38
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,180
about I don't want to know about it that

39
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,810
was the trend ten years ago until guess

40
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,470
who got hacked target gets hacked and

41
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,479
all of a sudden the target sizzle was

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,369
literally the first c-level executive

43
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,860
from a security standpoint that was

44
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,840
fired and then everybody started taking

45
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,329
security a lot more seriously and being

46
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:47,430
vocal about hey you know what maybe we

47
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,290
should start looking at how to protect

48
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,570
ourselves there are three things that I

49
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,030
would say is a key takeaway as part of

50
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,939
this conversation it's people processes

51
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,430
and technologies and we'll walk we will

52
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,740
walk you guys through all of that

53
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,380
as I mentioned security teams will go

54
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,149
through this process now you may have

55
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:08,399
measures in place where you'll invite a

56
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,800
company that I worked for in the past

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,390
like Mandy and a fire right to come in

58
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,030
and clean up

59
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,370
or you or do an assessment for you or

60
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,200
you have your own security teams that

61
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,580
will be able to sort of take care of

62
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,440
this scenario for you some of the

63
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,510
compromises that are more notable to

64
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,420
happen in the past couple of years

65
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,590
interesting enough one of my backgrounds

66
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,290
is with a company called HBGary anybody

67
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,260
heard of that company name nobody huh

68
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,750
there we go

69
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,580
HBGary was the first company back in

70
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,420
2011 that got popped by anonymous

71
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,520
that was my first day so go figure that

72
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,170
out my email didn't work the first day I

73
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,709
thought I was fired already

74
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,940
so the question becomes you know are you

75
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,880
ready you know is your organization

76
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,090
prepared when an attack does take place

77
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,340
are your people prepared is the

78
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,980
technology in place and are the

79
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,530
processes in place where all the way

80
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,660
from your siz oh he added leadership

81
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,370
position he understands exactly what

82
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,170
needs to go down to get triggered down

83
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,690
so he can get those reports put it

84
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,250
together and go back to the stakeholders

85
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,750
and provide an overview of the

86
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,650
compromise I was asking folks if anybody

87
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,030
remembers who this guy is but this guy

88
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,959
looks like Sherman from American Pie but

89
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,190
Thank You Lane for putting that in there

90
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,829
that's very entertaining so you know

91
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,540
when it becomes - when we start talking

92
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,130
about some of the challenges that take

93
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,079
place as far as training is concerned

94
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,760
I've been doing endpoint for about ten

95
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,560
years and when I started looking at

96
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,000
cyber range worlds of interesting things

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,040
that I notice is that in traditional

98
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,950
training there's a lack of exercise you

99
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,870
know what we all learn by doing I don't

100
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,670
learn by reading I'll read something and

101
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,140
I'll walk away I'll forget about it if

102
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,459
I'm not compared

103
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:50,170
practicing it or if I'm not going

104
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,780
through it the goal is essentially by

105
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,120
going through real-life exercises and

106
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,430
getting an understanding of how to

107
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,440
respond to different types of incidents

108
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,940
whether it's blue team with its red team

109
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,079
where there's capture the flag whether

110
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:04,060
you're military or private it really

111
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,690
doesn't matter can anybody tell me what

112
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:12,340
that is there you go why did I put it up

113
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,549
there

114
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:22,160
out loud loud so I put that on there for

115
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,820
a reason

116
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,180
the Air Force the United States Air

117
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,100
Force and and I apologize since I'm from

118
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,480
the states that's who I can talk to if

119
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,950
you have more questions Elaine will be

120
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,840
happy to talk about the Canadian Air

121
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,120
Force the United States Air Force has a

122
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,960
very robust simulation program and they

123
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,210
put their Airmen to these type of

124
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,340
programs because they want them to

125
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,460
experience real scenarios in a real

126
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,610
cockpit getting the same effect that

127
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,860
they're beginning otherwise in a in a

128
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:57,550
combat as an example so the concept of

129
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,830
how we you don't have our Airmen go

130
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,570
through these fly simulations we've

131
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,400
taken that concept when we've applied it

132
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,830
to our cyber range platform and we'll

133
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,150
talk about that in a little bit more I'm

134
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,979
trying not to get into the product

135
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:12,440
conversations as much but I will sort of

136
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,780
provide you an overview of off the

137
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,550
platform how it's settled from

138
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,620
architecture standpoint if you guys have

139
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,940
any other questions like I said the

140
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,169
Elaine is outside and she'd be happy to

141
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:23,180
answer any of those questions at the end

142
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,010
of the day this is for the Knology that

143
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,380
we all can relate to you practice by

144
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,520
doing you learn as you're doing not by

145
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,990
reading and putting a book on the

146
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,250
shelves and we'll talk about that a

147
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,030
little bit more some of the industries

148
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,000
you know notable websites you know media

149
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,250
have started talking about you know how

150
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,810
software is just not enough every

151
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,150
organization thinks that by buying more

152
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,280
software buy more security prep products

153
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,840
putting layers over layers over layers

154
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,620
that they'd be able to easily

155
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,550
protect themselves protect their

156
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,500
environments the end of the day the bad

157
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,360
guy does attacking you it's not costing

158
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,680
him anything to sit there and come up

159
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,270
with a new code whereas you spending

160
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,450
millions of dollars and new technologies

161
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,930
closing the gap on the education more in

162
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,150
more organizations that we're talking to

163
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,680
are beginning to realize that hey you

164
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,570
know what some of the challenges that I

165
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,840
have I have training budgets that I got

166
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,970
to spend on so I'm spending them on you

167
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,710
know getting my guys trained getting

168
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,210
certificates getting on just the

169
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,400
understanding you know yeah how to run a

170
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,710
sock how to respond to a sock but at the

171
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,740
end of the day a lot

172
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,810
the folks that are going through these

173
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,240
trainings they're not coming out as

174
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,069
being a practitioner that's the goal

175
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:36,930
here right is basically making sure that

176
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,520
your team after these exercises

177
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,610
understand these processes and and we'll

178
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,590
talk about that a little bit more um

179
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,819
some of the other notes that was

180
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,810
mentioned I want to get to the how we

181
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,770
perceive cyber range to be how we

182
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,970
perceive cyber a range is really

183
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,349
interesting there were the way that we

184
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:58,789
actually designed this was based on

185
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:01,680
military request to create a

186
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,210
hyper-realistic environment where they

187
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,460
can train their their their cyber

188
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,080
warriors I'm basically get individuals

189
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,580
that not necessarily have any type of a

190
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,289
cyber training and in a matter of months

191
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:12,270
I'm based on a certain curriculum get

192
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,970
them up and running based on those those

193
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,460
exercises and scenarios so how we're

194
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,620
applying to this training is through a

195
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,840
real-world Network and what we say by

196
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,199
that is that we've designed a mimic of a

197
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,199
real environment virtualized with real

198
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,569
components now we're not a product

199
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:33,960
centric platform we're process centric

200
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,789
meaning that regardless of the product

201
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,409
that you're using you got to be able to

202
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:40,349
understand how to detect respond and

203
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:42,659
prevent and as part of that exercise

204
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,190
what we've done is that we've integrated

205
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,930
with a lot of technologies that you see

206
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,570
here today and we're applying those

207
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,219
technologies as part of our range

208
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,620
exercise so as as an example you know

209
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,810
with sim we have an integration with our

210
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,550
side we have integration with Splunk we

211
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,520
key radar the checkpoint from a firewall

212
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,590
perspective or Palo Alto because we want

213
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,759
to make sure that individuals that are

214
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,930
going through these type of trainings

215
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,580
they understand how to use these

216
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,440
products in order to respond effectively

217
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:12,330
there's cyber inch platforms so that's

218
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,250
basically what our platform looks like

219
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,139
it's a virtualized Network we have

220
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,960
traffic generators that are essentially

221
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,930
creating the traffic coming into that

222
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,330
environment you have an attack generator

223
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,099
now the attack generator is really

224
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,889
interesting because we are deploying

225
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:31,860
actual malware into that environment we

226
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,130
are not mimicking a behavior of a

227
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,289
malware or an iteration of a malware

228
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:38,969
this is an actual malware that gets

229
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:40,620
deployed in to add to that virtual

230
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,450
environment

231
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,640
I know one of the questions that may be

232
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,150
brought up later on is okay well what if

233
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,950
the mal will gets out this entire

234
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,080
platform is actually air gapped and not

235
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,780
connected to the Internet you guys can

236
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,310
decide to have anymore access to it you

237
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,990
guys can sit in the same room and do car

238
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,140
cyber exercises some of the training and

239
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,460
the scenarios that we have we have about

240
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,980
30 scenarios give and take that are

241
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,540
available in this range you know all the

242
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,870
way from a entry level sock training to

243
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,880
ICS training to an advanced sock

244
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,950
training to even tuned to doing some Red

245
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,320
Team exercises and their industrial

246
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,900
control systems as mentioned and we'll

247
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,550
talk about that a little bit more in

248
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,240
more details the product also allows you

249
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,040
to do to advance customizations I see a

250
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,630
couple of faces that drop by the boot

251
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,250
and they were asking about customization

252
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,230
so the product actually allows you to be

253
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,620
able to create your own networks and

254
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,090
create your own scenarios and what's

255
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,570
interesting about this is that we have

256
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,250
30 scenarios that are out of the box but

257
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,480
if you have your own iteration of a

258
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,130
malware or if you want to create your

259
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,750
own scenario we actually give you the

260
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,490
tool to be able to do that and upload it

261
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,890
into the platform now with regards to

262
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,870
the network same goes about that we have

263
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,730
a number of networks that are already

264
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,780
pre-built

265
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,270
into the environment that you can

266
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,930
leverage within the range or you can go

267
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,420
ahead and create a network completely

268
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,610
from scratch we do have some customers

269
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,410
that have actually taken their

270
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,780
production network and have mimicked it

271
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,640
in a smaller scale into the range

272
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,740
because they're looking to not only use

273
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,440
it for cyber exercises but they're also

274
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,970
using it for pen testing they're using

275
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,380
it for pocs they're using it for

276
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,330
employee skill validation there are so

277
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,570
many other variances of how this type of

278
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,790
technology can get applied into an

279
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,740
environment not necessarily just

280
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:33,710
conducting traditional cyber training as

281
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,050
you can see on the pictures the Israeli

282
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,520
Defense Forces are actually the ones

283
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,380
that originally this product was

284
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,730
designed for and they have multiple

285
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,340
cyber range facilities in Israel that

286
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,660
they're going through and actually are

287
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,940
inviting a lot of other foreign

288
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,320
militaries to come and go through these

289
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,660
type of exercises we talked about soft

290
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,950
skills one of the

291
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,960
things that happens I don't I don't know

292
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,120
a fee obviously I'm not gonna ask these

293
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,260
questions because I don't expect you

294
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,660
guys to raise your hand but I'm guessing

295
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,920
most of you guys have gone through some

296
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,390
type of an incident in the past so you

297
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,400
feel that pressure you go through that

298
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,740
feeling of you know just being so

299
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,600
vulnerable not knowing exactly what we

300
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,630
need to do next

301
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,830
unfortunately or fortunately I've had

302
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:19,340
the pleasure or miss pleasure of being

303
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,140
part of those organizations that were

304
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,720
invited to come in and do the incident

305
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,310
response when those organizations were

306
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,350
popped and one of the first things that

307
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,830
that I learned in those processes is you

308
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,370
know what

309
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,930
doesn't matter what technology you have

310
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,880
doesn't matter what process and doesn't

311
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,550
matter what type of skill sets or people

312
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,590
you have at the end of the day those

313
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,750
soft skills is when becomes handy the

314
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,210
communications between teams when you're

315
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,860
under pressure understanding what type

316
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,690
of data you need to deliver what's up

317
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,190
our responsibilities you need to adapt

318
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,170
as part of this and I'll give you guys

319
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,960
the good bad and ugly I first engagement

320
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,850
we did with an organization in us these

321
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,020
guys had the technology they had

322
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,820
obviously a good funding so they had the

323
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,920
technology place they had the right

324
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,630
people they had the right skill sets

325
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,190
understanding how to leverage these

326
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,570
technologies and how to go about

327
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,060
conducting the investigations and they

328
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,160
had processes in place they were able to

329
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,980
contain the malware in less than 48

330
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,410
hours and it was actually a pretty

331
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,910
sophisticated malware that was geared

332
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,480
toward that it's specific agency another

333
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,130
example of bad is really not

334
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,140
understanding the processors having the

335
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,780
skillsets not having the skillsets

336
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,730
having the technology and having the

337
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,050
process but not having the right people

338
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,180
understand how to apply those processes

339
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,610
or technologies one end up happening and

340
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,160
I kid you guys not because this is I was

341
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,760
there the malware that got deployed in

342
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,290
that environment was so sophisticated

343
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,330
that every time he was changing patterns

344
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,980
you could actually see that analyst

345
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,720
names at the end of that signature the

346
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,180
analysts that were sitting in that sock

347
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,310
that's how bad these guys were owned but

348
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,500
at the same time there was really not a

349
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,720
processing plate nobody knew exactly how

350
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,520
to leverage these type of transitions

351
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,240
and the last piece

352
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,010
around a simple malware that was a

353
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,410
drive-by and he got made into such a big

354
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,029
deal that half of me knows what the

355
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:16,890
hardware got thrown out for no reason

356
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,260
point being there's gonna be financial

357
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,730
damage to private organizations there's

358
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,380
gonna be reputation damage to public

359
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,140
organizations so we all need to be

360
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:31,440
prepare for that talk about our ROI it's

361
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,180
pretty self-explanatory as to what it's

362
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,790
written here you know getting ready

363
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,260
mentally whether you're doing a team

364
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,850
exercise where the heat or whether

365
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,920
you're doing an individual exercise as a

366
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,260
team exercise the way that we operate

367
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,410
each scenario is as if you are actually

368
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,630
managing a production environment it's

369
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,640
by half taking up responsibilities as

370
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,860
part of the sock and communicating with

371
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,390
each other as you're solving this

372
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,120
problem now this problem is broken down

373
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,860
within each scenario from a detection

374
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,110
response and prevention which is based

375
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,670
on this framework and we've also

376
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,740
recently aligned it based on mitre

377
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,300
attack matrix based on some of the

378
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,120
customers that we've had so your folks

379
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,160
will understand exactly what each step

380
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,020
that needs to take place within the

381
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,060
detection phase within the response

382
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,829
phase and the remediation phase multiple

383
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:22,860
use cases as I mentioned a couple of

384
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,589
minutes ago organizations are using this

385
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:28,079
for different means it's just not for a

386
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,029
traditional range they're using it as

387
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:32,550
part of the Blue Team Red Team CTF

388
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,370
capture the flag exercise some

389
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,170
organizations are using it actually and

390
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,670
these are this actually one of the

391
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,140
system integrators in the u.s. that

392
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,579
really brought this to my attention is

393
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,320
that yesterday we have about 400 guys

394
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,180
that we hire every year as far as

395
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,670
security teams and they say they say the

396
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,829
right things absolutely they say the

397
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:51,180
right things we hire them put them on a

398
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,010
contract three months later we get a

399
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,860
call from our customer saying that this

400
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,120
guy doesn't really know what he's

401
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,140
talking about and he understands the

402
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,399
concept just doesn't know how to run the

403
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,430
system so one of the tool how they're

404
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,540
looking to use these technologies

405
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,190
actually as part of the interview

406
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,870
process by throwing them in the middle

407
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,079
the exercise and see exactly if they can

408
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,120
walk the walk

409
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,790
we do provide certifications as part of

410
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,980
as part of the exercise so that's

411
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,180
certainly something that's obviously

412
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,860
important to a lot of security folks as

413
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,760
getting trained and they're putting

414
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,220
hours in there and he allows you to be

415
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,930
able to get a little bit granular in

416
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,640
more sophisticated environments and

417
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,410
simulate your own network and your own

418
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,930
tools and be able to exercise your own

419
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:41,010
playbooks Australian government some of

420
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,560
the put some of the press release that

421
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,030
was out there because they Australian

422
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,090
D&E they actually have deployed this all

423
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,340
across the board and they are using it

424
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,320
very religiously and they've actually

425
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,200
incorporated into the tactics as part of

426
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,750
their cybersecurity exercises and we can

427
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,010
basically share this presentation with

428
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,920
you guys if you wish so some of the

429
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,470
customers that we're running in the

430
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,940
environment worldwide

431
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,900
surprisingly we have a great adaptation

432
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,510
in the United States from universities

433
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,860
because they're actually looking at

434
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,520
implementing the cyber range into their

435
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,590
curriculum and having students that are

436
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,350
becoming graduates of the cyber security

437
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,860
degree program go through a phase of

438
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,050
understanding how to respond in

439
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,250
different scenarios and really at the

440
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,810
end of the day become a practitioner and

441
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:31,770
I think that's the biggest challenge

442
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,530
right now the industry is missing Talent

443
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,380
there's a lot of jobs out there and a

444
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,520
lot of people are coming out with a

445
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,020
cyber security degree but at the end of

446
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,190
the day there are not that many people

447
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,190
that are qualified to do that specific

448
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,440
job or command and he's needed and I

449
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,980
think from our perspective having to go

450
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,710
through some exercises with cyber vet

451
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,030
cyber range platform

452
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,420
it would leverage them to become more

453
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,050
qualified for those type of positions a

454
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,630
demo we were actually planning to do a

455
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,599
demo but I would prefer that we leave it

456
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,280
outside and we're gonna do a demo I

457
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,319
don't want the folks over at the

458
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,440
conference yell at me so with that being

459
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,440
said I thank you so much for your time I

460
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,940
take any questions if you guys if

461
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,960
there's anything that you want to talk

462
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,110
about

463
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:35,639
