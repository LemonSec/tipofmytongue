[Music]

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,980
so in today's topic I entitled shared

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,469
responsibility is not shared risk and I

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,199
did that specifically because I do a lot

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,000
of work in governance risk and

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,789
compliance and I see a lot of

7
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,420
organizations that they turn to like a

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,480
provider or an IT organization or they

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,220
code you know essentially across the

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,369
wall and they ask questions about risk

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,280
and the the people that are on the

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,469
answering side of that try to answer

13
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,059
those questions and they probably

14
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,550
shouldn't and so what I'm here today to

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,760
talk about is that managing risk in an

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,860
environment where we've got multiple

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,440
providers and so on so what I'm talking

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,760
about cloud of course so let's get into

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,090
that so Who am I so as as Chris

20
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,629
indicated I do nothing but consulting in

21
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:03,270
governance risk and compliance iceberg

22
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,099
networks as a company does software

23
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,170
implementation with a couple of the

24
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,200
leading GRC products but we don't have a

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,750
product on our own so we I think it

26
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,820
makes us very well-suited to provide

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,619
advice around how to do this sort of

28
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:17,670
thing

29
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,409
iceberg didn't start off to do

30
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,450
governance risk and compliance we

31
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,009
actually started off to do risk

32
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,720
management consulting that was our

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,430
raison d'être

34
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,820
but around 2008 timeframe I was doing

35
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,119
work in compliance and I was working

36
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,009
with gigantic spreadsheets full of

37
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,829
controls and inventories of things and

38
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:39,659
dealing with them or asked that as far

39
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,009
as I'm aware a lot of people are still

40
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,890
dealing with that sort of thing and at

41
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,930
that point we got introduced to

42
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,060
governance risk and compliance software

43
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,200
and saw the light so to speak and around

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,060
that time we decided to shift the

45
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,829
strategic focus of the company to be

46
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,020
doing nothing but governance risk and

47
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,280
compliance and we've been doing that for

48
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,570
about 10 years now so as I say I think

49
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,009
we've got a lot of history under the

50
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,008
belt now and have learned a lot of

51
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,959
lessons I was on a course about a month

52
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:13,890
ago

53
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,170
and the instructor of the course in a

54
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,000
little kind of classroom introduction

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,550
thing said if you had a superpower what

56
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,170
would your superpower be do you want to

57
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,000
be able to fly or do you want to turn

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,590
invisible or shape change or something

59
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,569
like that and when it came around to me

60
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:30,300
I said I don't want a superpower I've

61
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,940
got a superpower and so I told him that

62
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,709
my superpower was that I can peel labels

63
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,920
off of things my wife thinks it's genius

64
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,180
but I don't think I'm ever gonna make

65
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,840
the x-men so so as I think I talked a

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,459
little bit about this but what am I here

67
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,230
to talk about so I want to go through

68
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,970
what does the shared responsibility

69
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,630
model actually look like there's been a

70
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,519
number of different kind of publications

71
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,200
on the topic and I want to go through a

72
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,300
couple of the the models that have been

73
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,170
presented there's a huge I think barrier

74
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,209
in communications around the words that

75
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,250
we use and so I want to do a little bit

76
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,900
of discussion around you know how we

77
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,180
might do better communication around the

78
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,660
topic of risk and then you know how do

79
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,360
we actually manage the whole assurance

80
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,610
posture and so you know in the

81
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,640
government that tends to be si na in

82
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,829
private industry there may be topics

83
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,450
that are similar but there's always the

84
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,860
concept of I want to make sure I'm

85
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,290
secure how do I do that

86
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,120
so there's some challenges in doing that

87
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
and then the model for managing the

88
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,870
complexity of it so I think this goes

89
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,870
into the I have a dream I'm a bit of a

90
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,180
GRC geek so I tend to think about how

91
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,130
GRC might might help the world but I

92
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,510
know what's going on right now in the

93
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,610
world is digital transformation so my

94
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,970
digital transformation dream is I want

95
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,920
to be able to send my autonomous car out

96
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,500
to go pick up my renewed passport and

97
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,180
fishing license and bring them home so I

98
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,840
can go off and do my things that might

99
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,700
be a little bit dumb because if we

100
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,440
really were fully transformed you

101
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,730
wouldn't need a paper passport or a

102
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,100
fishing license so what the heck but

103
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,779
that's probably why I shouldn't be

104
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,769
managing your digital transformation

105
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,599
portfolio I should be helping you secure

106
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:27,450
it so

107
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,580
digital transformation does however mean

108
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,490
that people need to move faster they

109
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,350
need to adopt new technologies new

110
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,620
services new models for delivery and so

111
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,900
in order to accomplish all of that and

112
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,900
also manage risk at the same time really

113
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,570
requires organizations move quickly in

114
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,830
certain areas and I believe that GRC

115
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,990
governance risk and compliance really

116
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,240
needs to undergo that same digital

117
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,480
transformation as the core services that

118
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,000
an organization is delivering I think if

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,190
you have digital transformation of your

120
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,590
services without figuring out how to

121
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,770
manage risk faster and better you will

122
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,220
be in for a world of hurt so I I want to

123
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,320
make the pitch for why there's better

124
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,360
ways to do some of the security

125
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,880
activities that people are doing today

126
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,690
so let's get into the whole concept of

127
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,140
the shared responsibility has anybody

128
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,030
I'm assuming everybody has seen these

129
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,070
kind of models that they they've you

130
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,990
know done cloud implementations and that

131
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,550
sort of things you've got a bit of a

132
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,930
idea of what it looks like

133
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,940
so I'm going to start with a model that

134
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,610
was it's actually this is a not an exact

135
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,680
scrape but it's up on the Government of

136
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,710
Canada website for the protected B

137
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:53,460
medium medium cloud profile and so this

138
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,230
is a model that's showing there are

139
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,190
different mechanisms for absorbing

140
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,320
services and so there's the

141
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,970
infrastructure as a service platform

142
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,240
software as a service and everybody's

143
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,730
got models that actually have very you

144
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,480
know similar shapes to this where as you

145
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,690
move up the stack you tend to push

146
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,540
responsibility for things down to the

147
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,040
the organization that's doing the

148
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,340
service delivery and so this is it's

149
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,140
building up a bit of a picture of it

150
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,700
starts with a physical infrastructure

151
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,360
moves into the you know to the hardware

152
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,000
software that's delivering it at some

153
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,560
point they all talk about an abstraction

154
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,990
layer and the abstraction layer becomes

155
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,610
I think really important because this is

156
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,320
where the the client really first

157
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,070
interacts with

158
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,050
organization and there's this really

159
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,390
strong hope that everything they're

160
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,210
interacting with below the abstraction

161
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,980
layer that they really don't need to

162
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,530
worry about terribly much I think

163
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,300
there's you know some of that is kind of

164
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,090
true but some of it also is not true and

165
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,990
I think there's a the activities that

166
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,090
you would normally do around securing an

167
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,210
infrastructure really don't go away you

168
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,010
don't lose the responsibility for

169
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,470
ensuring that things are in place what

170
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,330
you do though is have the ability to

171
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,920
ensure they're in place through a

172
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,770
contract mechanism rather than ensuring

173
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,120
they're in place through actual

174
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,430
expenditures on security technologies

175
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,150
and resources and so on but the the idea

176
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,100
is that you have you know certain

177
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,930
technology elements that you're

178
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,120
responsible for technology elements that

179
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,730
the provider is responsible for and you

180
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,740
now as I say kind of hope crossed your

181
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,750
fingers that across that contract

182
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,820
relationship that you've thought of

183
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,660
everything so I want to go to a model of

184
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,730
this I think a little bit more detailed

185
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:51,150
you have a question it's actually on the

186
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,580
Canada CA site I've got a link later on

187
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,320
in the presentation I can show you you

188
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,110
know where it came from as I say I took

189
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,420
slight liberties with the the diagram

190
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,940
but and I'm gonna take even more

191
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,890
liberties with this okay so this is

192
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,070
Amazon's

193
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,010
picture of shared responsibility so this

194
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,780
if you haven't seen it this came from

195
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,610
the AWS some of the information site for

196
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,520
the Amazon Web Services and this is how

197
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,360
Amazon sees their services and your

198
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,640
consumption of their services so they've

199
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,560
got a pretty strong model here where we

200
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,930
have Amazon is they could say they're

201
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,450
responsible for security of the cloud

202
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,150
and so they you know kind of detail out

203
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,370
what they mean by cloud and and all that

204
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,370
so that's great then we go up to the

205
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,950
customer side and Amazon says the

206
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,350
customer is responsible for security in

207
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,230
the cloud and that's kind of an

208
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,240
interesting statement but if you look at

209
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,370
the the different layers that they've

210
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,200
put in there it all sort of makes sense

211
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,390
so it starts at the top with the actual

212
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,520
data so this is obviously customer data

213
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,770
they own it they're responsible for it

214
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,270
they're responsible for it safekeeping

215
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,100
so that's great

216
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,900
and then we get into Identity and Access

217
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,850
Management ah yeah another one that

218
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,620
clearly the client is typically going to

219
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,850
be responsible for that

220
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,070
Amazon may provide technologies that

221
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,470
help with that but the actual processes

222
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,589
are customer focused and then we get

223
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:23,080
into the you know the different layers

224
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,200
and down into the software and compute

225
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,710
storage and so on I owed a little

226
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,560
sidebar on database does anybody other

227
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,080
than me see database as just a storage

228
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:40,660
abstraction okay so it's so I don't know

229
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,339
why it gets called out specifically I

230
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:44,370
think because it typically has a lot of

231
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,680
granular access control capabilities now

232
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,210
so it's treated a little bit differently

233
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,460
but anyway that's as I say a bit of a

234
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,720
sidebar there so I want to get into now

235
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,240
what does shared responsibilities mean

236
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,910
and from my perspective I can equate

237
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,820
responsibilities with controls so if you

238
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,920
think about you know back to my topic is

239
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,660
managing risk

240
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,270
most people don't manage risk they

241
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:17,080
manage controls and so you want well if

242
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,970
you've got responsibility for managing

243
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,470
risk you want to make sure that you've

244
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,720
told people underneath you what the

245
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,459
controls are that you're expecting to be

246
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:26,589
in place so it's already a you know sort

247
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:29,589
of a shift in language what I've done

248
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:32,680
here is I've taken controls from the IT

249
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,430
SG 33 or nist SP at under - 53 depending

250
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,620
on which one you want to refer to taking

251
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,360
the control families and tried to slot

252
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,650
them into the shared responsibility

253
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:46,779
model the first bottom layer here where

254
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:51,750
I've got oh I just blanked out here

255
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,089
technology failure all right let's hope

256
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:57,820
that doesn't happen again at the bottom

257
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,180
layer Amazon themselves says controls

258
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,660
that you can inherit from us our

259
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,640
physical security controls so they're

260
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,110
very explicit these are the

261
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,000
only controls where you can fully

262
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,029
inherit them that's kind of interesting

263
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:14,700
they don't actually make very many

264
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,110
assertions about the security then of

265
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,140
the product above that but I think

266
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,570
there's a lot of reason for that and the

267
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,820
next few controls the system integrity

268
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,620
aware innocent training and that sort of

269
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,029
thing those are actually control

270
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:31,029
families that Amazon themselves calls

271
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:33,910
out and says that these are shared

272
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,570
controls and I kind of like that picture

273
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,880
because the they actually don't call out

274
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,959
system integrity they call out patching

275
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,399
they say patching is a shared

276
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,250
responsibility and yeah because actually

277
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,829
if you buy you know ec2 from Amazon

278
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:53,529
you're responsible for managing the the

279
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:56,529
updates on the software so that's kind

280
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:58,180
of cool but they do provide tools for

281
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,459
doing that sort of thing so those are

282
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:02,860
nice shared responsibilities I was kind

283
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,029
of questioning awareness and training

284
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:06,420
but what they say about that is that

285
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,769
they train their own people and they

286
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,260
train their people in security and so ok

287
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,370
I'll buy that

288
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,500
so then what I did is I said well where

289
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,680
did the controls above that layer fit

290
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,449
and so I started slotting in this is me

291
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:21,070
taking like enormous liberties with the

292
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,350
families of controls and hoping people

293
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,959
forgive me for that but I started

294
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:27,970
slotting in the different control

295
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,670
families as to where the customer may be

296
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,699
responsible for them and you know like

297
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:35,529
it or not I kind of I placed them into

298
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:38,199
the different layers and one of the

299
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:40,570
things that the astute will notice is

300
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,670
that there are some control families

301
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,329
missing and so this is really the crux

302
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:51,160
of my argument is that nowhere in here

303
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,680
does anybody ever say anything about

304
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,010
risk what they're talking about is

305
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,760
security and controls and

306
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,600
vulnerabilities and so they're talking

307
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,980
about all of the elements of risk

308
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,510
they're not talking about risk itself

309
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,820
and so I thought aha here's an

310
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,640
opportunity to expand the model a little

311
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,290
bit and so that's what I'm doing and so

312
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,180
I said well where does risk really lie

313
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,230
in that model and risk should lie at the

314
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,520
products and services

315
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,800
lair so if I'm doing digital

316
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,120
transformation what I'm really trying to

317
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,400
do is offer a new service or an existing

318
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,400
to transform an existing service into a

319
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,880
digital version of that and so the where

320
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,400
the service lies in the Amazon model is

321
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,560
off the top it doesn't even exist

322
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,800
and so that service I modeled it out as

323
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,420
products and service at the top layer

324
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,930
and then we have our staff that operated

325
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,300
and so this is the the first line of

326
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,190
defense or the the you know the

327
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,380
operational staff that are providing the

328
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,630
set of the people behind the man in the

329
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,980
machine the people that are behind the

330
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,050
service and what they're doing is

331
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,460
they're delivering some sort of business

332
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,640
service and so this is actually if you

333
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,640
ever look at GRC tools and how they

334
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,760
model out a infrastructure they tend to

335
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,000
treat the like CMDB with all of the IT

336
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,650
infrastructure as just kind of honest

337
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,470
the CMDB yet you know a super important

338
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,840
topic from a security perspective but

339
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,000
where GRC really wants to get to is the

340
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,310
business context and the business

341
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,370
context is found at the business process

342
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,410
and that business service that you're

343
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,920
delivering and so we're you know so you

344
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,540
ask the question around even things like

345
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,210
you know SAA when you know somebody is

346
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,670
asked to authorize something going into

347
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,890
service they're typically authorizing

348
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,800
not just some information system but

349
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,390
they're typically authorizing a whole

350
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,650
service all at once yes

351
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,710
there's an entire layer of the platform

352
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,060
marriage you don't seem to have much

353
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,950
visibility to assurance or reporting ten

354
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,220
years ago when you see a result of the

355
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,180
emergence of you know wow you should be

356
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,490
forming cloud questions okay but there

357
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,820
is an impact there's an incident at back

358
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,220
yellow there what's the method of

359
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,780
disclosure was the responsibility

360
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,120
that you're like absolutely feeding into

361
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,090
my dream world and that's a and so I

362
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,740
think the question is around you know

363
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,260
how do we get visibility across that

364
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,480
contractual boundary into all of the

365
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,450
controls that are underneath and I know

366
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,930
it's actually a very challenging problem

367
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,790
and you know I'd like to present what I

368
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,000
think solution could be but I will also

369
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,340
declare that nobody has ever implemented

370
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,920
it so I think what you're talking about

371
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,750
is okay we've got this

372
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,250
you know I'll call it a bit of a dream

373
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,010
world about how it may all fit together

374
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,170
but and there are the tools potentially

375
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,180
available but it's simply not been

376
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,880
implemented and I'll get into some of

377
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,440
the reasons why it perhaps hasn't been

378
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,820
implemented but let's good I'll try to

379
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,500
keep that in mind as I get into the next

380
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,490
part of this if I go back to this model

381
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,980
though and say okay this is this is now

382
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,600
really good I've been able to add some

383
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,450
additional control families to my to my

384
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,050
model means that I've now got a much

385
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,580
more complete picture and I've actually

386
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,010
found somebody who is responsible for

387
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,770
risk and so now I've got the products

388
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,690
and services owner and this in you know

389
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,790
IT vernacular is typically called the

390
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,100
business I use the air quotes because

391
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,990
it's a you know very generic term but

392
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:02,530
very common and so the business is

393
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,359
responsible for managing risk they're

394
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,980
responsible for managing risk of their

395
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,770
products and service they're not really

396
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,040
all that concerned about the details

397
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,800
underneath that they really just want to

398
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,209
be able to ask the question you know

399
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:18,220
what is you know what is my risk what is

400
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,800
the exposure I'm accepting when I decide

401
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,579
to authorize this I do want to point out

402
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:27,550
that again for the astute there are

403
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,270
still some control families missing and

404
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:33,580
so that's where I want to do one more

405
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,870
build on this

406
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,970
and say well in order to really get to a

407
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,010
complete picture I need to go even

408
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,820
higher higher still there is a control

409
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,080
family the PM family that is not

410
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,720
typically always included in the way

411
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,690
people do their kind of control library

412
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,510
management and the PM family is program

413
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,740
management and it's all about the

414
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,220
security program so what I've done as I

415
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,870
said well in order to get to a model

416
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,000
where I can say all of my controls are

417
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,870
now modeled out I've got a home for them

418
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,210
what I needed to do is add the really

419
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,770
very top layer where I get into

420
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,080
corporate governance and so now what

421
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,110
I've done is I've gone from you know

422
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,990
kind of security and vulnerability up

423
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,150
into risk but I'm still at the

424
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,330
operational risk thread but I've traced

425
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,100
it now all the way up into enterprise

426
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,200
risk so now I've got people that are

427
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,530
concerned about how some exposure may

428
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:36,370
impact my business and it's not just you

429
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,260
know my business as a service but my

430
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,290
whole portfolio of services and so I

431
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,270
think it's important to have this kind

432
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,210
of visibility whenever you're talking

433
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,910
about risk and I think this is where the

434
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,400
the problem really starts to to come

435
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:58,150
into it so not having such great luck

436
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,710
with technology right now so I think

437
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,260
this is all very nice it's a it's a

438
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,910
model that we can use when we look at

439
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,940
how a service is pieced together out of

440
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,860
you know piece parts where I've got my

441
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,390
own infrastructure I've got cloud

442
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,280
infrastructure I've got my own people

443
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,620
I've got business processes that work

444
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:21,820
overtop of it but it's really it's it's

445
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:27,580
never all that simple and so what we're

446
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,850
looking at here is this is from a

447
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,030
Microsoft publication for office 365 and

448
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,160
this is from a FedRAMP document so

449
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,610
FedRAMP lines obviously the NIST control

450
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,950
families out to how private sector deals

451
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,150
with them specifically around cloud

452
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,900
and so what Microsoft had to do in order

453
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,870
to satisfy that you know there was I'll

454
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,970
call it FedRAMP compliance or at least

455
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,940
FedRAMP kind of knowledge in their

456
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,440
services as they built this

457
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,110
authorization boundary diagram for

458
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,650
office 365 and I think this is I would

459
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,270
hate to be the guy that needed to draw

460
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,890
this I would hate even more to try to

461
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,800
trace risks through this but the fact is

462
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,320
that each one of those boxes is some

463
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,790
sort of system and each one of those

464
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,410
lines is some interaction between

465
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,810
systems and so you're going to have to

466
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,430
have for every one of those lines every

467
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,720
one of those boxes you need to

468
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,090
understand what controls do I have for

469
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,460
the lines you know what what am i

470
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,050
transferring across the boundary between

471
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,720
these systems it's the data flow it's

472
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,330
the you know and I'm gonna you know

473
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,010
start to use terms like it's the risk

474
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:36,590
flow you know I'm pushing risk up into

475
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,200
the system up into the top layer somehow

476
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,240
and I need to push controls back down

477
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,550
through the same kind of model so it can

478
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,900
get very complicated

479
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,350
I think there's a bit of a nice thing

480
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,890
though is that it's not just a morass

481
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,860
it's not just a cloud that's amorphous

482
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,890
it actually does have boxes around it so

483
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,810
this is the starting point of how I

484
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,690
believe that GRC and how the way you

485
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,020
manage this can can really start to work

486
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,900
is that if I say well that's giant

487
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,190
diagram it's going to be hard to take

488
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,110
care of all of that but let's start here

489
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,990
and we'll start with one little piece of

490
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,200
this and really build a big picture of

491
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,750
you know what controls this this piece

492
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,910
has what it's delivering what data is

493
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,610
flowing in and out there were there's

494
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,670
other people presenting on topics like

495
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:31,510
the Oh micro compartmentalization and on

496
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:34,610
you know boundaries layers and being

497
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,290
able to set up zones and that sort of

498
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,650
thing and those are all examples of this

499
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:40,970
sort of thing where you're really trying

500
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,370
to get down to a building block where

501
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,680
you can understand the whole context of

502
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,120
the building block and it's not just the

503
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,240
technology concept it's the RISC concept

504
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,430
associated with that building block it's

505
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:55,130
hard to get it really to risk because

506
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:55,779
there

507
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:57,849
some key elements of risk missing from

508
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:58,989
the picture when you're down at that

509
00:21:58,989 --> 00:22:01,450
building block layer but it's at least

510
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,519
possible to understand vulnerability

511
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,099
it's possible to understand exposure and

512
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:09,580
where you may have gaps so the as I say

513
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,519
the modeling can be complex but if you

514
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:14,139
take that kind of systematic approach to

515
00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:16,479
it you get to the point where you can

516
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:21,219
start to build up the picture again so

517
00:22:21,219 --> 00:22:23,409
let's talk about problem number two in

518
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:28,059
this which is control selection I think

519
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:31,719
that the Government of Canada in copying

520
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:34,629
NIST did a wonderful thing back when I

521
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:37,210
was doing spreadsheet based control

522
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,129
management you know what there was this

523
00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:40,779
statement that you know you need to

524
00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:43,059
introduce need to manage the baseline

525
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:44,379
security controls for the Government of

526
00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:46,509
Canada okay can you please hand me that

527
00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:49,239
list the answer is it didn't exist it

528
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:52,690
was a suite of policy and standard

529
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,279
documents where you needed to read

530
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:56,710
through the document and try to unpack

531
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,080
the words and figure out what controls

532
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,960
it it was talking about so back when I

533
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,419
was doing that kind of work I said could

534
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:06,639
we please just take FISMA scratch out

535
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:08,919
United States write in Canada scratch

536
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:10,450
our dough and be right in Treasury Board

537
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,070
and then pass it through Parliament and

538
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,690
then we'll just feed a little bit of

539
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,369
money into a nest because they do great

540
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:17,969
work on the documentation side of this

541
00:23:17,969 --> 00:23:20,889
it didn't happen the way I wanted but I

542
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:23,349
think with the introduction of I TSG 33

543
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:25,389
we came up with a really terrific thing

544
00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:29,769
for the government what it didn't help

545
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:32,950
all that much was private sector it

546
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,529
didn't help the cloud providers all that

547
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:37,210
much it helps a little bit because of

548
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,219
the strong alignment between the nist

549
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:42,429
and the the canadian framework and so

550
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:44,049
that means things like if you've done

551
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:46,599
FedRAMP as a cloud provider you're

552
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:49,419
probably going to fit nicely into the

553
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:51,729
Canadian world but there's some

554
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:54,039
differences and so let's go through you

555
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:56,639
know why control selection is a problem

556
00:23:56,639 --> 00:24:01,950
first is that on the FedRAMP side the

557
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,389
NIST and the sort of FedRAMP

558
00:24:04,389 --> 00:24:06,220
organization have really left it up to

559
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,900
the cloud provider

560
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,030
to determine what controls they're

561
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,980
implementing it's a good thing because

562
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,240
it means that you can go through

563
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,309
explicitly in state for this control we

564
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:18,040
are doing X Y Z and the client is

565
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,860
expected to do ABC in order to have full

566
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,320
control implementation so in that regard

567
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,520
the the FedRAMP framework is really nice

568
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,900
when I get down I'm going to skip down

569
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,450
to the Government of Canada so the

570
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,550
government has published a protected B

571
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:36,580
medium medium cloud profile again I

572
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,620
think that's really nice you know one of

573
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,270
the big things they did is they went

574
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,880
through and and said well for protected

575
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,320
B medium medium we need the following

576
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,750
controls to be in place and these are

577
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,860
the following ones where we have

578
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,890
expectations of a cloud provider so the

579
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,590
the ability to map out you know what the

580
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,270
club provider is to do and what the

581
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,790
customer is to do is is kind of already

582
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,920
spelled out and so as I say I think

583
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,730
that's terrific

584
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,190
but the cloud providers have other

585
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,050
problems to deal with they don't just

586
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,730
have government as a customer they've

587
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,380
got you know they may be offering

588
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,870
services that are handling payments and

589
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,610
they're using payment cards so there's

590
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:15,370
no way they can just do FedRAMP or ESG

591
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:20,140
33 they need to do PCI DSS and so now

592
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,110
they've got a control family that really

593
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,650
yes okay there's a crosswalk to the to

594
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,450
the NIST control family but it's

595
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,070
something that you need to manage on its

596
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,500
own the tests and evidence requirements

597
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,250
of PCI are very different from the test

598
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,809
and evidence requirements of the other

599
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:41,230
frameworks if you're handling financial

600
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,380
transactions as a service provider like

601
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,809
as a as an outsourcer you need these

602
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:50,650
Sauk controls and again you need to get

603
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,420
audit against that you needed a report

604
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,640
out on how you're doing against the Sox

605
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,390
sock one sock two and none of it

606
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,020
actually lines up all that well and you

607
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,970
start to throw in the compliance

608
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,559
requirement on top of risk management

609
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:08,820
and it goes absolutely haywire as a

610
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,580
Canadian bank especially any of our big

611
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,620
banks that have a footprint also outside

612
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,710
of Canada they're regulated by Asti and

613
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,550
the OCC and by you know Canadian private

614
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,470
teyla's oh it's not Canadian it's every

615
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,330
province has their own privacy laws and

616
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,910
it's also you know every every

617
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,950
jurisdiction they go into is going to

618
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,360
have another set of things they need to

619
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,780
comply with and all of those in my world

620
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,690
are controls that need to be implemented

621
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:40,230
and so this is as I say it's a bit of a

622
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,120
morass it's it's a really tough to

623
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,770
manage part of the picture so let's dive

624
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,960
into the next part of the picture and

625
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,150
then we'll elevate ourselves back up so

626
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,550
the next problem I see is the whole

627
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,340
thing around risk terminology and so

628
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,110
we've talked a little bit about controls

629
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,890
and so I go to my business and I say

630
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,410
I've got an issue with my identity and

631
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,920
access controls and the business says oh

632
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,180
what's the risk and then they owe the

633
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,070
the control guy goes back and he tries

634
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,830
to figure out well okay I think it's a

635
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,680
severe vulnerability so I'm gonna rate

636
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,040
the risk high and the business says high

637
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,510
risk oh my gosh what are we going to do

638
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,340
about that that whole conversation

639
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,240
shouldn't have happened because the risk

640
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,510
really is something where the business

641
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:36,390
should understand what risks and there

642
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,550
should be not a whole pile of them but

643
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,740
what are the actual risks of exposure

644
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,380
you know what is my risk of fraud what

645
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,040
is my risk of you know some sort of you

646
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,770
know information breached you to hacker

647
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,770
or other kinds of activities I want to

648
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,430
be able to elevate my risk discussion up

649
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,950
to those kinds of concepts so when I've

650
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,040
got an issue down at my control layer

651
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,250
the issue is not a risk on its own the

652
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,940
issue is an input into risk and so I

653
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,120
have this slide that talks about the the

654
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,870
gap so what is my risk I think your risk

655
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,350
is X it should have been what is the

656
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,540
severity of the vulnerability oh it's a

657
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,970
high severity vulnerability and so if

658
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,680
it's a high severity vulnerability which

659
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,620
of my known risks is has that now

660
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,130
elevated the known risk is oh this is

661
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,070
risk of reached you to fraud Act

662
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:39,030
okay so I've elevated it above my

663
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,860
threshold of Tolerance I therefore want

664
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,690
to do something about that particular

665
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,240
control so if somehow we could get the

666
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,760
language to move away from vulnerability

667
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,890
severity and issue and those sorts of

668
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,530
things and up into the risk we would

669
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,150
actually have a conversation that made

670
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,420
sense to everyone and that's where I

671
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,660
think there's a there's a good book on

672
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,330
risk management and I refer to this

673
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:07,870
particular formula a lot I'm assuming

674
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,070
everybody in the room or most of the

675
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,290
people have seen this somewhere and this

676
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,640
is so this is out of the Harmonized

677
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,800
threat risk assessment methodology and

678
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,220
this is a fantastic model because what

679
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,220
it does is it breaks down risk into the

680
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,810
major building blocks of risk

681
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,940
I've got asset value oh I've got an

682
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,890
issue that's elevating my asset value

683
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,510
great what are we going to do about that

684
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,820
I've got an issue that's increasing my

685
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,670
threat exposure I you know hold on the

686
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,900
firewall yeah

687
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:45,259
identify as a government Silver Bullet

688
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:47,629
for security great part of the marketing

689
00:29:47,629 --> 00:29:50,199
in front of us

690
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:23,150
well I think if you look at ith g-33 we

691
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,980
all talk about the control library part

692
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,350
of it what we tend to overlook is the

693
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,640
fact that it has a risk management

694
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,760
framework in it so I think yes it does

695
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,840
help I like this particular equation

696
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,660
because it says okay asset value threat

697
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,030
environment vulnerability and then when

698
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,580
I talk about the control world anytime I

699
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,530
have a failed control I can equate that

700
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,810
to a vulnerability and so it's just is

701
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:50,540
this very straight line between you know

702
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,740
can the control world vulnerability

703
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:58,100
possibly threat management and rarely

704
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,250
asset value so it means that you can

705
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:04,190
generally equate issues to one of those

706
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,620
either vulnerability or threat elements

707
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,020
of risk but it means that you need to

708
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,960
have now kind of a risk library as

709
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,510
opposed to saying what is the risk and

710
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,190
trying to develop it from the ground up

711
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,690
you should be able to do this from the

712
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:22,490
top down so let's look at a little bit

713
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,590
of what I see is the solution that's I'm

714
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,180
hoping to present more than just what

715
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:33,410
the problems are and as a guy who works

716
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,600
with RSA Archer a lot which is a GRC

717
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,120
product I'm obviously very interested in

718
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,070
that but I also do work with other GRC

719
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,260
products and I thought let's start with

720
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,590
somebody else's model for GRC and so

721
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:48,890
this was a model for GRC that was

722
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:51,100
published by an academic group out of

723
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,620
Portugal I believe and I really like

724
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,840
this because it's a reference model it

725
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,690
shows me what the data elements of

726
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,380
managing risks should look

727
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,780
like and I think this is really cool

728
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,030
because right there I can say they even

729
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,070
called out that issue and risk are not

730
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,710
the same thing that there are separate

731
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,230
objects and they have control as

732
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,940
separate from each one of those things

733
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,130
and policy is really you know controls

734
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,280
relate to policies and policy you know

735
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,900
it gets derived from laws and

736
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,270
regulations and so on and so this is a

737
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,490
really interesting diagram because it

738
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:29,490
basically pieces together all of those

739
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,120
elements that we were talking about and

740
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,730
what I really glean from this myself and

741
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,290
I don't know if anybody else does is

742
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,270
that if you try to put this in a

743
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:43,080
spreadsheet you can't because what it is

744
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,320
is a relational data model that

745
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,250
essentially each one of those items

746
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,840
would need to be a tab in a spreadsheet

747
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,570
and so you would have a I didn't count

748
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,460
them there's no 25 objects up there

749
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,320
you'd need 25 tabs and somehow you'd

750
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,940
need to build cross references between

751
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,100
the rows in you know your control

752
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,750
spreadsheet with the rows and the issue

753
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,460
spreadsheet with the rows in the risk

754
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,190
spreadsheet and oh my gosh that's a big

755
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,970
job to do and so this is where the GRC

756
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,790
tools have evolved from is that they've

757
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,830
recognized that you know trying to

758
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,830
manage things like you know SRTM okay

759
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,260
that's a control list I can do that in a

760
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,260
spreadsheet but now trying to build a

761
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,800
poem from that I need to refer back to

762
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,720
my spreadsheet and I can't put it in the

763
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,120
same spreadsheet and so just that one

764
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,240
thing on its own has created a tooling

765
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,730
problem and so this is where as I say I

766
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:38,610
think the the GRC tools really help with

767
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:41,970
with that kind of picture another one

768
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,490
that I I like a lot but I've never found

769
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:47,400
a use for is the unified compliance

770
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,490
framework and so there's a does

771
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:54,000
everybody does anybody know UCF okay

772
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,130
it's a bit of an American thing so it's

773
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,610
not well adopted in Canada but what they

774
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,210
did is they've taken hundreds of

775
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,890
regulations and standards and mapped

776
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:07,250
them through to a common control library

777
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,739
the problem is that the common control

778
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,418
library is their own it doesn't actually

779
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:13,940
relate to any

780
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,989
kind of pre-existing proven framework so

781
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,840
it's on its I believe the UCF their

782
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,840
model is terrific the actual output and

783
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,170
the controls themselves are hard to

784
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:30,080
adopt you would have difficulty saying

785
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,840
I'm compliant with you know with the

786
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,469
controls furred I TSG 33 because I'm

787
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:38,840
doing UCF but as I say it's got some

788
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,120
nice things about it it takes the you

789
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,590
know the authority documents the

790
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,719
regulations and standards and so on and

791
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,280
ultimately maps them up to something

792
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,400
they call controls and then has the idea

793
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,350
of audit and testing of controls and

794
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:57,139
that kind of thing and then this is I

795
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:59,390
think this is more specific to the

796
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,880
archer product and so this is how

797
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,470
they've implemented it there's something

798
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,390
that they they have policy management

799
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,790
where they get down to the clauses or

800
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,610
the provisions of a policy that relates

801
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:15,860
to a screen going off I don't know if

802
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,930
it's the cable or what the story is it

803
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,090
it's come back up a couple of times and

804
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:23,020
seems to not be right now there we go

805
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,090
and but then it gives you the ability to

806
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,810
relate what becomes your control library

807
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:37,820
oh nice and now it's gonna start

808
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:42,530
flashing even better I knew I shouldn't

809
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:48,500
have used my own laptop fully seated

810
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,530
okay well let's hope it holds up I'll

811
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,910
flash through the rest of the slides so

812
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:56,060
you can memorize them anyway so the idea

813
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,670
here is that the you create your own you

814
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:02,210
create your own control library and you

815
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:04,610
have the ability now to say okay you

816
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,900
know assign these controls I'm going to

817
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,180
allocate these controls to this system

818
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,970
I'm going to test these controls and so

819
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,860
it's a it's a tool that has implemented

820
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,560
what is fundamentally that reference

821
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,190
model this is my dream world this is the

822
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,830
question you asked about is how do we

823
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,660
get communications of what's going on

824
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,120
across that contractual boundary oh well

825
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,830
we're just going to federated

826
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:30,920
our ctools if everybody had a GRC tool

827
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,470
that'd be fantastic but the idea here is

828
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,660
that you should we don't even need

829
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,670
people all using the same control

830
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,830
libraries what we need is that you know

831
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,450
that crosswalk we need the ability to

832
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,670
say if you've done pci and have those

833
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,800
controls in place and demonstrated to

834
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,990
you know the satisfaction of an

835
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:50,540
inspector then we should be able to say

836
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,190
oh that means that you've got you know

837
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:56,390
sc7 in place and so i want you to you

838
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,790
know tell me that you've got it i want

839
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,530
to you know want you to show me through

840
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,810
evidence how that control is in place

841
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,940
and if there's any issues with that

842
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,740
control i just want you to tell me about

843
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,190
it

844
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,710
and so what that should be able to do is

845
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,870
have the ability for us to manage our

846
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:14,470
service at the top layer everybody's

847
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:17,450
spreadsheets everybody's GRC tools feed

848
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:20,690
up into the that picture and so now if i

849
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:23,750
have a control failure it it gets

850
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,580
bubbled up to the top and i can say okay

851
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,940
i've got a control failure it's a medium

852
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,660
severity vulnerability it's related to

853
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,690
the following risk and therefore the

854
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,570
risk has elevated from low to moderate

855
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,790
but i'm still okay with moderate so i'm

856
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,020
not going to do anything about it

857
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,960
or i'm sort of okay let's make sure the

858
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,240
plan to resolve is going to happen fast

859
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,670
enough so my you know time horizon on

860
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:53,600
the risk exposure is managed so as i say

861
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,580
there's this world where you need the

862
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,410
tool in order to manage all of these

863
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:59,480
elements and if we were then able to

864
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,960
digitally transform the the GRC world we

865
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,870
would be able to have not just the the

866
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,640
abstraction layer of the cloud provider

867
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,490
the abstraction layer would include some

868
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:14,600
kind of feed up of the you know the

869
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,480
things they're responsible for and you

870
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,730
would be able to then calculate how it

871
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,750
impacts your risk so that's the major

872
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:26,620
elements of what we're dealing with the

873
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,690
one of the things that the GRC tools do

874
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,430
is deal with the fact that people manage

875
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:34,790
risk at multiple layers you do risk

876
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,860
management as risk management but you do

877
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,320
owe control testing and audit as

878
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,190
something else you do business content

879
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,560
newett e-business impact assessment and

880
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,180
business continuity management on its

881
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:49,380
own you do gonna lose track of what all

882
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,760
the other things are but you do all of

883
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,010
these risk management activities they've

884
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,349
all got something in common they all say

885
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:58,530
I've assessed that this risk exists and

886
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,810
I've given you some sort of an estimate

887
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,180
of how big the risk is and I've put a

888
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,089
plan in place to fix it so they all have

889
00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:08,579
this identified risk plan to resolve or

890
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,260
plan to treat the risk

891
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,510
they've all got that exactly in common

892
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,700
so why don't they talk to each other you

893
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,400
know why does the risk that guy writing

894
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,800
the TRA say oh I need the PIAA before I

895
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,410
can finish my tra but the guy doing the

896
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,540
PIAA says oh I need your tra before I

897
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,339
can finish my PIAA it's like you're

898
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:29,000
talking about the same thing risk and

899
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,619
yes there are different kinds of risks

900
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,050
but we really should be able to abstract

901
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:36,690
risk up to a more common business level

902
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:40,530
discussion so the GRC tools do a lot

903
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:43,200
more but I think the major thing I'm

904
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,810
here to you know pitch is that the whole

905
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,970
world of managing risk across that

906
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,609
contractual boundary relies on specific

907
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:53,460
kinds of information and we really need

908
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,829
people talking the same language in

909
00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:59,400
order to bring that to a risk type

910
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,880
discussion so I think the the the big

911
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,980
problem of you know the total amount of

912
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,930
data it can amount in the more I do

913
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:09,329
micro micro compartmentalization the

914
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:11,369
worse my problem gets because typically

915
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:13,260
control mapping is what's referred to as

916
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,200
an N squared problem where the more

917
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,240
things you introduce it doesn't just

918
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,500
multiply the number of things you

919
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,869
introduced it multiplies by some power

920
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:25,130
of the number of things you introduced

921
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:29,960
so I think I'm gonna wrap there

922
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:44,440
