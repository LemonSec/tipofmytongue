2
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:08,069
so thank you so much I was really

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:09,719
excited to get this invitation in part

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,019
because I've been wanting to connect

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,519
more with folks who are in cybersecurity

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,830
research more properly I work on

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,449
influencer operations so a little bit of

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,140
a different space but because of the

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,580
ways that we see things evolving

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,810
particularly challenges around

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,090
attribution of influence operations and

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,060
ways in which hack and leak is active it

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,549
kind of provides the fodder for so much

14
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,530
of it we one of the things we're looking

15
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,570
at at Stanford is trying to develop a

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,120
better understanding of how these two

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,440
types of actions fit together and what

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,210
we can learn about that and how we

19
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,890
should be thinking about disinformation

20
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,690
and influencer operations is kind of a

21
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,670
new normal and how we're going to be

22
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,190
thinking about responding to them so

23
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,620
I've been studying this topic since

24
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,530
around 2015 me look like that's

25
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,480
advancing here but not for you guys are

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,540
you seeing that there we go all right so

27
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,200
this is a network graph of the

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,159
conversation around vaccines in

29
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,890
California and 2015 which was some of

30
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,960
the work that I did just as I was just a

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,490
mom I was doing this at night because I

32
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,680
was trying to figure out we were trying

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,570
to get this law passed in California and

34
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,490
it was around eliminating the right to

35
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,229
opt your child out of vaccines for

36
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:26,549
school we used to have a system where

37
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:27,840
you could just sign a paper and then you

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,520
didn't have to vaccinate your kid so I

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,939
found this egregious and started working

40
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,369
late at night trying to understand who

41
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,470
was driving the anti-vaccine movement in

42
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,630
California what we could learn about

43
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,189
those conversations on social platforms

44
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:44,310
and how what appeared to be very small

45
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,990
groups of people were really able to

46
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,360
command the conversation so looking not

47
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,280
so much at influencer operations in the

48
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,840
maligned subversive sense of the word

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,909
but really more an understanding of how

50
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,590
had be in the kind of information

51
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,920
architecture shift and the resulting

52
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,689
kind of proliferation of many types of

53
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:03,090
voices also in some ways led to a

54
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,040
framework in which very very tiny groups

55
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,149
of people could really achieve a

56
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:07,500
disproportionate impact on the

57
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,929
conversation and so we were using social

58
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,520
network analysis just to try to

59
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,740
understand what was happening

60
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,540
they're in that conversation this was

61
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,900
the hashtag SB 277 which was the name

62
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,460
that our bill was given in California

63
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,490
and this is not really the thing to

64
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,620
focus on but if you've never delved into

65
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,390
one of these basically the larger

66
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,270
circles indicate you kind of a it's a

67
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,800
measure of centrality just how important

68
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,350
a voice is to a conversation the lines

69
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,090
are showing who's talking to who is

70
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,310
replying to who and the different colors

71
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,130
represent the different clusters of

72
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,630
community in a conversations this is how

73
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,520
we can understand people who talk about

74
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,350
particular topics we can kind of group

75
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,470
them into factions so down in the orange

76
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,390
you had the autism community so people

77
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,430
who regularly spoke about autism the

78
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,830
pink or the kind of diehard anti-vaxxers

79
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,420
they'd been anti-vaxxers for a very long

80
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,090
time so you can see that you know autism

81
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,220
conversation is distinct from vaccines

82
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,630
cause autism conversation

83
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,480
the teal kind of vertical cluster there

84
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,210
was actually the hashtag people who are

85
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,950
also participating in the hashtag to a

86
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,930
witch in the US a second amendment gun

87
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,060
rights wire anti-vaxxers talking to

88
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,590
people and gun rights because they were

89
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,450
trying to kind of push the narrative

90
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,250
that vaccines were vast government

91
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,680
overreach and trying to draw more people

92
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,870
from who were aligned with the idea that

93
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,580
any government action was vast

94
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,860
government overreach into their network

95
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,810
to to serve as amplifiers for their

96
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,600
message and then the kind of dark blue

97
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,040
tiny cluster was actually what was

98
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,810
interesting here and that was really

99
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,660
looking at the emergence of aunt Eve

100
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,140
accents who were pivoting into serving

101
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,790
as the bridge between those communities

102
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,800
where they stopped chocking entirely

103
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,660
about the vaccines cause autism thing

104
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,580
really moved into redefining their

105
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,740
conversation in this new narrative about

106
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,780
government overreach that seemed to be

107
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,730
serving them better and then the other

108
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,800
finding was the green dots over there in

109
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,360
the corner that are talking to no one

110
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,520
and have no centrality whatsoever was

111
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,650
the public health community and so what

112
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,000
we were trying to show here was the

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,290
extent to which this was a conversation

114
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,050
in which the voices that were supposed

115
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,520
to serve as kind of like countervailing

116
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,230
narratives the counter speeches were so

117
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,270
fond of calling it in America we're not

118
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,829
actually counter speaking to any of the

119
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,320
people and we're achieving no reach no

120
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,358
amplification whatsoever so ironically

121
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,979
the Green are what you would think of as

122
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,330
traditional authority figures

123
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,820
traditional institutional folks from the

124
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,420
CDC

125
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,160
the World Health Organization so this

126
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,710
was an example just of how we were doing

127
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,300
that analysis to understand who was

128
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,800
talking to whom and why now at the same

129
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,920
time a friend of mine over at Brookings

130
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,500
was doing identical work looking at Isis

131
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,890
and one of the things is also 2015 this

132
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,630
is not my work this is from the ISIS

133
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,460
Twitter census out of Brookings which

134
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,200
highly recommend even today is still a

135
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,230
fascinating read this is links among the

136
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,810
top 500 Twitter accounts as supported by

137
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,070
the in-group metric used to identify

138
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,810
Isis supporters and the red lines

139
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,210
indicated reciprocal relationships so

140
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,950
there - we were looking at understanding

141
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,390
how does a narrative spread how's a

142
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,120
narrative disseminated what degree like

143
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,040
what shapes what topology do we see in

144
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,420
these networks to try to understand

145
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,690
again how was Isis so good at commanding

146
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,580
a narrative on Twitter which if you all

147
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,680
remember back to 2015 this was a very

148
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,860
significant issue so we were comparing

149
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,110
our findings me on the anti-vaxxers him

150
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,820
on Isis and really just discovering that

151
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,550
again very small groups of highly

152
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,680
interlinked people could get things

153
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,630
trending could game the algorithms and

154
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,760
could really make it so that their

155
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,690
message was the message that was seen so

156
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,360
the dissemination of the narrative is a

157
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,400
function of the rules of the ecosystem

158
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,040
in which it's being spread and so one of

159
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,660
the things that we came to this

160
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,520
conclusion in 2015 that disinformation

161
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,410
campaigns were not a truth and narrative

162
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,510
issue disinformation campaigns and

163
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,890
influence operations are actually a

164
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,440
systems level problem because the

165
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,420
architecture the information ecosystem

166
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,850
is designed to facilitate this sharing

167
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,010
across platform this was a thing that

168
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,120
you know all the platforms have the

169
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,470
button where you can share it or did

170
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,630
four till about two or three years ago

171
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,310
where you could share you know your

172
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,780
Twitter would push to your Facebook your

173
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,130
Facebook could do the same thing in

174
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,140
Reverse and it was the idea that they

175
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,000
wanted information to kind of flow

176
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,980
across the network but nobody at any

177
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,960
point was doing any kind of checking for

178
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,970
what was flowing across the network or

179
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,840
how it was um how it was working so the

180
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,910
platform's kind of inadvertently set the

181
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,230
rules of a game that they weren't

182
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,940
necessarily aware that they were even

183
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,450
designing we began to think of this is

184
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,980
actually a kind of dual use technology

185
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,050
right something that any group of people

186
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,350
could use but as we

187
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,350
creasing Li saw Isis was using it and

188
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,390
that became a very real problem and then

189
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,220
the kind of whisper conversation that

190
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,140
was already happening in 2015 was that

191
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,300
Russia was using it as well you may

192
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,270
remember that the Adrian Chen's article

193
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,580
the agency had come out already in June

194
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,610
2015 and so the the internet research

195
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,080
agency was already a thing that was not

196
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,610
known only to the national security

197
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,800
community but was actually in fact known

198
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,180
among anybody in the public who was

199
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,750
paying attention as well so just to do

200
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,370
kind of a quick walk through for how

201
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,310
this all plays out we started thinking

202
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,610
about the early olden days of the

203
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,380
internet you all had like geo cities

204
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,600
blogs and such I imagine I know I did

205
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,290
so the idea of zero cost publishing ways

206
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,210
in which we transform the information

207
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,860
architecture by making it to the Navy

208
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,420
and everybody had a voice which was

209
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,640
fantastic and in the early days of blogs

210
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,070
that was still very decentralized so you

211
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,240
could write whatever you wanted

212
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,220
misinformation propaganda of course

213
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,170
proliferated then as well nobody was

214
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,840
arguing that this was a new problem but

215
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,970
when you began to layer in the era of

216
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,950
social networks and the mass

217
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,010
consolidation of audiences you know 300

218
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,300
and something million people I think on

219
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,220
Twitter and a billion on Facebook you

220
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,950
start to see this this audience this

221
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,600
ready-made standing audience that's

222
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,550
available for any propagandist who wants

223
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,460
to use it then because these platforms

224
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,800
have to earn revenue somehow you see the

225
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,900
advent of the advertising based business

226
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,450
model which comes with it monitoring and

227
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,430
precision targeting a phrase that isn't

228
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,050
in the US has used quite commonly as

229
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,240
surveillance capitalism but the idea

230
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,830
that the platforms the more that they

231
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,000
know about you the better they can

232
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,860
target you that's done of course in

233
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,740
service to ads and in terms of you know

234
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,240
their ability to sell highly targeted

235
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,950
ads requires them to know a fair bit

236
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,190
about who you are but that targeting is

237
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,200
also used then it's also incorporated

238
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,750
into algorithmic curation and this is

239
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,909
where as everybody becomes a content

240
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:39,309
creator on this handful of platforms the

241
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,229
platforms are forced into a into a

242
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,940
position where in order to create a good

243
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,000
experience they have to curate and this

244
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,350
is where we move from the reverse

245
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,540
chronological feed into the curated feed

246
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,790
which is one of the kind of major shifts

247
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,190
that actually makes it that actually

248
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,030
really rien

249
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,940
forces the idea that what is sensational

250
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,520
what is extreme is much more likely to

251
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,170
be engaged with because the algorithm

252
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,960
recognizes that that you know it starts

253
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,790
to see these indicators of emotional

254
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,430
engagement of virality and it begins to

255
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,310
amplify that content so the platform's

256
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,200
have to curate your content in order to

257
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,270
keep you on site so that they can keep

258
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,180
serving you ad so this becomes a

259
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,890
self-fulfilling cycle the out the

260
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,230
algorithmic amplification piece is where

261
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,270
users are drawn into the participatory

262
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,400
nature of this every time you click to

263
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,190
share you've reinforced you've generated

264
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,440
a signal that indicates that this

265
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,670
information is something that other

266
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,800
people could see when Twitter has a

267
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,980
trending algorithm and you may remember

268
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,630
Facebook used to have one as well

269
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,090
that was really just based originally on

270
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,130
pure signals of engagement so the

271
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,620
amplification would come if a sufficient

272
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,240
number of people could game the

273
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,340
algorithm all use the same hashtag at

274
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,080
the same time and get something trending

275
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,090
so this of course has unintended

276
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,100
consequences becomes a dual use

277
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,320
technology as government's all over the

278
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,050
world as terrorist organizations as you

279
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,520
know groups of people begin to realize

280
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,810
that this is a phenomenal vector for the

281
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,600
dissemination of propaganda and if

282
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,760
regular rank-and-file people can achieve

283
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,160
this kind of morality and this this sort

284
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,570
of command of the information

285
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:21,600
architecture then they can as well so

286
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,060
what we begin to see now is over the

287
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,660
last I think five years we've seen case

288
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,220
study as Oxford does something really

289
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,510
great work on this there's case studies

290
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,550
detailing computational propaganda as

291
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,260
it's come to be called and malign

292
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,180
influence activity in Brazil Canada

293
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,640
China Estonia France Germany India Italy

294
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,830
around Mexico Myanmar the Philippines

295
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,990
Poland Russia I could go on and on the

296
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,850
US we've got the terrorists up there too

297
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,310
so the list continues to grow and as

298
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:52,270
we've begun now with five years of case

299
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,030
studies and an evidence of this kind of

300
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,290
activity patterns have begun to emerge

301
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,090
so this is our collection of actors who

302
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,040
regularly at this point are running

303
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,690
these play books you have the state

304
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,430
actors they're by far the most well

305
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,920
resourced they also often control

306
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,410
Ecosystem the mainstream media in their

307
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,930
countries which affords them kind of an

308
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,690
extra boost as propaganda splits between

309
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,029
narrative dissemination across the media

310
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:21,670
versus mimetic social dissemination on

311
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,920
the networks so state actors are the

312
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,199
best resource sophisticated terrorist

313
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:28,600
organizations like Isis did in fact run

314
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,550
their own media organizations as well

315
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,130
they had magazines they they were again

316
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,870
running the same two-track parallel

317
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,720
between narrative propaganda and mimetic

318
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,540
social propaganda domestic ideologues

319
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,399
less well resourced but oftentimes

320
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,920
particularly in the u.s. well networked

321
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,139
into the media ecosystem again you see

322
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,120
that same sort of thing and then as

323
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,880
we've begun to see the mercenaries I'm

324
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,019
not going to talk about this today

325
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:55,120
because it just came out last week but

326
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,260
one of the things that we just did at

327
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,300
Stanford was we worked with Facebook to

328
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,360
identify a network of mercenaries

329
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,550
attributed to yevgeniy provision

330
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,410
operating in Africa 83 pages eight

331
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,380
countries the franchise model in which

332
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,079
the actual execution of the operation is

333
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:12,730
carried out by local social media

334
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,490
enterprises who probably don't know who

335
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,380
is paying them there's there's a the

336
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,940
opportunity to really launder things

337
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,920
down to mercenaries who are willing to

338
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,730
carry out these operations for money and

339
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,800
then the last is spammers which you know

340
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,410
there are more of the kind of throw it

341
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,699
at the wall see what sticks they know

342
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:31,660
they're gonna lose their accounts

343
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,920
constantly it doesn't really matter so

344
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,839
much to them but we do see spammers as

345
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:38,050
an active part of this ecosystem so in

346
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,370
addition to kind of mapping out the

347
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,350
actors we've begun kind of trying to

348
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,149
quantify the goals apologies for the

349
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:46,120
word slide here but it again the goals

350
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,220
run the gamut you can roughly group them

351
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,339
into persuasion distraction the

352
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:53,500
persuasion style is really looking to

353
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,300
make people feel or think a certain way

354
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,760
about a topic that's often a lot harder

355
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,850
because that involves changing hearts

356
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,040
and minds and as anybody who's ever run

357
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,870
an advertising campaign or marketing

358
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,060
campaign knows that's not always easy so

359
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,370
some of this operates in the persuasion

360
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,019
space where you can develop a long term

361
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:13,300
relationship and really repeatedly put

362
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,889
out content because it's through

363
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:17,319
repetition and availability that that

364
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:19,569
kind of narrative takes hold the other

365
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:21,699
thing though the other rough bucket that

366
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:22,660
we see is

367
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,330
the distraction make it too hard for

368
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,130
people to figure out what the hell is

369
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,590
going on the kind of canonical example

370
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,140
of this for anybody who pays attention

371
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,470
to it is the hashtag mh17 that was the

372
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,570
Malaysia Airlines jet that was shot down

373
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,090
over Ukraine that triggered a rather

374
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,490
panicked response in which the zone was

375
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,950
flooded with dozens and dozens and

376
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,780
dozens of explanations for how the

377
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,450
actual perpetrators responsible were in

378
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,430
fact not and so that's where you just

379
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,710
blast out as much crap as you can into

380
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,050
the hashtag to make it so that anybody

381
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,730
who's going and looking and trying to

382
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,620
understand what's happening either has

383
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,600
to follow only their own trusted media

384
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,310
because the social ecosystem becomes

385
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:10,180
relatively useless so the kind of broad

386
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,260
takeaway from that is that

387
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,000
disinformation is not a truth and

388
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,430
narrative problem it's you're not going

389
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,150
to solve it by factoring back in

390
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,740
2015-2016 we still thought that there

391
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,690
was an opportunity to really just if you

392
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,850
got the fact check out you were going to

393
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,040
solve the problem that's just not true

394
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,780
and that's because velocity and ver

395
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,120
allottee ensure that this has gone viral

396
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,640
already this kind of just the sheer

397
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,950
ability to use BOTS and algorithmic

398
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,530
amplification to flood a zone means that

399
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,270
you are never going to reach the same

400
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,220
amount of people with the fact-check so

401
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,290
we started thinking less about how do we

402
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,120
handle this as a fact-checking issue and

403
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,920
more about how do we think about this as

404
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,140
a dissemination problem as a as an

405
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,280
information traversal problem so there's

406
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,080
a really great quote that I want to just

407
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,360
make sure I don't botch from American

408
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,240
and American Enterprise Institute Phil

409
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,060
lo house and he says something that I

410
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,350
think is interesting from the standpoint

411
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,660
of this bridge between disinformation

412
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,690
and cybersecurity we tend to think of

413
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,370
our cyber defenses as physical

414
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,530
barricades barring access from would-be

415
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,450
perpetrators and of information

416
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,310
campaigns as retrograde and ineffective

417
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,530
in other words we continue to focus on

418
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,240
the walls of the castle while our

419
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,010
enemies are devising methods to poison

420
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:28,510
the air so recognizing that when we

421
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,190
think about addressing the problem of

422
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,080
computational disinformation campaigns

423
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,490
one of the things that we've been

424
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,350
starting to do is look at intelligence

425
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,339
driven defense which

426
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:38,350
how can we take our understanding again

427
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,509
not as how do we counter one narrative

428
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:42,910
or deal with one adversary but how do we

429
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,999
think about a staged process for four

430
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:48,160
really kind of quantifying understanding

431
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,809
and then looking at places to intercede

432
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:52,899
so this is one of the things where you

433
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:54,759
know a major advancement in the practice

434
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,220
of Defense Information Security has been

435
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,569
the adoption of intelligence driven

436
00:15:58,569 --> 00:15:59,259
defense

437
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,089
we're defensive teams base their plans

438
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:03,480
and priorities on models of attacker

439
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,439
capabilities and techniques based on

440
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:07,449
observational evidence so how do we take

441
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:10,360
those 53 case studies of the kind of

442
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,579
matrix of actors and goals and come up

443
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:15,819
with models for understanding what this

444
00:16:15,819 --> 00:16:18,309
looks like so I know there's kind of

445
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:19,569
mixed feelings about the kill chain

446
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:23,410
itself but the metaphor is something

447
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,879
that's been really appealing to us as

448
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:27,189
we've begun to think about how to get

449
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:28,769
ourselves out of just talking about

450
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:31,389
truth in narrative so we've been

451
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:34,779
thinking more about how disinformation

452
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:37,089
campaigns unload they kind of unfold

453
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:39,610
across the series of stages they're

454
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,949
largely invisible to the audience until

455
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:43,899
they hit the end stages when all of a

456
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:45,850
sudden the audience sees the content so

457
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,189
how do we look further up the chain and

458
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:51,069
understand where the what are the things

459
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:52,660
that the attackers are consistently

460
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,179
doing in order to enable that sort of

461
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:58,620
the sort of mass blast at the end

462
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:00,429
probably most of you in the room have

463
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:02,079
seen this this is me just grabbing a

464
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,279
Lockheed version there's a couple of

465
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,079
other versions but this is sort of the

466
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:09,010
process by which you can achieve kind of

467
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,709
control and then effect act like effect

468
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:14,289
actions on an you know objectives so

469
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:16,089
what we're trying to do here is think in

470
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,640
a similar way about what is the staging

471
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,760
process by which this is happening so

472
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,220
there we go this is the world's most

473
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,809
primitive graphic this is something I

474
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:32,250
made for a Senate briefing in early 2017

475
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,600
this was literally me trying to explain

476
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,799
to lawmakers how this worked so so but I

477
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,330
keep this slide around actually just to

478
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,110
show you where we were in 2017 really it

479
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,970
was a very repetitive process there was

480
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,169
actually nothing remarkable about it

481
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:48,399
everybody did the same thing over and

482
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:50,140
over again you would plan your opera

483
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,700
raishin in these little groups mostly

484
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,650
where people communicate one-on-one

485
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,480
sometimes they're very overt sometimes

486
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,800
it's like reddit where anyone can go and

487
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,720
read it other times they're much more

488
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,820
they move more and more into quiet

489
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,120
spaces discord servers you know we chat

490
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,070
or whatsapp groups so that becomes

491
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,780
actually this is an example of things

492
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,170
that as the practice evolves no longer

493
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,000
can you see people on reddit or 4chan

494
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,440
just kind of talking about their

495
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,360
operation out there in the public that

496
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,370
moves more and more into into quieter

497
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,980
spaces then there's the content creation

498
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,600
the content creation piece is

499
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,370
interesting because they're using their

500
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,680
hosting their content on platforms that

501
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,210
are going to give them algorithmic lift

502
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,030
as well so it so it's a kind of a you

503
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,130
know that we've created even YouTube and

504
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,320
imager in the places where you would

505
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,700
ordinarily in the olden days you would

506
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,990
have had to like host your content on

507
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,330
your blog and then drive people to it if

508
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,250
you create something that's in any way

509
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,260
compelling the platform itself

510
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,700
particularly if you get the keywords

511
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,550
right will begin to serve that content

512
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,560
up as well then there's the main

513
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,170
campaign tumblr is still in there

514
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,020
tumblr really doesn't exist anymore but

515
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,150
the but but this was where we would see

516
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,070
this content manifesting so you'd see

517
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,780
Isis on all of these channels Russia on

518
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,480
all of these channels the campaign piece

519
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,060
varies regionally so as I'm looking at

520
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,460
Taiwan right now we see a lot more stuff

521
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,960
on like line and some of the message

522
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,820
boards that are unique to the

523
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,040
information ecosystem where people are

524
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,740
spending their time so any attacker is

525
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,080
going to go to where the target is and

526
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,820
so one of the things that we're always

527
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,010
looking at is where are the people in a

528
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,720
given region doesn't do a whole lot of

529
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,010
good one of the things we saw with the

530
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,960
Russia Africa operation that came down

531
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,970
last week was the use of whatsapp and

532
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,860
telegram and that's because that's where

533
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,200
people in the region that those are the

534
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,700
tools that they're using so they're on

535
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,980
Facebook which is one way that actually

536
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,530
outside researchers can see them but

537
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,790
they're increasingly moving more and

538
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,550
more into into group messages and sort

539
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,710
of you know sort of either end-to-end

540
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,300
encrypted spaces or spaces where you

541
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,480
have to be invited in and then the final

542
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,370
piece though is how do you cross the

543
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,320
chasm so you're either doing you're

544
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,180
doing one of two things you can persuade

545
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,340
your small tiny cluster of people and

546
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,720
they're not always the smallest

547
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,280
sometimes as in the u.s. there are

548
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:03,820
hundreds of

549
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,320
to people but so you're working on your

550
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,600
clusters but what you really want to do

551
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,460
is create the narrative that crosses the

552
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,470
chasm and hits mainstream media because

553
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,450
then at that point you have you begin to

554
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,309
dominate the entirety of the media

555
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:17,799
narrative the kind of canonical example

556
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,379
of this is the GRU hackin leak in 2016

557
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:22,479
where even though we focus much more on

558
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:24,489
Internet research agency activity which

559
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,889
was the social propaganda the thing that

560
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:29,739
really commanded the narrative was the

561
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:32,080
GRU hack & league operation which drove

562
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,669
mainstream media narrative about our

563
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:35,830
campaign they tranche the releases so

564
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,769
every time a new release comes out US

565
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:40,210
mainstream media covers it as a

566
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,700
newsworthy thing WikiLeaks is pushing it

567
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,499
which has millions of followers and then

568
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:46,119
you see the internet research agency

569
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,879
come in take it make memes about it and

570
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:51,159
push it out again so you see hack and

571
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:54,549
leak operating in conjunction with even

572
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:55,899
if not deliberately coordinated

573
00:20:55,899 --> 00:20:58,239
temporarily coordinated with the social

574
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,539
influence side of the operation this is

575
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:05,259
the world's ugliest graphic but this is

576
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:06,659
how we're starting to think about

577
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:09,549
understanding the staged process using

578
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:12,159
the kind of fifty-some-odd examples that

579
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,669
we have so I still be coming out in a in

580
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:17,529
a report and it'll look different than

581
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:19,809
this but for today we're thinking about

582
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:22,330
creation of operational resources one of

583
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,429
the things that they all use is fake

584
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:27,070
accounts you have to have the fake

585
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,809
accounts and so the easiest place to

586
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:31,330
intercede is with a better understanding

587
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,909
of what it means to be authentic on the

588
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:35,470
internet that of course is a huge

589
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,960
challenge particularly because it really

590
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,419
in the u.s. at least triggers a lot of

591
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:42,700
political opinions about the value of

592
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,190
pseudonymity and anonymity what are we

593
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,499
saying about who is authentic who has

594
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:50,289
the right to participate but at the same

595
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:52,359
time there is this is why it's dual use

596
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:55,299
the recognition that that there is a lot

597
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:57,549
of opportunity for other entities to

598
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,349
kind of conceal themselves in those

599
00:21:59,349 --> 00:22:02,499
spaces I'm going to go through these now

600
00:22:02,499 --> 00:22:04,869
kind of one at a time with examples

601
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:06,429
drawn from different influence

602
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:08,529
operations and I'll talk a little bit

603
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:11,980
about what we saw in those so first for

604
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,889
creation of operational resources as I'm

605
00:22:14,889 --> 00:22:16,419
sure many of you know there's a black

606
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:17,610
market for digit

607
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,710
you can go and you can buy Facebook

608
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,740
accounts you can purchase there's this

609
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,330
is one of them that I screenshot it

610
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,460
actually two years ago in 2017 there are

611
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,100
dozens of these you can go by by region

612
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,690
you want to go by vintage now they've

613
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,220
actually started showing the vintage and

614
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,540
they'll tell you what you can do with it

615
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,370
this one is clear to run ads that means

616
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,930
it's going to cost you like ten times as

617
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:38,710
much

618
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,250
this one is this many years old and has

619
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,690
had you know they'll they'll actually

620
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,660
tell you it's like it's almost like

621
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,190
buying a like a pet or something where

622
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,690
they list all of the attributes of the

623
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,160
account what you're gonna get for your

624
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,380
money how likely it is that if you

625
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,270
perform a certain action it's going to

626
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,680
trigger something else they give you

627
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,870
guidelines into how to kind of slowly

628
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,720
morph it into being your identity so

629
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,000
this is actually not very hard to do the

630
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,440
platform's have tried to crack down you

631
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,850
won't find this necessarily on like

632
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,380
Fiverr anymore you'll have to go a

633
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,000
little bit deeper to find it but

634
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,110
actually interestingly if you go to

635
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,730
Instagram and you search fake accounts

636
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,050
or you search accounts or followers

637
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,720
you'll there's Instagram is like a funny

638
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,370
enough a message board for finding ways

639
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:24,160
to Instagram this is one

640
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,780
example of the community and filtration

641
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,460
piece so now you have your fake account

642
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,380
another slide I didn't show in this

643
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,940
particular case is you can also buy

644
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,980
engagement so even if you have the

645
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,540
accounts one of the things that you can

646
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,220
constantly do is buy engagement which

647
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,900
means that your tweets get liked your

648
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,360
Instagram posts get liked it's risky

649
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,220
sometimes because the platforms do look

650
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,550
for that but you can create a perception

651
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,350
that your account is popular or your

652
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,960
content is popular by buying engagement

653
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,350
this is the internet research agency BM

654
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,950
is a was a website called black matters

655
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,510
it was a website it was a Facebook

656
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,940
account on it was an Instagram I was it

657
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,720
had a SoundCloud

658
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,070
it was everywhere it had stickers it was

659
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,990
one of the examples sometimes when I do

660
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,150
a talk just on the internet research

661
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,560
agency this is one of the canonical

662
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,000
examples but what they're really doing

663
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,760
here as you can see is is there's a

664
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,830
there's a couple things happening first

665
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,750
the same way we saw in the Africa

666
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,610
operation that we just took down two

667
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:24,100
years later there's a recognition even

668
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,390
then that if you infiltrate the

669
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,640
community and get real people to serve

670
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,740
as your mouthpiece you no longer then

671
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,980
you have that one degree of

672
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,440
obscurity where instead of creating

673
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,870
content with your fake profile where

674
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,970
people might google you and try to

675
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,679
figure out you know who you are where

676
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,240
you came from and if you're even real

677
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,419
if you launder it through real people

678
00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:46,040
unwitting of course people this is where

679
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,590
you start to see that degree of

680
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:51,500
obfuscation that makes it very very hard

681
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,309
to find

682
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:54,110
once it's real people who are involved

683
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,240
the other real challenge is once real

684
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,770
people get involved if they don't know

685
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,410
who's been who's behind it

686
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,360
they are extremely aggrieved when their

687
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,280
stuff does come down and so as we have

688
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,530
seen in the Africa takedown the

689
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,960
resulting week has been people who are

690
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,120
tweeting saying why did my page come

691
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,280
down why didn't Facebook tell me what

692
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,100
was going on so the content comes down

693
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,960
and often times if you are a

694
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,370
particularly a social media manager

695
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,380
that's running one of these operations

696
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,240
that you're unwitting your other stuff

697
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,610
is all going to come down as well

698
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,990
because it's going to be seen as linked

699
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:30,590
to the broader operation but so this is

700
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,059
how the infiltration of community works

701
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:34,460
as we saw in the US they were remarkably

702
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,929
effective at this they were actually

703
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:38,360
sending money to activists to fund real

704
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,610
world protests they were paying people

705
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,980
to teach self-defense classes and local

706
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,679
neighborhoods to you know this was a

707
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,000
operation called

708
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,410
black fist which was trying to get get

709
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,429
the community thinking more about

710
00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:53,929
becoming more militant and its

711
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:56,120
opposition to police so there is this

712
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,130
again it's it's really described very

713
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,020
much as a social influence operation but

714
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,520
it's an extremely hybrid thing where

715
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,160
there are these infiltration tactics and

716
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,200
ways in which they're actively trying to

717
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,669
facilitate action in the real world

718
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,230
identify an opportunity space this is

719
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,120
Hong Kong these are the protests a

720
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,030
couple maybe a month back now there was

721
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,010
a moment in the Hong Kong protests this

722
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,960
is where this comes from where a police

723
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,360
officer shot a bean bag at a protester

724
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,520
and she lost her eye how many of you saw

725
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,030
that I'm curious on Twitter or elsewhere

726
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,860
okay so I'm like extremely online and I

727
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,150
saw it on Twitter almost immediately

728
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,610
after it happened but what happened next

729
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,030
was very interesting which was much the

730
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,890
same way as during the Iran protests

731
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,560
there was that woman named Neha who got

732
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,480
shot and she became a meme she became

733
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,500
the iconography of the protest movement

734
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,120
when you have that moment where

735
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,460
something becomes iconic like that and

736
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,500
all of these other people begin wearing

737
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,600
this mask over there I on solidarity and

738
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,400
literally becoming a creating

739
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,280
iconography around this moment you see

740
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,260
the state react at that point and so the

741
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,540
reaction was almost instantaneous the

742
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,550
china bots but some we call them are not

743
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,170
really bots they're actually operated by

744
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:12,220
humans but the the china cyborgs began

745
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,200
to come out of the woodwork to again

746
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,360
flood the zone and discredit the

747
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,250
narrative she had been shot by her own

748
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,560
people she was really a violent

749
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,780
protesters she hadn't been shot at all

750
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,820
again flood the zone make it impossible

751
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,860
to know what had actually happened and

752
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,350
this is a panic response this is not a

753
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:33,040
slow long game multi-year grow your

754
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,040
audience influence play this is a we are

755
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,160
responding to a to a moment in time in

756
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,960
which we have to retake control of the

757
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,430
narrative and barring that we have to

758
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,990
make it impossible for people to know

759
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,630
what's going on that action their

760
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,610
response to this actually did lead to

761
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,170
Facebook and Twitter

762
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,240
taking down a couple thousand accounts

763
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,980
and taking the remarkable step actually

764
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,860
of attributing them to PRC which is

765
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,090
something that we hadn't seen happen

766
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:01,990
before so producer appropriate content a

767
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,280
lot of people look at this and think

768
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,550
it's Russia this is actually Iran so one

769
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,900
of the things that we see is again the

770
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,060
recognition across multiple states that

771
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,800
this is a playbook that is effective

772
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,560
that this kind of memetic propaganda

773
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,020
works it resonates it spreads and so

774
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,340
this is where you see the production

775
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,470
sometimes the appropriation of content

776
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,510
Russia being much more sophisticated

777
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,190
than most of the others has just moved

778
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,050
into the able internet research agency

779
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,300
and say Russia but has moved into the

780
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,250
appropriation of content so they take

781
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,310
the most polarizing images from real

782
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,950
authentic media and they just amplify

783
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,510
them and that allows them to not

784
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,250
necessarily be discovered in the process

785
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,070
of creating new content it also creates

786
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,170
real challenges for the social platforms

787
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,850
around the question of what does it mean

788
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:46,720
to be authentic

789
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,870
when the content is coming from

790
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,400
hyperpolarized American media so again

791
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,720
what we're trying to say over and over

792
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,580
again as the issue of authenticity is

793
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,280
not a true

794
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,350
a narrative issue it's what is the voice

795
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,270
that's putting the content out what is

796
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,850
the dissemination pattern of the content

797
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,400
and in the last layer of analysis is

798
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,530
really what is the content because we're

799
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,390
constantly trying to avoid a perception

800
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:11,330
of takedowns based on you know political

801
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,660
or partisan issue

802
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,130
then there's the targeted dissemination

803
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,930
so you've created the content then you

804
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,420
spread it inside Syria Media Center this

805
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:23,810
is a GRU operation so again the internet

806
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,550
research agency is not the only thing

807
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,950
that runs these out of Russia this is

808
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,430
the GRU articles bias mongaul that a

809
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:34,070
sufi mongaul Sufi mongaul does not exist

810
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,860
and yet Sofie Mangal managed to place

811
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,380
her by lined content in something like

812
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,020
40 quote-unquote independent media

813
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,050
sources within the US so again the

814
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,630
creation of the persona moving not only

815
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,920
through the social space but also

816
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,000
through the narrative space this is one

817
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,870
of the there's a kind of computational

818
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,510
amplification there were a number of

819
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,310
these that happened in response again

820
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,320
much like the China Hong Kong response

821
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,740
when Jamal khashoggi was killed you saw

822
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,510
the the Saudi BOTS beginning to do the

823
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,740
same thing there was a lot more

824
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,570
automation there they were relatively

825
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,400
unsophisticated the networks were

826
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,650
largely taken down but there were a

827
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,080
number of hashtags one of the more

828
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,510
prominent ones was we all trust Mohammed

829
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,450
bin Salman and so again you see that

830
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,840
same type of using computational BOTS to

831
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,450
flood the zone in a moment of crisis to

832
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,670
kind of bolster in this case more of a

833
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:34,370
persuasive less about putting out 60

834
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,450
different narratives that they did that

835
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,090
to creating persuasion and then this is

836
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,100
what it looks like when it really when

837
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,460
when an operation crosses the chasm

838
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,890
missus Sean Hannity extremely prominent

839
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:52,060
I hesitate to say news polemicist on Fox

840
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,630
who who began to involve himself in the

841
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:00,890
cover-up story around the GRU hack and

842
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,340
leak operation very interestingly as I'm

843
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,990
sure you've all seen numerous times

844
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,930
there's the misattribution strategies

845
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,970
we see misattribution quite a bit in

846
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,730
influence operations where the GRU

847
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,800
response to the hack and leak operations

848
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,960
and the social influence operations was

849
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,820
to begin to put out the story that they

850
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,590
had not in fact hacked the DNC at all it

851
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,510
had been a leak the leak had come from

852
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,220
this murdered staffer named Seth rich

853
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,800
who was shot in a apparently unrelated

854
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,980
crime based on police reports but

855
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:36,620
because of that that haziness around who

856
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,970
had killed him and the fact that nobody

857
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,220
was ever found it was temporarily

858
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,260
convenient for them and so they and

859
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,060
WikiLeaks began to push out this

860
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,680
narrative that this young man had

861
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,720
actually been the leaker and then you

862
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,880
start to see that propaganda spread it's

863
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,310
trending on Twitter constantly hashtag

864
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,010
his name with Seth rich you see both

865
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:58,460
real authentic American both conspiracy

866
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,230
theorists and hyper partisans begin to

867
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,970
spread that narrative you see Russian

868
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,740
bot networks come in to amplify it and

869
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,180
then it makes its way all the way to

870
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,100
Hannity and he begins to run stories

871
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,490
about whether about Seth Seth rich as

872
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,740
the source of the leaked materials on

873
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,490
Fox News and there's actually an ongoing

874
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,530
lawsuit happening right now

875
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:20,330
his family is suing but this is what it

876
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:22,490
looks like when that sort of that social

877
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,230
propaganda that social influence

878
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,870
operation really crosses leaps in and

879
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:29,240
becomes national news and this is

880
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,310
exactly what you want because now a very

881
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,500
real percentage of American public

882
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,830
believes that the Russia hack was not

883
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,140
executed by Russia and that this that

884
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,620
this guy was responsible so now what so

885
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,730
now we have a sense of how these

886
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,380
campaigns work we have this idea of

887
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,650
staging this is the second was probably

888
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,320
even more ugly graphic this is how we're

889
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,420
trying to think about again that same

890
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,890
sort of what are the different what's

891
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,600
the matrix that we come up with if

892
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,850
creating operational resources is the

893
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,710
key what are ways that we can detect

894
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,270
that what are ways that we can deny them

895
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,650
the ability to do that what are ways

896
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,090
that we can disrupt the networks that

897
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,830
are in place so we're starting to try to

898
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,810
think and this is extremely rough in a

899
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,970
row right now but this is where some of

900
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,260
the work that we're doing now is

901
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,790
thinking much more about how do you

902
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,610
populate responses according to stages

903
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:19,900
and how do we think about this as a more

904
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,700
you know understanding the attack vector

905
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,840
with the goal of disrupting the

906
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,550
operation so recognizing adversarial

907
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,290
attack patterns and disinformation means

908
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,910
that we can design not only more

909
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,950
effective reactive strategies but we can

910
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,510
also be thinking about predictive

911
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,880
strategies and so now we have our corpus

912
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,480
of 53 events we can see again this every

913
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,430
time the platform's change the rules

914
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,260
whether that's a policy decision a new

915
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,480
feature a new entrant like I didn't have

916
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,130
tick tock up on my first slide right

917
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:54,080
there's any time new rules come into the

918
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,910
space what we're starting to do now is

919
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,100
read team out how can we think about how

920
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,430
those will each be incorporated into the

921
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,290
future operations that we'll be seeing

922
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,420
this is a thing that we care quite a bit

923
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,350
about you know we're in the middle of

924
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,179
our primary season right now in the US

925
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,830
and then we've got the 2020 election

926
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,480
coming up so instead of being you know

927
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,219
we don't want to be caught in the trap

928
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,980
of thinking about what happened in 2016

929
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,500
and expecting that same type of thing to

930
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,940
happen again we want to be thinking

931
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,090
about three years later with new policy

932
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,100
in place with new intelligence

933
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,199
organizations within each of the

934
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,639
platforms now have their own integrity

935
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,889
team that is looking for this stuff

936
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:32,989
actively we work with them at Stanford

937
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,699
on the Africa takedown we found some

938
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,199
part of the network they found some part

939
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,520
of the network we're trying to think

940
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,260
about really where do the capabilities

941
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,989
lie who can see what and when where do

942
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:43,880
the responsibilities lie how can we

943
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,320
create systems whereby people are

944
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,690
talking about this you know we have a

945
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,489
lot of connections now between civil

946
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:53,000
society government media and researchers

947
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,610
so that is all in place in a way that it

948
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,350
was not three years ago and that's why

949
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,940
we are able to achieve the kind of

950
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,440
takedowns of these networks that we are

951
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,380
today but one of the reasons I'm here is

952
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,350
actually just to think about what you

953
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,610
know what are other people saying in

954
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,710
other spaces that are adjacent and how

955
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,050
can we be thinking about sharing

956
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,110
information more effectively so I'm

957
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,510
going to go to questions I would say the

958
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,910
in summary you know influence operations

959
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,440
are here to stay this is not going

960
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,030
anywhere we don't think about it as

961
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,370
solving them or stopping them we think

962
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,170
about it as more of a management of a

963
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,410
chronic condition we think about it as

964
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:33,110
this is not a truth and narrative issue

965
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,330
it's about the exploitation and accord

966
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,790
attack on a social information ecosystem

967
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:40,250
how do we think about that and then the

968
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,480
last point is that when I just made

969
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,090
platforms industry government and and

970
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,620
other organizations have to be working

971
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,530
together to address the collective

972
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,210
vulnerabilities so I think we're going

973
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:52,550
to go to questions now and thank you

974
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,050
very much for listening

975
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,450

976
