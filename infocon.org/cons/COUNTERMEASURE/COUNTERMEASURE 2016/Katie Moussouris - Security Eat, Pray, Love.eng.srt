[Music]

2
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,439
part of what I'm coming here to talk to

3
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,460
you about today is a security journey

4
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,099
how many of you have heard of the book

5
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,168
or seen the movie Eat Pray Love right

6
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:34,270
yeah I had not seen the movie I barely

7
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:37,540
got through the book because you know it

8
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:40,000
seemed irrelevant to me even my chosen

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,160
profession but I realized that we're all

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,140
on some kind of a journey you know they

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,550
say with security security isn't a

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,340
destination it's a journey of you all

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,169
heard that one before so that book was

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,090
apparently about this one woman's

15
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,180
journey to kind of discover herself and

16
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:58,360
and and life and so I'm gonna take you

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:00,850
today through a very fast-forward tour

18
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:05,259
of my own security journey and hopefully

19
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:10,000
you'll find some useful things in it so

20
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:11,890
Who am I if the clicker works click yes

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,290
this is a word cloud of my Twitter

22
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,270
stream so you can kind of get a overall

23
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:19,299
impression of Who I am as a person and

24
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:21,158
what I care about yes apparently karaoke

25
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:24,009
is big on that list any of you know a

26
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:26,890
place tonight for karaoke okay great

27
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:28,749
talk to me later but these are the

28
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,520
things that I've done in my professional

29
00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:32,649
career and we're going to talk about a

30
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,798
few of them in my little security

31
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:38,920
journey with you today so first things

32
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:41,619
first in the whole Eat Pray Love

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,899
trifecta the eating is the part of her

34
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:45,969
life where she's kind of enjoying the

35
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:48,479
pleasures of the flesh right so she's

36
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:50,919
eating a lot she's having a lot of

37
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,950
relationships past her marriage and all

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,229
that stuff and the praying part is when

39
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,719
she gets spiritual and the love part is

40
00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:01,329
when she tries to balance it out so in

41
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,880
that in that same vein first of all

42
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:05,889
let's see so where did I start my career

43
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,380
in security I learned how to hack things

44
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:10,449
actually your opening keynote today

45
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,590
Tyler Shields and one of your other

46
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:14,880
keynotes who's sitting in the audience

47
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,709
Chris hang and I we all shared a common

48
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,329
hereditary hacker history that we were

49
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:20,290
all part of the artist formerly known as

50
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,030
at stake

51
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,290
does anyone remember at stake some of

52
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,660
you folks who were standing at the end

53
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,850
will definitely remember at stake so we

54
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,530
were among the first hackers for hire

55
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:33,040
who were actively

56
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:35,290
application layer security and that that

57
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,420
company was formed in 1999 I joined in

58
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:40,269
2003 after being an independent hacker

59
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,890
for hire for quite some time and the

60
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,140
title of this slide is where I learned

61
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,880
empathy so yes I was hacking in a pink

62
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,829
hoodie with a pink Hello Kitty TV that

63
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,130
was a video game hacking that I was

64
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,450
doing at that time professionally but it

65
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,600
was an interesting thing it was a gig

66
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,640
like no other in my penetration testing

67
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,220
career we were always looking for you

68
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,019
know all of the usual security issues

69
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,060
that you would find we were also looking

70
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,170
because it was gaming we were looking

71
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,090
for ways to steal credit card

72
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,700
information so all of that stuff that

73
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,720
you look for as a penetration tester but

74
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,519
this was the beginning of my

75
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,080
professional empathy and kind of

76
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,300
unlocked the doors for other things that

77
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,610
would follow the professional empathy I

78
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,200
developed on this particular gig was

79
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,360
profound because I you know was

80
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,010
listening all of the different typical

81
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,230
security vulnerabilities that we found

82
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,510
and they said yep yep yep but we've got

83
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,000
risk mitigation in place to deal with

84
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,769
that we've got risk mitigation in place

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,720
to deal with credit card fraud we've got

86
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:37,299
risk mitigation in place to deal with

87
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,920
all of these other types of breaches and

88
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:40,959
we're rolling out you know stronger

89
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,579
two-factor authentication momentarily it

90
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,280
took them 10 years but you know they

91
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,140
they felt like they had it handled in a

92
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,410
lot of the traditional security sense

93
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:52,089
what they didn't have a good sense of

94
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,859
was something that could actually end

95
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,530
their business and their investment in

96
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,930
this video game title and they wanted to

97
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,360
know all the ways in which we could

98
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,549
cheat that's what they hired us for they

99
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,590
hired us to cheat at video games boy was

100
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:06,940
this a really great gig I managed to set

101
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,620
this up at the front of the at stake

102
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,209
office just to rub it in everybody's

103
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,549
faces that I was playing video games for

104
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:14,049
a whole week but we were trying to cheat

105
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:16,478
because that was their business bottom

106
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:19,090
line and so while I was doing my usual

107
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,339
pen test gig this was the beginnings of

108
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:24,159
me understanding what business risk

109
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:26,530
meant as opposed to my traditional

110
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,060
myopic view of I can break in in the

111
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,950
following ways and this is why you

112
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,620
should pay attention to me because I am

113
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:34,390
the security expert and you are not

114
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,940
right I needed to pay attention to them

115
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:39,550
and figure out what it was they really

116
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:42,070
wanted and what it was that they were

117
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:45,160
really afraid of

118
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:47,320
so fast-forward you know I had also

119
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,640
taken a turn as a Linux developer in the

120
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,219
early part of my career so I knew what

121
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,770
it was like to ship some code right not

122
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,320
necessarily big production level

123
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:59,409
enterprise code but you know some Linux

124
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,450
code right so one of the things I knew

125
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,640
already and already had empathy for was

126
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,710
the fact that all software of a certain

127
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,719
size at least will contain security

128
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,820
vulnerabilities and then rather than get

129
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,730
kind of bogged down in the fact that

130
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,310
it's going to rain you know eventually I

131
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,290
started changing what my career focus

132
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,330
was so rather than breaking things and

133
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,850
even understanding which things I should

134
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,500
break and in what order to really

135
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,350
understand you know the business risk of

136
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,270
my clients I started thinking about well

137
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,730
how do I help them build more secure

138
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,229
software how do I help them stop making

139
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,200
the same coding mistakes over and over

140
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,940
that lead to me getting very bored on my

141
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,780
penetration test finding the same bugs

142
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:42,820
over and over right so I began to expand

143
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,080
and I thought okay well this I actually

144
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,060
pulled from Twitter today because

145
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,349
someone just had had to say it in a Venn

146
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,500
diagram and I thought this was great

147
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:53,560
it's there's no really easy solution

148
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:57,580
that contains all of this fast cheap

149
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,470
secure magical mojo so there's always a

150
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,219
dynamic right and you hear about this

151
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:04,270
all the time

152
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:06,490
security and functionality there's a

153
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,469
necessary trade-off of that we've gotten

154
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,330
much better at securing the

155
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,000
functionality that the users and

156
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:14,380
businesses actually need but we still

157
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,810
haven't adopted all of these great

158
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:19,150
security practices so in my own

159
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:22,300
evolution I thought well if I just

160
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:24,880
enable more people to find more bugs and

161
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,010
show how prevalent this is then you know

162
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,350
I'm not just one penetration tester you

163
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:32,050
know I can help help empower an entire

164
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:33,790
worldwide army of penetration testers

165
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,320
potentially some of you guys have heard

166
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,360
the word bug bounty you've mentioned a

167
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,390
few times right bug bounties y'all know

168
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,100
what they are okay so I started a couple

169
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:45,159
of research programs this was when I was

170
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,530
at Symantec when Symantec had had a bot

171
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,430
at stake and half of my friends went off

172
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:53,200
to form ISEC partners and I decided that

173
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,430
I was gonna stay and just do this one

174
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,430
thing that I thought was going to take a

175
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,990
month

176
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,420
that was create semantic vulnerability

177
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,270
research this was simply a means for us

178
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,800
existing hackers to publish our security

179
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,330
research and have a Volm disclosure

180
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,920
policy and I thought this is gonna be

181
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,280
dead simple we'll just use the at stake

182
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,050
full disclosure policy and we'll go

183
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,299
giant mega mega corporation taught me

184
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,100
differently right eventually I did

185
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,680
launch Symantec vulnerability research

186
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,910
and we did as a group find a whole lot

187
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,800
of vulnerabilities and third-party

188
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,510
products and report them but what I was

189
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,850
noticing was I thought it would be

190
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,890
easier to report vulnerabilities if we

191
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,990
were wearing the giant Symantec yellow

192
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,900
cape of saying we're a security company

193
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:36,350
and we're here to help but in fact we

194
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,330
got as much hostile you know hostile

195
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,920
reception from some of the vendors that

196
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,500
were unaware and unprepared of this

197
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,760
process as as we did when we were at

198
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,530
stake or as we did when we were

199
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,320
individual security researchers so

200
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:50,929
didn't actually change our reception in

201
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,159
the world definitely got threatening

202
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,170
phone calls threatening letters

203
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,460
cease-and-desist that kind of thing when

204
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,590
we were trying to report a security

205
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,349
vulnerability so then I thought okay

206
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:02,239
well you know what if being in one mega

207
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,040
corporation wasn't enough for me why

208
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,390
don't I join the biggest software

209
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,250
company in the world and so I joined

210
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:10,820
Microsoft as a security strategist and

211
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,830
it was there that I launched Microsoft's

212
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,560
first bug bounty programs and actually

213
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,930
wrote their very first coordinated

214
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,730
vulnerability disclosure policy they

215
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,220
didn't have one before that they were

216
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,990
pointing to a dead link that had been

217
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,300
sitting on the internet for a few years

218
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,010
from back in 2004 called the

219
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,690
organization for Internet safety some of

220
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,480
you folks who have been at this for a

221
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,760
long time do you remember oh is okay no

222
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,320
one but me that's good that's great so

223
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,150
that was what Microsoft was pointing to

224
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,600
before I wrote there Valdez closure

225
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:43,459
policy so here's a little bit of history

226
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,050
of own disclosure and bug bounty

227
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,420
programs this is a slide borrowed from

228
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,829
my friends at bugcrowd they are a bounty

229
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,290
service provider I'll talk about those

230
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,660
very very briefly later but essentially

231
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:55,730
you saw nothing new under the paying for

232
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,560
bugs paying for security bugs son for a

233
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:01,310
long time after Netscape had started

234
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,959
theirs and then in 2010 Google started a

235
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,119
bug bounty program for just their

236
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,130
browser and at that point I was at

237
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,630
Microsoft and my management said to me

238
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,180
Katie if we were to do a bug bounty

239
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,790
program what

240
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:14,250
that look like and so I embarked on what

241
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,920
eventually turn into a three-year

242
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:19,650
journey another journey where I was

243
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,449
looking for ways to implement this in

244
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,430
the biggest software company in the

245
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:27,090
world with over 800 supported products

246
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:29,550
many of them downlevel supported you

247
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:32,220
know of the same product and lots of

248
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:34,709
complexities right and it took three

249
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,390
years but eventually I did launch

250
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:39,420
Microsoft's first ever bug bounty

251
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,939
programs and up until Apple had

252
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:45,839
announced their program Microsoft's was

253
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:48,000
the biggest ongoing bug bounty program

254
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,760
that was not tied to an individual

255
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,190
contest in the world and that held for

256
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,110
about three years so big difference

257
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,510
between bug bounty programs and

258
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,940
vulnerability disclosure programs

259
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:03,420
does anybody know really what the

260
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,740
difference is gosh I tried to wake you

261
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,890
up oh wait there is somebody who will

262
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,690
say something yes oh you know the

263
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,030
difference okay he's not gonna say it

264
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,800
though okay I'll say it that's fine

265
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,630
the difference really is that

266
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,479
vulnerability disclosure itself is the

267
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:20,640
base practice of finding out about

268
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,800
potential vulnerabilities from somebody

269
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,050
else outside your organization and then

270
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,359
doing your best to investigate and fix

271
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:30,569
it whereas a bug bounty program is

272
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,300
simply an incentive that lays on top of

273
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:36,450
a primate primal vulnerability

274
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,430
disclosure program so we're going to

275
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:41,280
talk about that in a little bit but one

276
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:43,949
statistic that is really important in

277
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,500
our little InfoSec bubble we hear the

278
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:49,470
term bug bounty bandied around like it's

279
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,480
a common practice it is still in its

280
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,850
very early stages of what I call the

281
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,310
defense economy for vulnerabilities and

282
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,320
exploits we all know that you know bugs

283
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:01,229
of a certain type in certain products

284
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,140
can fetch huge sums of money exploits

285
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,480
that are fully functional even more sums

286
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,040
of money than an individual bug we've

287
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,750
known that for a very long time and that

288
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,000
economy is going has been going for

289
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,670
quite some time but the defense economy

290
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,810
for vulnerabilities is very very very

291
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:20,910
short-lived so far and most companies so

292
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:23,010
when you take the Forbes top 2,000 you

293
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:26,610
think companies with a lot of risk for

294
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:29,010
vention tons of security budget tons of

295
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,540
expertise in-house who are actually

296
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,370
trying to practice all of the best

297
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,010
practices following iso standards and

298
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:39,000
doing all that stuff and yet you see

299
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:41,160
that 94% of them have no public way to

300
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,890
report a vulnerability to them that

301
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,260
would imply that the majority of that

302
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,970
94% don't even have a secret way to

303
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,430
report a vulnerability to them so they

304
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,840
have no Valen to Scotia process so when

305
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,000
people bandy about the term of bug

306
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,770
bounties are really catching on I would

307
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,990
love for that to be true but as it's

308
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,340
just a subset of vulnerability to

309
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,310
disclosure and vulnerability disclosure

310
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:05,160
itself has not been that broadly adopted

311
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:07,560
as an industry practice I will beg to

312
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,660
differ that the data outside of our

313
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:16,079
InfoSec bubble tells us something very

314
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:18,270
very different so okay clicker right so

315
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,560
I've heard this a lot where people will

316
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,050
say that bug bounties could replace

317
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,630
penetration testing that's just not true

318
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:27,209
it's there are differences in what you

319
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,220
get differences in how you can structure

320
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:31,260
these things but essentially you will

321
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,030
always still need to do professional

322
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,370
penetration testing especially for

323
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:37,890
things that you can't necessarily easily

324
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,840
crowdsource I heard a bunch of IOT talk

325
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,600
this morning or the early this afternoon

326
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:46,020
and in fact that industry it's quite

327
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,030
difficult to do consistent public bug

328
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,860
bounties you can do hybrid things which

329
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,930
is a hybrid between a penetration test

330
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:55,140
and a bug mounting a crowdsourced

331
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:57,390
type of look at your security but it's

332
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:03,150
going to be very different in terms of

333
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:04,620
dynamic so quick overview not going to

334
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,970
spend too much time on this but in north

335
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,620
america there are three main bounty

336
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,620
service providers and i work with all of

337
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,930
them their differences right now they're

338
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,240
converging a lot of their services but

339
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:17,010
at this moment this is what they sort of

340
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,560
look like and what they can give to an

341
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,420
organization right so the easy button

342
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,819
for triage how many people are familiar

343
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:26,099
with the term triage I found this out in

344
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,900
some other conference I spoke at that

345
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,400
was a security conference that somebody

346
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,020
asked me what did you mean you kept

347
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,130
saying triage and I was like oh boy I

348
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,920
should ask next time

349
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,689
so triage is essentially ascertaining

350
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,069
whether or not something is a bug house

351
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,750
here it is and in the case of a bug

352
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:42,120
bounty program how much did you pay out

353
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:44,070
that's roughly and what order you might

354
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,170
fix it in say you have all critical

355
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,820
vulnerabilities coming in what order how

356
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,829
do you prioritize fixing them when

357
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,440
they're all doomsday right so that's

358
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:55,680
triage hacker one where I used to work

359
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,720
has a platform for power users so if you

360
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,359
have the staff and the in-house know-how

361
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,580
or the play books already written on how

362
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,830
to do triage appropriately and

363
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,590
consistently for example and you have a

364
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:09,090
large volume of incoming reports there's

365
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,680
a lot of automation built into that

366
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,140
platform that's meant for the power user

367
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,089
that's great if you want your security

368
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,790
staff actually spending time doing

369
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:19,890
triage some people do it because they're

370
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:23,579
sensitive about whose eyes actually get

371
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:26,250
to see your bugs even a service like

372
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:28,350
that is unacceptable to a lot of vendors

373
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,690
with long times to fix like Microsoft

374
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,400
and Apple where yes they might love the

375
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,680
tools that definitely give them an

376
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,020
advantage over email but no absolutely

377
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,030
not do they want anyone else to see

378
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:41,850
their bugs and nor do they want to house

379
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:43,920
their bugs in a cloud service so there

380
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,690
are still drawbacks I'm in cynic I call

381
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,479
them adult pentest friend finder they

382
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:50,430
are basically okay three of you know

383
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,050
what I was talking about Adult Friend

384
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,819
Finder is a some kind of a naughty

385
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:58,650
dating site that I've heard of and never

386
00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:00,750
ever gone to visit so that is syn/ack

387
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:03,420
and in a nutshell their adult pentest

388
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:05,460
friend finder they're basically a you

389
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:08,219
know a clearinghouse for individual more

390
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,740
highly vetted security researchers who

391
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,600
may participate in a crowdsource model

392
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,430
but it's much more controlled and much

393
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,860
closer to your traditional penetration

394
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:19,170
test there may be legal agreements that

395
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,910
they sign similar to someone doing a

396
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:23,729
traditional penetration test so there's

397
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:26,670
a broad spectrum of assistance that's

398
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:30,839
out there but what about all of the

399
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:33,900
basics on the back end right so let's

400
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:38,130
see first of all let's go through a

401
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:40,709
really quick case study of Microsoft's

402
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,480
first ever bug bounty programs and then

403
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,550
the evolution of that into the

404
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,980
first-ever United States government bug

405
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:50,490
bounty programs all of which I've had a

406
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:54,180
hand in fortunately or unfortunately

407
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,900
so remember I said that I was asked in

408
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,640
2010

409
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,980
what would a Microsoft bug bounty

410
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,990
program look like well after three years

411
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,450
and being told not just by my management

412
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,860
team but also having executives publicly

413
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,480
quoted saying they would never pay

414
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,780
hackers money for vulnerabilities I

415
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,570
launched those so those were Microsoft's

416
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:14,310
very first bug bounty programs there's a

417
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,920
few key differences here traditional bug

418
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:19,650
bounty programs are one bug one bounty

419
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:22,560
to a single finder of the vulnerability

420
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:24,540
what we did here was we did $100,000 for

421
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,300
brand new exploitation techniques how

422
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,849
many of you are familiar with ASLR def

423
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,040
all of the different mitigation options

424
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:34,080
that are available across many platforms

425
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,599
not just Microsoft right so these are

426
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,520
things that make it harder to exploit an

427
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,680
individual vulnerability harder to write

428
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,350
an exploit and make those exploits less

429
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,930
reliable so return oriented programming

430
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:48,150
or JIT spray are examples of mitigation

431
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:50,640
bypasses if you heard those words before

432
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,810
I'm just now I'm mesmerizing it with my

433
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,540
alphabet soup okay

434
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:57,390
so anyway take it for granted that these

435
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,370
are exploitation techniques that defeat

436
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,560
all of the protective countermeasures on

437
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:05,730
the system that are available at a given

438
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:07,800
time so we were paying $100,000 for a

439
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,620
new technique that could bypass all of

440
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,629
those protective countermeasures so we

441
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,189
were told that that wasn't enough but

442
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,660
there's no way that somebody who had

443
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,130
something not valuable would ever give

444
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,450
it up for a mere hundred thousand

445
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:24,780
dollars we were also told that $11,000

446
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:26,670
for an ie 11 vulnerability a critical

447
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,980
vulnerability 9/11 was also not enough

448
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,110
how many of you have heard of six-figure

449
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,570
payouts for vulnerabilities and the

450
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:36,060
latest browsers some of you have

451
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:39,960
definitely heard this okay yes thank you

452
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:41,190
at least one of you all right so um so

453
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,300
we were told that none of this was going

454
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:45,020
to work that no one was going to come

455
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:48,480
forward and this is a place where

456
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:50,520
people's common sense was actually

457
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,720
telling them the wrong thing because

458
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,370
what they were missing was this

459
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,740
essential piece of data which I knew

460
00:17:53,370 --> 00:18:00,810
which was that for no money at all over

461
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,610
200,000 non-spam email messages a year

462
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,020
were coming in to secure at Microsoft

463
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,909
these were all true

464
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,310
stick hackers who wanted to improve the

465
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:11,130
security of the world by telling

466
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:12,450
Microsoft for free about potential

467
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,690
vulnerabilities now not all of them

468
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:17,400
turned out to be real vulnerabilities

469
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:20,460
but the important thing is we already

470
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,610
had a pool of willing eyes some of whom

471
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,140
were actually capable and willing

472
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:27,300
reporting in for free so what we were

473
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:31,530
really doing was we were looking for

474
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:34,590
ways to align the market realities with

475
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:36,480
what Microsoft actually needed so again

476
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:39,990
it was that empathy that I had grown

477
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,780
somewhere in a pink hoodie on a pen test

478
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,370
way back where it changed my view of

479
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,500
understanding that this wasn't just

480
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:49,709
about getting hackers paid which I loved

481
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,510
that it was about aligning Microsoft's

482
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:55,550
engineering goals and the hacker

483
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:59,580
community for better defense so here

484
00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:02,040
there we go here is the slide the exact

485
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,810
slide not with that stuff on the side

486
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,629
but the exact slide that I use to

487
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:09,060
convince Internet Explorer's management

488
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,340
to not only launch the very first bug

489
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,350
bounty at Microsoft but to pay for their

490
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,260
own bugs which was very important so

491
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:19,379
what you were looking at is real data

492
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:21,120
and a projection so the real data is in

493
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,610
blue and these were how many

494
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,219
vulnerability reports we were see we

495
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:28,530
received during the beta period of IE 10

496
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,470
that's that low blue line then there's a

497
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:34,340
break then there's a big spike does

498
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:37,980
anyone want to guess what that break was

499
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:40,199
release correct thank you it was it was

500
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,180
what's called RTM released to

501
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,760
manufacturing the code was out of beta

502
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:47,300
and it was ready to be final and then

503
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,560
suddenly those altruistic hackers who at

504
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,780
200,000 email messages a year were

505
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,790
coming forward to tell Microsoft they

506
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:56,160
would come forward all at once after

507
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:58,500
beta was over why because the only

508
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,170
incentive that they had was the hope

509
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,970
that maybe they'd get their name 10

510
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:06,270
point Arial font spelled out in a

511
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:08,160
Microsoft Bulletin betas typically you

512
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:10,889
don't get a bulletin for a beta bug fix

513
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,470
so we had inadvertently been incenting

514
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,270
this group of altruistic hackers to hold

515
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,640
onto their bugs till the worst possible

516
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:19,920
time worst possible time

517
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,270
so this was the slide and I had 12

518
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,010
slides as you're always supposed to have

519
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,510
12 slides when you talk to executives

520
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,610
I've been told twelve slides

521
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,770
this was slide number two and he said

522
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:30,840
yes yes yes I'm gonna make it easy for

523
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:33,059
you how much that was literally how that

524
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,290
happened he said right so you want to

525
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,790
put some money at the beginning of the

526
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:37,440
beta period you're gonna traffic shape

527
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:41,010
and you're gonna move the spike I'm in

528
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,600
how much and that was that that was the

529
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,660
birth of Microsoft's bug bounty programs

530
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,490
now how did this evolve into the

531
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,080
Pentagon hack the Pentagon any of you

532
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,750
heard of this thing happened this summer

533
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,820
yes so when I was still at Microsoft I

534
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:56,850
had given a guest lecture at Harvard and

535
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:59,639
MIT s little joint you know his school

536
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:01,678
policy school thing and somebody from

537
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,390
the Pentagon was there and invited me to

538
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,610
brief the Pentagon because they had

539
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,559
heard of these bug bounty things but

540
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:10,110
they thought this is gonna be completely

541
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:12,210
infeasible there is no way to control

542
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:14,280
this hacker world and there no no no no

543
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:16,350
no we're not going to invite hackers to

544
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,668
hack us that's crazy we're definitely

545
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,049
not going to call it hack the Pentagon

546
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:21,750
out of the question

547
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:23,070
not gonna happen well anyway so there

548
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:26,669
are a lot of really great people at the

549
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:28,830
Pentagon who pushed this rock uphill but

550
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:30,870
what they did was they needed somebody

551
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,760
who had come before who had answered all

552
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:34,709
the lawyer's questions who had figured

553
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,840
out the economic models the game theory

554
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,820
all of that stuff and constructed

555
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,220
something that ended up being the very

556
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:43,590
first successful pilot called hack the

557
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,049
Pentagon so we were wondering if hackers

558
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:49,590
would show up if they would actually

559
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:51,270
register and participate because the

560
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,980
requirement was you to pre-register and

561
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:55,250
you had to be willing to go through some

562
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,179
kind of preliminary background check I

563
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,830
reporters when they were asking me about

564
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:00,960
it at the launch said okay so they're

565
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:04,799
all gonna be drug tested I said oh no we

566
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:08,280
want participants we want them we want

567
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,620
the hackers to come forward no none of

568
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,120
that but what actually what actually

569
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,649
they needed to do was they didn't need

570
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,020
to be US citizens they just needed to

571
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:18,150
have a US taxpayer ID so they could be

572
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,710
foreign but authorized to work in the

573
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,240
United States and just you know

574
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,520
essentially turn over a social security

575
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,770
number a taxpayer ID and then if they

576
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,320
found a bug that was gonna get a bounty

577
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:29,760
then they would get a criminal

578
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,389
background check and the reason for that

579
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,119
was the federal government in the

580
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:36,248
very risky first program did not want to

581
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:38,499
pay taxpayer money to convicted felons

582
00:22:36,249 --> 00:22:40,959
that's their choice okay then I know

583
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:43,659
some really nice felons really really

584
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:46,419
great great folks really good at hacking

585
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:48,700
too but the point was for a pilot to be

586
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:50,320
successful they gave me you know a few

587
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,239
criteria the most important of which

588
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,950
that I took to heart was don't make us

589
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:57,519
look like chumps don't make us look like

590
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:59,859
chumps and so this this is this is not

591
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:02,799
chump at all this is actually pretty

592
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:05,678
good over we were hoping for 500 hackers

593
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:08,379
over 1,400 came forward and that was

594
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,539
just an indication of how much they were

595
00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:11,889
excited for the very first time not only

596
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:14,109
would the US government pay them a

597
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:16,149
little cash but for the first time they

598
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:17,649
were being invited to tell the US

599
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:19,689
government at least a small part of it

600
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:23,468
about vulnerabilities they found but

601
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:25,539
were afraid to report for fear of legal

602
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:27,729
repercussions drones from the sky you

603
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:30,729
name it they were afraid of it I almost

604
00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:34,419
sent tinfoil to many of my friends after

605
00:23:30,729 --> 00:23:36,700
this was announced almost came real

606
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:38,559
close until I did point out that by the

607
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,759
way if you're worried about giving the

608
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,009
government your social security number

609
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:47,159
they gave you that number

610
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:50,469
they know who you are already anyway so

611
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:53,709
138 vulnerability reports in about 22

612
00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:56,200
days the first report coming in 13

613
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:57,729
minutes past midnight note to self do

614
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,249
not launch these things at midnight do

615
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:05,159
not do because the hackers will be fast

616
00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:07,570
so then what happened last Friday

617
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:09,999
seriously okay there we go last Friday I

618
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:12,809
was in Austin Texas and that is

619
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:15,249
secretary Fanning of the army who

620
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:16,989
simultaneously announced hack the army

621
00:24:15,249 --> 00:24:19,329
which is the next iteration of these

622
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:21,809
government hacking programs where it is

623
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:24,629
not only legal but you will get paid

624
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:27,249
announced this at the same time as

625
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:28,869
awkwardly for us announcing that he was

626
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:30,999
planning to leave because of the current

627
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:33,458
administration he is the first openly

628
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:36,190
gay you know secretary of the army to

629
00:24:33,459 --> 00:24:38,109
serve and anyway

630
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,539
hack the Army is happening at least

631
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:42,099
there's that right and this challenge

632
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:45,220
will go off before the inauguration in

633
00:24:42,099 --> 00:24:49,519
case you're wondering so

634
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:51,889
so anyway what so what did this teach me

635
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:54,139
about bug bounties and and everything it

636
00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:56,240
was not that there's one-size-fits-all

637
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:57,979
and whatnot and most of the people who

638
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,720
come to me for bug bounty advice I end

639
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,669
up talking them out of it I end up

640
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,860
talking them out of it because to me

641
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:07,039
it's much more important to have that

642
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:09,469
foundational layer on your journey you

643
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,769
know of dealing with vulnerability

644
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:16,580
reports at all before you embark upon

645
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:18,889
something as rigorous and will stretch

646
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:21,230
all of your operational capabilities if

647
00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:24,080
not done properly of starting a bug

648
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:26,090
bounty program I don't run marathons my

649
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,279
brother does I'm more of a mathlete in

650
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,840
the family but he tells me that you know

651
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:31,700
if you want to run a marathon and you

652
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,639
really have to train for it and I apply

653
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:37,999
the same principles to doing anything

654
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:40,129
that accelerates how much how many

655
00:25:37,999 --> 00:25:41,929
vulnerabilities are reported to you so

656
00:25:40,129 --> 00:25:43,248
whether that's starting a new vonda's

657
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:45,919
closure program when you've had nothing

658
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:47,809
or it's kicking it into the next level

659
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,490
of starting with certain types of bug

660
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:52,759
bounty programs whether they're private

661
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:54,619
or public or you know some variation

662
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,450
like adult pentest friend finder like I

663
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:58,610
was saying you know the private fully

664
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,889
vetted characters who are in your bounty

665
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:03,918
pool all of that stuff you still need to

666
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:05,809
train and then the fact of the matter is

667
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,249
a lot of organizations and a lot of

668
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:09,820
different verticals outside the

669
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:11,929
technology sector banking healthcare

670
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,700
automotive industry other kinds of

671
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:16,220
manufacturing medical device they all

672
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,679
say no no no no no but we're special and

673
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,840
here's why we're so special and I say

674
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,340
you are special except that you're not

675
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:26,119
when it comes to vulnerability

676
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:27,320
disclosure and honestly we have seen

677
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:31,009
already

678
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:34,340
you know the deployment of patches in in

679
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:36,499
sort of an IOT early IOT environment and

680
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,629
that's with our mobile devices right I

681
00:26:36,499 --> 00:26:40,419
remember the early days when Microsoft

682
00:26:38,629 --> 00:26:43,389
was trying to put the Windows Update

683
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:45,409
client on the device and then

684
00:26:43,389 --> 00:26:47,719
negotiating with the phone carriers

685
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:50,360
negotiating essentially all up and down

686
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,330
their entire ecosystem of their supply

687
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:56,840
chain for this one thing right this one

688
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:57,799
device we've barely been scratching the

689
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,499
surface

690
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:02,470
on how to deploy updates even once you

691
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:05,960
have all of this vulnerability

692
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:08,480
capability handling in place let alone

693
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:12,350
how do you get all of those fixes out

694
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:14,200
into the wild okay so now it's time to

695
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:17,389
pray

696
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,669
we will pray so one of the things that I

697
00:27:17,389 --> 00:27:22,369
stopped doing when I stopped being a

698
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:24,860
traditional penetration tester wasn't

699
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:27,289
just to try and expand and allow more

700
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:29,959
people to eat at this feast of a table

701
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:31,700
of bugs right as I did with starting

702
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,710
those volunteers and those bug bounty

703
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:36,919
programs one thing I did was I realized

704
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:40,009
that there were standards being written

705
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:42,230
by people who weren't practitioners of

706
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:44,899
these vulnerability disclosure and

707
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,669
whatnot and so Microsoft had asked me

708
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:48,018
hey Katie

709
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:50,480
this always starts with them hey Katie

710
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:53,570
can you look into and what happened was

711
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,190
it was looking into the ISO standards

712
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:57,230
for vulnerability disclosure how many of

713
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:59,019
you heard about them they were actually

714
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:02,899
started by the Canadian national body

715
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:05,899
anyway they're the ISO standards for

716
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:07,459
vulnerability disclosure are 29 147 I'll

717
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:10,758
mention them a little bit later in the

718
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:12,649
slides but that was originally I was

719
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:15,169
sent to basically investigate what's

720
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:18,018
going on and just make sure that it does

721
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:19,460
no harm and I said do you realize that I

722
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:21,109
used to hack things for a living before

723
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,580
you guys got your hands on me and now

724
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:23,928
you want me to go be a standards wonk

725
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:27,168
and they said yes please please go do

726
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:30,259
that and so for the last almost nine

727
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:32,269
years it's amazing I have been working

728
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:34,879
on ISO standards and then steadily

729
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:39,350
creeping in some more and more policy

730
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:42,109
realms okay so this is me a couple weeks

731
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:44,480
ago in Abu Dhabi this was three hours

732
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:46,879
that I had left over at the end of

733
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,159
basically 12-hour days editing ISO

734
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:51,019
standards so everyone says to me oh you

735
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:52,669
get to go to the neatest places and do

736
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:55,340
the coolest things and I'm telling you

737
00:28:52,669 --> 00:28:57,919
this image represents three hours of

738
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,658
free time during a week that otherwise I

739
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,149
was spent in windows windowless

740
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:04,730
conference rooms arguing with old men

741
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:07,008
mostly old men about the placement of a

742
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:11,019
- so go ahead and be jealous

743
00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:11,019
jealousy right there yes

744
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:18,240
so oh come on super slides yes okay this

745
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,389
is the other thing that I've done to

746
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,910
myself in my strange evolution in old

747
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:27,720
age so as I've gotten more and more part

748
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:30,660
of the overall policy and regulatory

749
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,120
global regulatory regime I've decided

750
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,650
that you know one I'm gonna dye my hair

751
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,620
whatever the hell color I feel like

752
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:39,420
number one number two that occasionally

753
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,429
I'll open up a keynote with a live

754
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,380
karaoke performance with backup dancers

755
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,210
and they also had fire this was key week

756
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:47,580
on last year and the title of my talk

757
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:49,470
was swinging from the cyber Lear how to

758
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,000
navigate you know cyber regulations

759
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:52,380
without dying or something like that but

760
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,240
essentially I opened up with a musical

761
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,760
number unfortunately they did not have

762
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,530
the harnesses here nor the pyro nor the

763
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,550
dancers nor am i crazy enough to do this

764
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:03,750
again

765
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:05,879
but I did this and then I talked about

766
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,870
the boss in our arrangement how many of

767
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:11,700
you have heard about the boss in our

768
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:14,129
arrangement okay great so yeah this dark

769
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,720
photo I blame Dave Attell for the

770
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:17,910
darkness of the photo but all that says

771
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,590
in that sign that you can't read and the

772
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:20,700
junk there is that it was a construction

773
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:22,919
site right in front of the Commerce

774
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,720
Department and those of us in the United

775
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,070
States who were trying to deal with the

776
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,200
bus and our arrangement from an industry

777
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:30,540
perspective we're navigating over this

778
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,610
rubble rocky road right into the

779
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:35,220
Commerce Department and trying to give

780
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:37,580
our expert witness testimony to the

781
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,560
folks who were then going back and

782
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:44,250
potentially renegotiating the boss in

783
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:46,649
our arrangement so what is it whoo all

784
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:48,840
right what it is for those of you who

785
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:50,370
are not familiar it is 41 countries

786
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,879
originally designed as a

787
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:56,879
non-proliferation treaty a voluntary

788
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,010
treaty really about trying to control

789
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,260
the exports of things like nuclear

790
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,760
weapons were the components or the

791
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:08,160
technology to make nuclear weapons

792
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:11,220
similar type of weaponry in 2013 they

793
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:15,330
added some different sections that

794
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:17,820
govern our space cybersecurity so in the

795
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:19,889
41 countries only the united states had

796
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,230
been the last of the holdouts who hadn't

797
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:24,630
implemented their own domestic export

798
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:26,340
control rules too

799
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:31,470
form with this agreement the agreement

800
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:33,389
went into place in December 2013 I don't

801
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,950
think I mentioned the timing of when I

802
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:37,320
launched Microsoft's first ever bug

803
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:41,610
bounty programs but that was June of

804
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:43,679
2013 I've been told by my wonderful

805
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:45,120
Microsoft legal counsel who still works

806
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,280
there and I'm still really good friends

807
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,739
with that had the bus in our arrangement

808
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,070
been passed at that time I would not

809
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:54,990
have been able to launch those programs

810
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:56,610
now I didn't tell you the frequency by

811
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:58,650
which we were learning about new

812
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:00,510
mitigation bypass techniques before

813
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:02,520
those bounties before that hundred

814
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:04,860
thousand dollar bounty it was roughly

815
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,750
once every three years and those are the

816
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,399
types of issues that you can't fix on a

817
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:10,740
Patch Tuesday you have to reaaargh

818
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,450
attacked some of the basic levels of the

819
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:15,000
platform so learning about them after

820
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:17,100
they're already public and out three

821
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,770
about three years you know between

822
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:23,010
learning about every one we change that

823
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:25,320
to that bounty has been paid out I

824
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:27,870
believe over five times in the last

825
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,939
three years and that means that people

826
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:33,600
are coming forward they are willing to

827
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:35,190
pay or willing to to license their

828
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,530
technology they're not selling it to

829
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:39,510
Microsoft for $100,000 but it's an open

830
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:41,250
license in exchange for a hundred

831
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:43,740
thousand dollars of their brand-new

832
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,540
mitigation bypass techniques the problem

833
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:48,900
with the vas in our arrangement is that

834
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:52,490
it regulates the export of those

835
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:55,320
techniques among other things it added

836
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:57,810
let's see sir intrusion software and

837
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,760
intrusion software technology I won't

838
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:01,909
put you to sleep completely by quoting

839
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,830
like which subsections of this thing

840
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:07,980
deal with those but suffice it to say

841
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:10,139
that the technology transfer elements of

842
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:12,870
the vas in our arrangement stood to

843
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,970
basically cease all vulnerability

844
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:18,239
disclosure type of exchanges of

845
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:20,340
information across borders because you

846
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,440
wouldn't know until you actually did

847
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:24,540
your triage whether or not you've

848
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,120
actually committed or somebody else

849
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:29,070
committed an export violation right and

850
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,659
asking for license isn't applying for

851
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:32,610
licenses each time was going to bind

852
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,380
everything to a halt as well so that's

853
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:36,750
the Volm disclosure part think about the

854
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,820
cyber security incident response part if

855
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,820
you're passing

856
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:43,369
command and control software for the

857
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:46,129
latest and greatest botnet you are

858
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:48,320
potentially in violation of export

859
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:51,019
agreements that went into effect around

860
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:54,499
2013 who knew who knew did anyone know

861
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:56,960
no so what a bunch of us tried to do was

862
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:59,779
point out that the practical the

863
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,090
practical application of these controls

864
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:04,519
was not actually conducive to security

865
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:06,918
and I and it came from a good place they

866
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:08,210
were trying to limit the propagation of

867
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:10,760
some of these things that could affect

868
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:12,949
human rights if they got you know into

869
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,960
the hands of nation-states that would

870
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:17,058
use them to surveil their own people or

871
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,918
dissidents or journalists in foreign

872
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:22,069
countries these were all ways in which

873
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:24,649
this category of software had been used

874
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:29,409
and why they actually added these to the

875
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:35,598
export controls okay that's great stuff

876
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:36,649
however so of course they meant well the

877
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:41,599
road to hell is paved with good

878
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:42,980
intentions so last year the United

879
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,309
States Commerce Department basically

880
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:50,149
said you know we are going to put out a

881
00:34:46,309 --> 00:34:52,099
draft export control rule and we are

882
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:55,339
going to ask the industry to give

883
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:58,040
commentary they received I believe

884
00:34:55,339 --> 00:35:00,470
somewhere north of 260 different

885
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,210
comments some of which were obvious

886
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:03,759
trolls you know saying that we support

887
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,630
this and we hope that it you know

888
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,579
engenders the overthrow of the United

889
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:10,369
States government you know stuff like

890
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:13,280
that but some stuff was was actionable

891
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:14,540
and was real similar to some of those

892
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,790
statements that I was just saying about

893
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:19,700
how it interferes with common defensive

894
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:22,069
activities in real time and at that

895
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:24,319
point about a year ago I thought for

896
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:26,240
sure the State Department is just

897
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:27,829
waiting for me to leave the country and

898
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,848
then when I hear that noise that drones

899
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:33,980
for me oh my god after me earlier this

900
00:35:31,849 --> 00:35:37,089
year in June I got an email from the

901
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:39,859
State Department saying Katie we've

902
00:35:37,089 --> 00:35:41,720
we're going back to the experts meeting

903
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:43,880
at Boston are and we would like for you

904
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,118
to join the official US delegation to

905
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:49,970
renegotiate this arms control deal and I

906
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,559
was like sure I would love to do that

907
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:53,689
because I have just launched

908
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:56,089
my own company a month ago and I would

909
00:35:53,689 --> 00:35:58,038
love to stop everything and yes of

910
00:35:56,089 --> 00:36:00,199
course I went so of course I went so

911
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:01,640
that was the first of two experts

912
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:03,939
meetings that I have been privileged to

913
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:07,058
attend on behalf of the United States in

914
00:36:03,939 --> 00:36:11,089
renegotiating this arms-control deal

915
00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:14,479
quite a strange leap from the pink

916
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:17,209
hoodie you know hacking these video

917
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:19,069
games and literally sending console

918
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:23,118
messages to the beta players saying

919
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:24,680
Hello Kitty owns you to being asked to

920
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,339
renegotiate an international arms

921
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:29,689
control deal sure I love that but this

922
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:31,699
has been a strange journey and I

923
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:34,009
wouldn't I wouldn't be telling you I

924
00:36:31,699 --> 00:36:37,400
wouldn't be telling you this journey if

925
00:36:34,009 --> 00:36:39,859
it didn't resonate for me as as sort of

926
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:45,109
my overall evolution of how I look at

927
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:47,989
security as a whole so remember how I

928
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:49,788
said $100,000 right that that originally

929
00:36:47,989 --> 00:36:53,119
was thought to not be enough

930
00:36:49,789 --> 00:36:53,599
the first recipient name is James for

931
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,599
Shaw

932
00:36:53,599 --> 00:37:00,170
he's British he lives in in England one

933
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:02,059
of the 41 of us in our countries and he

934
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:05,449
submitted the very first qualifying

935
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:07,069
mitigation bypass technique and then of

936
00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:09,289
course you know when I called him to let

937
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:11,479
him know he was gonna be invited to the

938
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:13,160
blue hat conference which was is still

939
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:15,859
running there it was started by window

940
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:17,538
Snyder back in 2004 I think at Microsoft

941
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:19,038
and it's their own internal hacker

942
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:22,249
conference where they invite hackers

943
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:24,709
from the outside to give talks and

944
00:37:22,249 --> 00:37:26,419
demonstrations to the developers and the

945
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,919
executives to basically scare the

946
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:30,890
bejesus out of them into doing better

947
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,949
with security right and he said to me

948
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:36,229
he's like Katie I I picture you handing

949
00:37:33,949 --> 00:37:38,900
me a giant check on stage do how I do a

950
00:37:36,229 --> 00:37:41,448
terrible James impersonation he's heard

951
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:43,819
it so many times at this point but he

952
00:37:41,449 --> 00:37:45,529
expected a giant check and so I

953
00:37:43,819 --> 00:37:46,969
immediately contacted the marketing

954
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:48,890
people and I said James wants James

955
00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:52,819
wants a giant check yep get him a giant

956
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:57,410
check and and there it was we had our

957
00:37:52,819 --> 00:38:00,199
very first and in fact our last coming

958
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:02,749
from one of the boss in our countries so

959
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:04,850
the rest of the recipients of this

960
00:38:02,749 --> 00:38:06,319
particular reward

961
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:08,600
we're either already in the United

962
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,660
States and giving it to a US company so

963
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:16,040
there's no export there or they came

964
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:19,069
from China so the real effects even

965
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,270
though this export control has not been

966
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:23,240
implemented in the United States the

967
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:25,820
real effects on the potential of I mean

968
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:28,700
there's that what is that FOMO fear of

969
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:31,040
missing out we are missing out we are

970
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:33,049
absolutely missing out on the global

971
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,460
defenders who are potentially able to

972
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:37,640
come up with these new mitigation

973
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:40,280
bypasses that a vendor like Microsoft or

974
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:42,830
any vendor that makes a complex product

975
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,560
with a big supply chain has to be able

976
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:48,770
to deal with with as much lead time as

977
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:51,529
possible so yes it worked yes it

978
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:53,840
continues to work but we are observing a

979
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:55,870
change in a shaping of who is

980
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:58,430
participating in this defense

981
00:38:55,870 --> 00:39:01,549
vulnerability and exploit economy that

982
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:03,109
is brand-new as it's being potentially

983
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:08,380
regulated out of existence by

984
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:11,930
well-meaning people so yes they are

985
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:13,760
right now and I I didn't show up until

986
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:16,970
early afternoon today because I was in

987
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,700
my room still working with some of the

988
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:22,459
Wassenaar countries remotely not you

989
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:24,799
guys Canada's cool you guys are cool but

990
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,690
there are some other countries that have

991
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,610
not yet approved some of the changes

992
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:31,550
that we wrote in during those two

993
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:34,070
meetings that we had in Vienna over this

994
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:38,090
last year they still haven't approved

995
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:40,070
them and what I fear today now that

996
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:41,510
we've had that election is we don't

997
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:43,880
actually know from a cybersecurity

998
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:47,120
policy perspective what the new

999
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:49,790
administration will prioritize we have

1000
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:52,160
clear we have a clear US position at

1001
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:53,630
this point that we must renegotiate

1002
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,180
these things and we've convinced almost

1003
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:58,850
all of the 41 countries that this is

1004
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:02,810
ultimately a dragnet that is caught up

1005
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:05,690
too much in in its attempts to protect

1006
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:08,270
the innocent right but we just don't

1007
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:11,930
know so it's a big question right now if

1008
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:13,310
we don't get agreement this year I might

1009
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:14,990
not be joking about that State

1010
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:17,870
Department drone next time we leave the

1011
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:18,709
country we might you know we might not

1012
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:21,230
get sent back

1013
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:22,640
and folks like me and folks who have

1014
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:24,200
been working on these types of problems

1015
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,140
for a long time

1016
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:31,730
you know maybe told to just shut up in

1017
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:35,089
pen test some more so finally the love

1018
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:36,680
stage now I have a whole section in here

1019
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,340
and I'm pretty sure I only have like 15

1020
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,109
minutes left

1021
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:44,570
is that true who's keeping time for me I

1022
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:47,480
have 10 I'm 10 minutes left so I'm gonna

1023
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:50,240
sum it up for you I will click through

1024
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,490
some of these slides but really there is

1025
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,149
a video where I actually talk through a

1026
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:57,589
lot of the stuff in about six minutes

1027
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:59,390
and I don't want to spend my 6 minutes

1028
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:01,940
talking through vulnerability

1029
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:03,980
coordination maturity model but it's

1030
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,770
essentially the melding of what I

1031
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:08,330
learned as a hacker practitioner what I

1032
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:10,370
learned working for a giant mega

1033
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:11,920
corporation what I learned reporting

1034
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:14,000
security vulnerabilities to

1035
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,490
organizations and governments of all

1036
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,500
sizes and capabilities these were the

1037
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:22,549
five different capability areas that I

1038
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:25,160
noticed were great indicators of huge

1039
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:26,710
success or miserable failures so I'm

1040
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:31,339
just gonna click through real quick

1041
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:32,810
because what you really want to know all

1042
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,750
right so this is the maturity model how

1043
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:38,029
many of you use maturity models at all

1044
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:39,970
right this is the very first one and the

1045
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:42,350
only one for vulnerability coordination

1046
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:44,060
right so there are maturity models for

1047
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:47,240
incident response tons and tons of those

1048
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:49,430
that's when something bad has already

1049
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,049
happened to you there are maturity

1050
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:52,490
models for building more secure code if

1051
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,650
that's what you happen to do not

1052
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:56,540
everybody does that that's great if you

1053
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:59,090
build code but there has been no

1054
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:01,009
maturity model yet for vulnerability

1055
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:04,660
coordination and this is the first one

1056
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:06,440
so essentially organizational analytics

1057
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:08,000
communications engineering and

1058
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,650
incentives a lot of people think it's

1059
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,380
super easy all you have to do to start a

1060
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:15,530
Bolen disclosure program is just put up

1061
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:18,650
an email address and then magic will

1062
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:20,330
happen so organizationally you just have

1063
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:22,310
to have some agreement that you're gonna

1064
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:25,490
do something about bugs that come in at

1065
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:27,440
the very expert level you've got not

1066
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:29,359
just these processes that you follow

1067
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,360
where you're going ahead and you're

1068
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,670
following your ISO standards ISO 29 147

1069
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,700
ISO

1070
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:37,500
3 0 1 1 1 your your religious moments

1071
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,149
you know in trying to follow the rules

1072
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,730
and be pious when it comes to

1073
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:43,200
vulnerabilities this is at the expert

1074
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:45,750
level where you actually have dedicated

1075
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,730
personnel the idea behind this maturity

1076
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:49,589
model is remember I mentioned I had been

1077
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:52,319
a Linux developer at one point in time I

1078
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:54,480
was able to get two out of three of

1079
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,549
these maturity levels all by myself I

1080
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,619
had permission from my management to

1081
00:42:56,549 --> 00:43:01,650
take on yet another hat with no increase

1082
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:04,710
in pay and decide to do a security

1083
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:06,780
program right but I wrote down what I

1084
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:09,059
was doing I propagated what it was I

1085
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:10,470
created a playbook and there we were we

1086
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:13,079
were at the second stage and it was an

1087
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:14,339
army of one so actually an army of part

1088
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:17,630
of one because I was actually supposed

1089
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:19,890
to write code and ship it as well

1090
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:21,270
next one engineering this is where

1091
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:23,368
everyone thinks they need to concentrate

1092
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:25,230
all of their resources and that's great

1093
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:26,700
until somebody says you know what all

1094
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:28,380
these engineers should be working on our

1095
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,930
next product or our next website or our

1096
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:33,660
next service or whatever it is and you

1097
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:36,808
get your engineers constantly taken away

1098
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:39,029
now I mentioned with a Microsoft bug

1099
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:40,950
bounty program there was a way to

1100
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:43,230
actually align exactly what the

1101
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:44,700
engineers were working on with exactly

1102
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:47,069
what you wanted the hackers to go look

1103
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:49,020
for and that was a way to use a bug

1104
00:43:47,069 --> 00:43:51,630
bounty as a structured incentive program

1105
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:53,759
to carve out this is what we want you to

1106
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:55,290
look at this is when and you'll get paid

1107
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,520
and you'll get your name up up in lights

1108
00:43:55,290 --> 00:44:00,960
and it totally worked

1109
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:04,680
all the way also interesting is that bug

1110
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,780
reports for other versions of ie dropped

1111
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:09,808
to near zero that month they were

1112
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:13,920
literally all just gunning for ie11

1113
00:44:09,809 --> 00:44:15,359
so okay so engineering wise you know you

1114
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,540
have to have a way to deal with these

1115
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:20,549
things at the very expert level you have

1116
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:22,410
to be able to do root cause analysis and

1117
00:44:20,549 --> 00:44:24,299
ideally stop making the same programming

1118
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:26,009
mistakes over and over again eliminate

1119
00:44:24,299 --> 00:44:27,780
entire classes of vulnerabilities where

1120
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:29,910
you can't but this takes a degree of

1121
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:33,660
doing it for a while to be able to start

1122
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:35,399
identifying those patterns communication

1123
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,460
because dogs and cats should talk to

1124
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,299
each other before they live together

1125
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:41,150
communication is really important not

1126
00:44:39,299 --> 00:44:43,380
just between you and the finder

1127
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:45,510
potentially this is an issue where you

1128
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,290
know it's a customer or it's a publicly

1129
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,700
disclosed issue

1130
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:49,770
and you have to go deal with it at

1131
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,810
certain levels you're gonna have to

1132
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:54,450
differentiate your communication between

1133
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:56,580
different audiences technical audiences

1134
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:58,680
versus non-technical audiences

1135
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:01,380
potentially government regulators if

1136
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,730
you're in that space and then the last

1137
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:05,790
bit expert structured information

1138
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:09,210
sharing programs with coordinated

1139
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:10,610
distribution of remediation so how many

1140
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:13,470
of you have heard of the mat program

1141
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:14,820
Microsoft Active protections program so

1142
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:16,529
that's a program that was launched in

1143
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:18,240
2008 where Microsoft will actually give

1144
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:22,890
proof of concept exploit code and

1145
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:24,779
detailed technical information to you

1146
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:27,240
know defense service providers like

1147
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,530
antivirus companies ids/ips and the

1148
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,270
reason for that is they give it to them

1149
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:32,280
with enough time that those folks can

1150
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:34,410
build protection signatures so that they

1151
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:37,140
roll out at the same time as Patch

1152
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:40,230
Tuesday patches that is what's called

1153
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:42,330
expert where you're able to mobilize all

1154
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:46,490
of your defenders in the ecosystem to

1155
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:46,490
come out at once and coordinate the

1156
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:52,770
analytics so obviously you need to be

1157
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:54,360
able to analyze what's coming in to try

1158
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:55,470
and improve not just your process for

1159
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,680
handling the vulnerabilities but

1160
00:45:55,470 --> 00:46:00,270
actually how you're dealing with

1161
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,589
deployment if you're an all deployment

1162
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:03,390
house and you don't write any of your

1163
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:05,880
own code you just deploy other people's

1164
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:08,390
or if you're a development house and you

1165
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,410
do some or somewhere in between

1166
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:14,279
real-time telemetry of active

1167
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:17,629
exploitation at the expert level that is

1168
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:21,390
that could probably be summed up in

1169
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:23,790
watching for indications that something

1170
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:25,830
is being exploited in the wild how many

1171
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:28,200
of you recently heard about Microsoft

1172
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:32,850
and Google having yet another disclosure

1173
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:34,319
argument right yes so Google said we're

1174
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:36,630
following our policy and we're leasing

1175
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:39,390
this within seven days because we see

1176
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:41,550
evidence of exploitation in the wild so

1177
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:42,839
I think Microsoft executives said you

1178
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:45,720
know their usual tisk tisk

1179
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:47,070
thou shalt not well I wrote Microsoft's

1180
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,080
Vil and disclosure policy and there is

1181
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:50,760
actually a provision for that in there

1182
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,799
it's just written a little bit

1183
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:55,710
differently and it follows a different

1184
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,350
trajectory of mapping where you actually

1185
00:46:55,710 --> 00:47:00,120
have to start responding and start not

1186
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:02,759
necessarily dropping zero-day but

1187
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:04,859
start sending out notifications to

1188
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,390
people about a vulnerability that has

1189
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,890
not yet been patched but you were seeing

1190
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:10,470
exploitation in the wild there are

1191
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:12,060
provisions for that in both of their

1192
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:13,680
security policies and coordinated

1193
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:16,920
disclosure policies just different

1194
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,839
triggers but knowing this and being able

1195
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,290
to pivot on that information

1196
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:25,890
that's the advance or the expert level

1197
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:27,870
incentives at the very least saying that

1198
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:29,339
you will not pursue legal action against

1199
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:31,230
hackers who come forward with

1200
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:33,210
vulnerability information and give you a

1201
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:34,980
little chance to fix it the very least

1202
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:37,080
that should be the bare minimum an

1203
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:40,560
incentive and put up a way for them to

1204
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:42,660
contact you obviously you can expand

1205
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:45,090
into financial rewards but again that is

1206
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,620
not for people who have never done this

1207
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:49,530
before

1208
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:51,509
typically at the expert level you

1209
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:53,700
understand what your adversary behavior

1210
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:55,470
is you understand what the markets look

1211
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,149
like for your vulnerabilities if your

1212
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:59,549
vulnerabilities are even traded in other

1213
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:01,350
markets not all of yours are but certain

1214
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:02,880
of them are and certain of the products

1215
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:04,230
you deploy those those vulnerabilities

1216
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,790
are traded into other markets

1217
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:08,280
but understanding those markets and

1218
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:11,490
being able to manipulate them like the

1219
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,840
traffic shaping I showed you earlier so

1220
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:15,299
someone's gonna disclose a bug to you

1221
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,670
someone will breach you it is not a

1222
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:20,160
matter of if it's when I won't ask you

1223
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:21,960
to raise your hands of who have had a

1224
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,220
vulnerability just goes to them or who

1225
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:27,720
has been breached because it's all of

1226
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:32,250
you let's see so what is the actionable

1227
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:34,410
stuff that you can do not only does it

1228
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:36,780
make sense for you to take your own

1229
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:39,870
security journey here figure out where

1230
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:42,360
you are in the maturity of looking at

1231
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:44,460
vulnerability information how many of

1232
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:46,110
these capabilities do you even have have

1233
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:48,870
you thought about a scenario in which

1234
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:50,940
it's not your bug at all but it's the

1235
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:53,069
next heartbleed and you've incorporated

1236
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:54,780
it or you've deployed it somehow in your

1237
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:56,580
networks and you have to be able to

1238
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:58,800
respond you have to be able to

1239
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:03,029
coordinate have you thought about it

1240
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,920
well looking at this your first steps

1241
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:07,050
can be to start a vulnerability

1242
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,820
disclosure program definitely not a good

1243
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:11,660
idea to start out the gate with a bug

1244
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:13,300
bounty program if you're not ready and

1245
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:17,690
then

1246
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:19,790
finally to take it back a level this was

1247
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:22,640
my security journey you know this this

1248
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:24,680
is what I've spent the last oh god it's

1249
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,450
almost 2017 okay what I've spent the

1250
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:29,450
last almost eighteen years doing

1251
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:32,600
professionally in some form and much

1252
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:33,919
longer than that as a hobbyist all of

1253
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:37,250
our journeys are going to be different

1254
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:40,220
but one of the things that I look at is

1255
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:42,380
that questioning the existing models and

1256
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:44,600
building a model that takes a more

1257
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:46,520
holistic view of all of the data that

1258
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,589
you're really looking at and not just

1259
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:50,180
the data but the behaviors of the

1260
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:53,150
parties involved what are the

1261
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:55,640
motivations and what do they want to me

1262
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:58,400
that's always been the key in convincing

1263
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:59,779
large organizations or governments to do

1264
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,820
something they had sworn they would

1265
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:04,250
never do and actually to their great

1266
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:06,440
benefit if they started doing it but not

1267
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:08,360
like crazy people who tried to run a

1268
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:13,040
marathon if they've never actually

1269
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:14,720
gotten off of their couch right the last

1270
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:18,470
thing I'll say is the Internet has no

1271
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:21,649
borders we are a global network of

1272
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:24,709
defenders and this administration or not

1273
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:28,000
I plan on continuing that work and I

1274
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:28,000
hope you'll join me thank you

1275
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:33,469
