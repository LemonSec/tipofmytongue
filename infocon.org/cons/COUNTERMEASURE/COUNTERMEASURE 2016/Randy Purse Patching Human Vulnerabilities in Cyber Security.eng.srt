[Music]

2
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,009
well thank you very much so I'm I've

3
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,840
been at TSE for about six years now and

4
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:32,110
before that I was with the military I

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,360
have a I've done a number of security

6
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:37,320
jobs in the in the military mostly boots

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:41,170
on the ground type jobs as opposed to

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,000
your world I was not really associated

9
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:46,300
to IT except one time when I was tasked

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,699
as a ISS Oh within an organization and I

11
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,718
really didn't have much training and I

12
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:51,989
don't know how many of you have

13
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:55,089
experienced is SOS before that aren't

14
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,530
yeah typically they're pulled from some

15
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:59,469
other domain and then all of a sudden

16
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,969
they're introduced to IT and it was an

17
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:02,109
interesting experience for me and that

18
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:04,120
was towards the latter end of my career

19
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:06,159
and then I started getting into

20
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,750
information operations and such so my

21
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,820
background is quite diverse in the

22
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:13,180
security space I'm actually a learning

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,100
and development guy for a long time now

24
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,870
and my studies are particularly around

25
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,030
human systems integration that kind of

26
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:22,060
thing so if you're wondering why I'm

27
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,890
here instead of an IT guy that's why I'm

28
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:27,369
not an IT guy

29
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:30,189
so I interface with technology stops at

30
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:32,560
the monitor okay I can turn it on and

31
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:34,600
turn it off as the helpdesk tells me

32
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,090
every time I screw up something so

33
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,699
anyway so I just want to get a feel for

34
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:42,700
the room how many we are with small

35
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:46,390
small agencies the small organizations

36
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:52,689
say less than one hundred okay medium

37
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:54,430
like 100 to 500 and large so most yet

38
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:56,020
from large organizations so there's

39
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,820
going to be interesting discussion

40
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,130
because this matters the size of your

41
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,199
organization matters right size matters

42
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,089
a little bit but when we're going

43
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,979
through this you'll see why we don't we

44
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,200
don't need to be wrapped around the size

45
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:09,520
of our organization but it does matter

46
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,079
how you interface within your

47
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,930
organization how many are in

48
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:18,400
client-facing sort of part of their

49
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:20,550
organization right okay so everybody

50
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,540
mostly the others are in the back-end

51
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,970
infrastructure that kind of thing okay

52
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,429
good so this

53
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,530
this will matter to everybody that's in

54
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,680
the in the audience and we'll go through

55
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:35,110
why in a few minutes here so here's the

56
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,550
first thing I want to talk a little bit

57
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,310
about this because it's been phenomenal

58
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:42,790
the amount of times I've heard about

59
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,200
people humans different types of leaders

60
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,200
different types of activities that are

61
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,109
going on within an organization

62
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,720
resistance motivation fear confidence

63
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,730
risk all these things are sort of human

64
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,720
related conceptions human related issues

65
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:01,209
and there's been a number of speakers so

66
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,990
far in the conference that have actually

67
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:07,150
fed into this quite well so security is

68
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:11,170
definitely more than an IT problem okay

69
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:13,060
and I like the second one varying levels

70
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,329
of insecurity okay we know that already

71
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:19,570
that this security in our business is a

72
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:22,030
risk managed issue right we don't have

73
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,950
100% security anywhere but the other

74
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:28,270
thing about this particularly given the

75
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:29,890
author I think that the understanding

76
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,110
that security is a human conception

77
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:35,018
matters a lot throughout my conversation

78
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:37,870
here and we'll talk about that as we get

79
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:44,440
in a little bit more detail so here are

80
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:46,000
the objectives and kind of contrary to

81
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,680
most of the discussion in here I'm not

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,970
going to talk about adversarial actors

83
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,890
I'm going to talk about Natta non

84
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:54,280
adversarial actors within your security

85
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,589
domain okay and the other thing I'm

86
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,400
going to talk about is basically

87
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,200
opportunities and interventions with

88
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,820
human systems this is not necessarily

89
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,410
about security awareness this is about a

90
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,959
lot of other things that are piling into

91
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,640
that and why that matters to me is

92
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,470
because again it's about human systems

93
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,839
integration human performance in the

94
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,640
roles of security and in other roles

95
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,320
within the organization that supports

96
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,959
security so we're going to I'm going to

97
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,978
talk a bit about the problem and and

98
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,750
then I'm going to talk a little bit

99
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:24,669
about a process a recommended approach

100
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,760
and then if we get some time we'll do

101
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:29,169
the case studies but they're not really

102
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,820
critical but it's just to sort of drive

103
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:35,280
home some of the points about looking

104
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,280
beyond the technical solution

105
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,719
interesting statement here most

106
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:49,419
organizations we've already identified

107
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,740
clearly within the conference so far

108
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:51,039
that there's nobody that has a perfect

109
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,899
setup

110
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:54,610
nobody adds the dream world nobody has

111
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:57,789
an organizational setup that is perfect

112
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:01,689
for security this is just another pile

113
00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:04,949
on that idea in that concept so let's

114
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:04,949
talk about a bit bit about the problem

115
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:11,050
let's talk about a bit bit about the

116
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,609
problems there we go so lots of other

117
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,849
people have had stats so I'm going to

118
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,740
prefer my stats here to degree to which

119
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:20,909
these are actually accurate depending on

120
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:25,419
the context is a different is

121
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:27,550
potentially debatable but in the

122
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:29,318
incident world 95% of all incidents

123
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,610
investigated recognizes human errors

124
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,419
contributing factor how many would agree

125
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:36,129
with that statement why do you have any

126
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:46,448
does anybody have any sort of contrary

127
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:48,369
in view of that yeah absolutely it's all

128
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:51,069
part of one big picture right so that's

129
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:52,899
exactly it so even if you go back to the

130
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:55,509
very conception of what you want is just

131
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:57,339
in your security architecture if you

132
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:58,959
miss something that is human error so

133
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:01,689
when you get in there and you start

134
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,969
rooting around in that until AI and ml

135
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:06,009
starts getting solving a lot of our

136
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:07,419
other problems you're still going to see

137
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,009
this and we're going to see human

138
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:12,308
interaction within the security world

139
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:13,569
for decades to come yet and aiming then

140
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:18,009
we don't know what the influence is

141
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:19,929
going to be right and in the other space

142
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:22,089
about vulnerabilities this is sort of in

143
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:23,498
the preventive side of things 76% of

144
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:25,240
identified vulnerabilities throughout

145
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:27,069
systems enterprise World War two years

146
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,990
old and almost nine percent were over

147
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:31,689
ten years old this one's a little dated

148
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,729
2014 the other one was 2015 but they're

149
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:35,110
they're both relatively reliable and

150
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:38,050
guess what they don't change a lot over

151
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,879
time which talks to me about a systemic

152
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,499
issue within the security community writ

153
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:47,139
large and within the business community

154
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:49,240
so my premise here or my whole proposal

155
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:51,099
here is about it's not just a technical

156
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,829
problem okay there's a requirement to

157
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:56,330
integrate the technical with the human

158
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:57,439
systems and we often

159
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,330
I've seen it I've been seeing it

160
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,240
firsthand for decades actually where

161
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:04,849
there's a focus on the development of a

162
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,860
certain pathway workflows to around a

163
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:09,169
specific technical piece of equipment or

164
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,729
piece of IT and then what we end up

165
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:12,710
doing is we kind of ignore everything

166
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:16,159
else beyond that an initial technical

167
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:19,520
interface human factors engineering for

168
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:23,349
instance is primarily driven towards the

169
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,508
physiological physical and sometimes the

170
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:29,120
psychological attention of the people

171
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:30,379
who directly operate whatever piece of

172
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,280
equipment or people that every piece of

173
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:37,879
kit is involved it rarely extends beyond

174
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:41,378
one layer and so that's what we're going

175
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,379
to talk about a little bit more here so

176
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:50,120
this is what I'm promoting systems

177
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:51,860
integrated view everybody understands

178
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,270
systems everybody understands systems of

179
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,060
systems and lots of people here have

180
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,318
heard of systems approach right this is

181
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,900
what we're trying to talk about here

182
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:02,629
just sort of the move our thinking about

183
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,818
the problem space beyond the technical

184
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:06,620
capacity to technical capability and

185
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:08,090
you'll see that and you know it you're

186
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,469
already aware of this we've heard a lot

187
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:12,409
of discussion about it and people have

188
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:14,150
talked about it so they know and it's

189
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:16,339
really it was really sort of refreshing

190
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,169
to hear that and hear some of the

191
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:20,029
speakers talk about the challenges this

192
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:21,979
is a significant challenge in our

193
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:28,099
community right we need to find ways to

194
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:31,758
respond to it just to put another bent

195
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:33,529
on it there's no way of pulling off the

196
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,240
human in the loop here the human is

197
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:37,099
almost continuously in the loop in some

198
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:41,630
capacity within any kind of

199
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:43,070
organizational security so human

200
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,810
dimensions of security which is where

201
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,630
we're starting from with this is still

202
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,518
talking about the problem space first

203
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,890
there's an individual and a collective

204
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,899
the focus within the security community

205
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,910
that I'm aware of basically seems to be

206
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:57,890
focused on the individual doesn't really

207
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,719
attend to the collective very much okay

208
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:02,029
which is the first issue that we need to

209
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,730
challenge then there's the various

210
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:06,829
dimensions within that space the physics

211
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,020
physical physiological like I said in

212
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:10,180
some cases particularly in the

213
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:16,329
development of equipment

214
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:18,819
or in a new in a new stream of product

215
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:21,970
service delivery you may have some

216
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,680
really good identify identification of

217
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,420
human factors that are related to that

218
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,189
you'll talk about the technical

219
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:29,949
interactions the button ology so to

220
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:32,290
speak your organ omicron the piece of

221
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:34,089
equipment or piece of kit the physical

222
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,310
health and safety associated that piece

223
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:38,260
of kit that's fine that's all great

224
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,880
stuff there's certainly stuff that's

225
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,490
missing in here because we know within

226
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,810
the IT world the physical physiological

227
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,060
and ergonomic functions of the

228
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:48,939
individual pertaining to the IT haven't

229
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:55,569
really been all that relevant right so

230
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:57,100
yeah absolutely yeah it's user

231
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,200
interfaces it's a lot of other things

232
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,240
too right but the user interface when

233
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,190
they talk about HFE or human factors

234
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,140
engineering they're primarily concerned

235
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,660
with the button ology how is it working

236
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,850
what's you know what's the visual acuity

237
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,920
of the people and how does that fit on

238
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,350
the screen etc but a lot of the

239
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,209
motivations intents intentions and

240
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,910
things like that aren't often considered

241
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:21,819
they are in some cases but aren't often

242
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,380
considered in the human factors that's

243
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,470
where we get into the psycho psycho

244
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:28,089
cognitive aspects most of everybody in

245
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,800
the room has been associated with

246
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:32,410
training in some way shape or form right

247
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,140
and learning this is where a lot of this

248
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:39,310
comes in but there are a lot of other a

249
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:44,970
lot of other potential connectors to the

250
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:47,050
psycho cognitive of aspects of security

251
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,680
certainly there's knowledge their skills

252
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,510
and abilities

253
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,459
there's certainly attitudes and

254
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:54,180
motivations and then there's a

255
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:56,349
psychological help of safety absolutely

256
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,420
within here however when we're talking

257
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,220
about security is when and particularly

258
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:04,150
and we had this discussion with a with

259
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:06,130
with the discussion yesterday about the

260
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:10,319
phishing exercises right we've had

261
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:12,959
talked about this the user as an example

262
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:17,010
most users know they shouldn't do stuff

263
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:19,390
but yet they still do stuff most

264
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,069
executives know they shouldn't do

265
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,930
certain stuff for they need to do stuff

266
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,070
but they don't do stuff

267
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,630
so there's things that get in the way

268
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,060
there now what are those things and how

269
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,830
do we reconcile those and that's that's

270
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,199
what we're going to talk about not just

271
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:34,440
for users but across the spectrum of

272
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,790
people that are within an organization

273
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,620
this is another place where there's been

274
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,300
actually very little study and very

275
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,480
little understanding within the security

276
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,449
community in the IT security community

277
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,959
is about the collective the social

278
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:52,180
cultural aspects of what we do and how

279
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,670
we how we influence social cultural

280
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:57,310
norms within an organization to adapt

281
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,689
better and adopt better security

282
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,160
practices everybody talks about a

283
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,980
security culture no one knows how to

284
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,899
bring one together right so this is

285
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,149
about it formal informal relationship

286
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:09,149
structures values interests policies

287
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:12,670
human practice processes and practices

288
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:15,670
organizational group custom safety these

289
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:18,760
all matter right if you want if you want

290
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:21,189
your organization to shift even a little

291
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,740
bit they matter and and if you're

292
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:25,180
looking at change strategies any kind of

293
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,260
change management change strategies

294
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,910
they're looking at these things and

295
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,860
saying how are we going to move the

296
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,600
organization or the group or the team or

297
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,820
the individual a little bit to the right

298
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,500
so that we understand that they're

299
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,900
improving and they're they're they're

300
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,839
needing cultural norms or meeting the

301
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:44,579
type of performance and behavior that we

302
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:44,580
want demonstrated in our organization

303
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:50,560
now so this is sort of taken from a

304
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:52,029
human performance technology model that

305
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,770
basically says you know there's more

306
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:55,060
views here and this is this is kind of

307
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,610
important when you're looking at the

308
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,640
context in which the worker is required

309
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,080
to do stuff okay the context in which

310
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,199
the manager is required to make

311
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,730
decisions the context in which the

312
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,900
executive is expected to lead an

313
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:13,390
organization all the dark lines are

314
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,279
about what normally gets concrete or its

315
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:17,110
explicit within the organization then

316
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,540
there's the underlying in the blue that

317
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,860
becomes a little bit more tacit that's

318
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,079
implicit sometimes within the

319
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,600
organization we don't ask them unburied

320
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:27,910
those these are often buried within the

321
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,880
organization we need to find these at

322
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:33,130
least and talk about them very difficult

323
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,320
sometimes okay and I know this is a

324
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,620
challenge I've been doing this for 20

325
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,180
years now

326
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,710
I know it's a challenge but we need to

327
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,910
we need to start thinking about this

328
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,020
within the security community because

329
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,670
some of the things we're talking about

330
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,319
here or at the core of what somebody

331
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:50,030
does in an organization and why they're

332
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:53,870
doing it any questions about this here

333
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:57,290
but this structure basically the worker

334
00:13:53,870 --> 00:14:00,530
is nested in a root work group or a team

335
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:02,000
and that is nested in the work and then

336
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:04,790
there's a workplace in the world and

337
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,130
they're all influencing down and the

338
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:10,160
worker is also influencing up okay so

339
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:13,700
it's all nested it's human complexity

340
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,870
and we need to appreciate that we may

341
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,760
not be able to do everything we want

342
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,260
about do about it but we need to

343
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:24,530
appreciate that what we're dealing with

344
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:27,680
is complexity so generating questions

345
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:30,110
about human performance and whether

346
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,770
individual or collective there's lots of

347
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:35,990
different influences and there's

348
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:38,180
management methods motives etc somebody

349
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:42,800
anybody seen Ishikawa diagram before

350
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:45,890
fishbone diagram for identifying at

351
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,530
cause and effect anybody seen this type

352
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,720
of thing before if you have great then

353
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:52,610
it's a phenomenal tool when you're

354
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,490
sitting down either by yourself trying

355
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,500
to figure out a situation or ideally

356
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,810
with a bunch of other stakeholders who

357
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,430
share different perspectives so you can

358
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:04,729
actually tackle some of the challenge

359
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:07,219
that are in here it's just to help

360
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,780
brainstorm some of the potential issues

361
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:12,470
that could be related to individual and

362
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:14,569
collective performance one thing I want

363
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:18,020
to note here is as we're discussing this

364
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:19,400
how many what do you know from this

365
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:25,550
other than the fact that they all begin

366
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:27,650
with them oh that's your Norfolk yeah is

367
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,300
there any sort of you're in an

368
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:33,250
organization now what do you see there

369
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,250
relate relative to the organization so

370
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:40,699
guess what we all have there a little we

371
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,220
all have people in our organization that

372
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:45,290
are experts at handling the money well

373
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,330
they may not be experts they are the

374
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,490
people who handle the money we have

375
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,390
people who deal with logistical issues

376
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,940
within organized

377
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,769
we have a people who deal with the

378
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,899
processes and policies within our

379
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:58,519
organization we have people who deal

380
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:00,500
with the manpower or women power in

381
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:02,570
organizations there's people who

382
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,160
schedule time and manage the time within

383
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,440
the organization there's people who

384
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,319
acquire and run the machines there's

385
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,180
people who take measures there's people

386
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,010
who are responsible for leading and

387
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,349
guiding individuals and there's people

388
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:18,170
who work on constructing teams and

389
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,670
effective work groups so guess what

390
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,709
you're not in this alone

391
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,779
when you're trying to identify the

392
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:25,518
individual and collective performance

393
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:28,220
issues within the security team or

394
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,720
within the organization you know what

395
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,110
drag some of these other people in there

396
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,540
with you leverage the expertise and the

397
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,399
experience within the organizations to

398
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,490
help you come to grips with the extent

399
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:43,190
of the problem because I can tell you

400
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,959
right now one person cannot provide the

401
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,100
whole worldview of the organization

402
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,599
doesn't matter how long you've been

403
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,740
there how much experience you have

404
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,959
you've tended to work in a relatively

405
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,880
stable domain of work and you may not be

406
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:58,729
connecting with a lot of other parts of

407
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,949
domain so this will help you a lot too

408
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:03,050
and it builds relationships but it helps

409
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:05,178
you create a better richer picture of

410
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:09,379
what the organization actually the

411
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:10,870
organizational challenges are so here's

412
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:15,770
the tension that we're trying to resolve

413
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:17,809
we know this exists what somebody talked

414
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:20,839
about this this is the gap between

415
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:22,879
security and the business community and

416
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,599
all this the work demands local culture

417
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,189
and budget you know laughs I think was a

418
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:30,590
few weeks ago I heard it termed as a gap

419
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:34,010
of grief for the security people and I

420
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:35,899
get that and and and it is it is it is a

421
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:38,090
hard road to hoe and we've heard many

422
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,860
stories today including Paul just

423
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,510
recently was talking about the struggle

424
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,399
and getting executives to understand

425
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:45,590
well that's because they're working

426
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,500
primarily over here they don't

427
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:50,120
understand this so you need to make it

428
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,040
easier for them to understand that so

429
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,260
and we need to do it in their terms

430
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:58,070
because it's their business it's not

431
00:17:54,260 --> 00:18:00,350
ours ours is security so we can there's

432
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:01,970
ways of bridging this gap and we're

433
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,620
alleviating some of the tensions between

434
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:08,000
the security and the

435
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:09,679
work culture that largely means that if

436
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,720
we really want to be effective here

437
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,600
we're going to have to do a good job of

438
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,460
getting into this space here so going

439
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,649
back to the fishbone diagram it allows

440
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,750
you to explore different aspects of the

441
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:25,880
business so you're able to talk to those

442
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:28,700
ends so overall a different approach is

443
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,580
required I think and we've been

444
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,470
struggling at this within the security

445
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,928
training and education space for quite

446
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:38,809
some time we've been focusing our

447
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:40,550
attentions on security people and then

448
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:42,770
there's a security awareness layer over

449
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:44,300
top the degree to which the

450
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:46,660
effectiveness of the security awareness

451
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:49,220
programs are working and identifying

452
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:53,510
individual roles and responsibilities in

453
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:58,550
an organization for security are mixed

454
00:18:53,510 --> 00:19:02,120
to say the least so I in here we're

455
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:03,860
talking about complexity oK you've got

456
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,510
the technology that you guys are very

457
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,559
familiar with then you understand the

458
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:11,480
dynamic threat the threat is is

459
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:16,040
unpredictable we never we can kind of

460
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:18,980
have we can take some time to think

461
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:21,020
about what the threats potentially going

462
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,550
to do to us we understand threat a actor

463
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,889
capabilities we understand the

464
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:27,800
probability of them potentially wanting

465
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:29,480
something that we have okay so we

466
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,389
understand that we understand the

467
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:35,330
technology and then we insert people and

468
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:37,820
now regardless of how well structured

469
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:40,120
you were here here you've immediately

470
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:43,189
increased your complexity within your

471
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:47,809
organization I'm not going to put a

472
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:49,160
number to it but a lot okay so you're

473
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:50,960
going to have a reduced ability means

474
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,510
you can't reduce it down to a single

475
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,800
thing uncertain we're always going to be

476
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:57,230
we're living in uncertainty when you

477
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,960
have people associated associated to the

478
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:02,150
productivity of your organization

479
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,770
unpredictability as much as we say we

480
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,210
can predict things within the security

481
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,710
the minute you put people in there

482
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,590
doesn't matter you have an element of

483
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:11,900
unpredictability emergence a lot of the

484
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,750
stuff that happens within within our

485
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,400
world okay

486
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,070
particularly in our in our world because

487
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,460
it's so

488
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:21,600
dynamic it is moving all the time

489
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,580
there's a lot of things we don't know

490
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,928
and then all of a sudden we encounter

491
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,090
something and now we know something we

492
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:29,309
didn't know before and we couldn't have

493
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:31,259
predicted that we know that so lots of

494
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:33,750
stuff is emerging we have a lot of

495
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:36,299
simultaneity going on and things are

496
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,860
being happening all at the same time and

497
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:39,120
they're influencing things up but we

498
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,908
don't know what the outcomes will be

499
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,250
and of course it's multi-layered so

500
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:47,190
complexity so thinking in complexity is

501
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:49,409
a huge issue here and and how do we do

502
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:51,269
this we don't just throw up our hands

503
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:54,570
and say well obviously it's the problems

504
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:56,490
I'm solvable so why do we bother well

505
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,889
you guys are all in the room for a

506
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:00,360
reason and that's why we bought it you

507
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:02,519
know we want to do better we want to get

508
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,049
things going we want our secure the

509
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:07,110
security of organizations to become

510
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:10,019
better so let's talk a little bit about

511
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:13,168
the process again this is just a

512
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:15,299
suggested process there's lots of buried

513
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:19,309
underneath these process large process

514
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:22,830
steps there's there's entire PhD books

515
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:24,509
master's thesis etc associated these so

516
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,820
the idea though is to sort of simplify

517
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:29,070
it a little bit bring it up a notch and

518
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:32,639
say ok this is this is what I recommend

519
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:35,879
you do in trying to check check some of

520
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:37,620
the about check the balance of the

521
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:39,480
security the complexity a little bit

522
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,879
when you're dealing in security issues

523
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,590
and trying to change the security

524
00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:46,678
posture within your organization given

525
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:48,408
the fact that all these human systems

526
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:54,750
are interrelated with the cyber systems

527
00:21:48,409 --> 00:22:00,149
so first thing is defining the problem

528
00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:02,730
correctly I'll submit to you and I've

529
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:05,129
seen it again this is not coming because

530
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:07,340
I this has been something I've

531
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:11,570
experienced the first thing I see is

532
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:15,809
solutions thinking I want a solution now

533
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:17,158
put it in place now and yeah I'm not

534
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:18,870
going to we're not going to spend our

535
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:21,480
time mulling over this we've also heard

536
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:23,489
the word in paralysis of by analysis and

537
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,950
that's not what I'm advocating either

538
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:29,010
but I am advocating me actually clearly

539
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:31,020
define the problem first those of us who

540
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:33,090
are engineers who work with IT systems

541
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,860
understand problem Decimus definition

542
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:37,230
phase definition phase within

543
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,100
requirements that's all we're looking at

544
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,410
here okay

545
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:43,230
is it a perception of a security problem

546
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,730
is there data suggesting that there may

547
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,470
be a security problem or do we actually

548
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:49,410
have evidence of the security problem

549
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:51,770
right these are three very different

550
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:54,570
issues that require different approaches

551
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:57,060
just because somebody reads a broader

552
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:58,740
article and all of a sudden gets scared

553
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,929
because they're hearing about all these

554
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,660
threats from various different actors

555
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:06,600
within and within the world and then

556
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:07,890
they get to their office building the

557
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,669
next day and all of a sudden they're

558
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:13,350
saying okay now I understand the threat

559
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:15,330
so let's go quick let's do something

560
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,399
about it well is that a perception of

561
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:24,540
threat or is that actual understanding

562
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:27,420
of what the security problem is so when

563
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:29,040
you're garnering the opinions about this

564
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,990
and trying to come up with the problem

565
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,210
definition and stuff we all have biases

566
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:35,400
we all have presuppositions before we go

567
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:36,480
into solving any problem biggest thing

568
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,310
is how do you check these how do you

569
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,360
keep them keep them at the door when

570
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:41,610
you're talking about it

571
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,919
critical thinking systems thinking two

572
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:45,810
very good tools that you can pull out of

573
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,540
your toolbox and I got and I have to

574
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:51,060
tell you you have to do this consciously

575
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:52,980
very difficult right I've been caught

576
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,200
numerous times with my assumptions down

577
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,620
right and I need to be you need to be

578
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,580
careful in this space because you got to

579
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:03,600
make sure you're checking your facts and

580
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,980
because you're working with people and

581
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,870
you're working with an organization

582
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,180
things may not be factual

583
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:11,280
they might may not be evident in the

584
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,810
data so you may need to find a

585
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,510
collective perspective a shared

586
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:18,139
understanding and shared meaning within

587
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:20,280
with any group you work with okay

588
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,400
understanding systems thinking is that

589
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:26,070
when we put a piece in a good example is

590
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,960
putting an inline defensive mechanism in

591
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:31,500
your system do I understand everything

592
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:33,150
that's associated with that have I

593
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,500
understood that the resources required

594
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,380
for that do I understand the management

595
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,950
around that do I understand the

596
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,990
implications of that to the

597
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:43,650
organizational operation of the system

598
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:47,410
operation okay

599
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:52,360
so here's the process the suggested

600
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:54,370
approach iterative so I heard about at

601
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,530
least seven times yesterday about

602
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:58,929
iteration iterative incremental

603
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:02,129
approaches we can't swallow the elephant

604
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,130
hold okay

605
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:08,230
free main points context analysis gap

606
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:12,100
analysis options analysis and I know the

607
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:14,650
word analysis may drive some people

608
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:17,350
buggy okay I understand that but the

609
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:19,840
context analysis here is really really

610
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:21,520
important and this is about you getting

611
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,760
to know your organization in the people

612
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,800
you're deciding you're creating the

613
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,940
organizational or trying to tackle the

614
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:32,020
problem with so they all have a

615
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,820
relatively common understanding

616
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:36,309
everybody in your organization holds a

617
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:40,000
different perspective right and you need

618
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:43,600
to get the implicit stuff out cultural

619
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,280
norms as an example okay but that

620
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,500
context analysis is really important the

621
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:50,440
gap analysis basically desired versus

622
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,720
current state and any key gaps options

623
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,179
analysis suitable options based on well

624
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,510
balanced criteria and we'll talk about

625
00:25:55,179 --> 00:26:00,700
that a little bit more so stakeholder

626
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:04,510
interests when you're doing your context

627
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:06,040
analysis as I said earlier you know you

628
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,600
have a bunch of experts you have a bunch

629
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,420
of people who are concerned with the

630
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,770
operation of the organization as well

631
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:13,809
invite some other people to the room

632
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:17,170
invite some other people to the table so

633
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:18,550
that you could talk to them right they

634
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,870
all have different interests they all

635
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,399
have different perspectives and they

636
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,280
made like Norden likely will have

637
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,390
different goals that sit below the

638
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:28,629
organizational mission you need to

639
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:29,980
understand those what are some other

640
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,750
things that aren't actually up here

641
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:36,059
about those about those stakeholders

642
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:36,059
what other things might be of concern

643
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:45,340
yeah their own jobs what else what else

644
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:55,049
Oh better what are you concerned about

645
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:57,939
when you're at your work absolutely

646
00:26:55,049 --> 00:27:00,010
absolutely you know what is mike is my

647
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,870
professional reputation at risk what

648
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,970
kind of credibility do I have do I trust

649
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:07,000
other people how do I look in front of

650
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:09,789
others these all matter and you need to

651
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,039
be attuned to that if you want to figure

652
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:13,929
out where the organizational structures

653
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:16,600
are and informal structures in

654
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:18,100
particular right when you're talking

655
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,070
about group norms group norms that

656
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,120
actually are not the explicit

657
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:24,549
requirements within an organization

658
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,350
they're the implicit ones and those you

659
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:28,779
need to pay attention to so when we

660
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:31,899
start talking about security awareness

661
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:33,399
and then the first thing you do when

662
00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:34,689
you're doing your security awareness and

663
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:36,370
you're measuring your awareness program

664
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,870
or your training program or your

665
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:41,678
monitoring program or any other program

666
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:44,439
and you find out later on that the

667
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:47,350
manager and the supervisor don't really

668
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,480
consider measurement important for

669
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:53,168
whatever reason then you've already hit

670
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:54,760
a wall with that little group that could

671
00:27:53,169 --> 00:28:01,649
impact your entire organizational

672
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:04,840
outcome so it matters gap analysis a

673
00:28:01,649 --> 00:28:06,428
variety of sources of information for

674
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,470
both these both the current state in the

675
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:10,330
desired state the whole point is to

676
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:12,250
manage sort of manage the tensions and

677
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:14,590
dilemmas and then the expectations the

678
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:17,019
organization a little bit here okay

679
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:19,840
again all those other people can help

680
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:21,940
you come up with some of this very

681
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,470
difficult for IT guys to go strolling

682
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:26,620
into the finance sector of the

683
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,570
organization and say so what concerns

684
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,129
you they're gonna say what do you want

685
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:32,379
what are you doing here go back in the

686
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:33,610
basement right I used to be in the

687
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,500
basement by the way we just had a little

688
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:38,019
discussion so I used to live in the

689
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,639
basement in an organization so we so I

690
00:28:38,019 --> 00:28:44,260
understand that appreciate that a little

691
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:45,490
bit but so if you drag some of those key

692
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,350
stakeholders with you into the

693
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,059
conversation they're much they're going

694
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,699
to be a conduit into those portions of

695
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:53,090
the organization that matter to you

696
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:57,530
finance matters to you

697
00:28:53,090 --> 00:29:01,250
okay HR matters to you in resolving your

698
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:04,010
IT security problems because a lot of

699
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:06,170
the issues pertain to the human

700
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:10,730
dimensions of the organization the human

701
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:13,550
dimensions of security so this gives you

702
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:15,470
some possible options to be looking at

703
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:21,470
with respect to what you can be doing

704
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:23,060
okay effective and economical some are

705
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:26,150
more effective and economical than

706
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:27,250
others and often you'll need to you

707
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:30,760
because you're dealing with the

708
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:33,830
complexity you'll need to use multiple

709
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:35,360
possible solutions okay we're not

710
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,820
talking about the solutions yet we're

711
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,129
talking about possible solutions okay

712
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:42,200
and look at all the positives here

713
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:43,580
organizational changes personnel changes

714
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,750
incentive work redesign learning

715
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:49,520
training policy changes etc and when you

716
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:53,570
do your analysis if you take systems

717
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:57,530
thinking and you look at okay so I've

718
00:29:53,570 --> 00:30:03,530
got a developer who doesn't do any

719
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:05,720
security testing either before or during

720
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:07,910
the development and then they wait till

721
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,950
post development testing just before

722
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:12,830
going to market we already know we heard

723
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:14,650
yesterday that that's a problem so if we

724
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:18,980
want to set up a security development

725
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:20,600
operations cell and they and/or a secure

726
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,860
development operations cell and we

727
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,409
understand that they're doing it

728
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:26,179
securely we say okay well we know they

729
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:28,700
need some training they'll need some

730
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:31,390
training on security good done we're

731
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:34,880
done we give them training we're good

732
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:35,780
well maybe not right maybe not maybe

733
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,550
that's not the only thing

734
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,139
there's process changes that are going

735
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:40,129
to have to happen there's policy changes

736
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,720
that it's going to have to happen you

737
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:44,360
may have to do some work redesign within

738
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,650
the team I know I'm making this there

739
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:50,149
may be personnel changes you need to

740
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:51,860
make right these are a ripple effect

741
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:53,540
from understanding what the outcome is

742
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:56,199
you want within that within the

743
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,200
organization

744
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:02,580
when you're looking at your options and

745
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:05,180
alternatives then you need to figure out

746
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:08,220
which one is your best option or which a

747
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:10,550
couple of options or options are best

748
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,550
for you

749
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:16,890
options analysis is pretty good lots of

750
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,540
tools out there for this okay and it

751
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:21,510
depends on what your organizational

752
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:23,010
culture is like but ultimately the

753
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:25,200
options analysis supports the

754
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,850
decision-making you want you should be

755
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,430
using balanced criteria we'll talk about

756
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:31,830
that in a second it needs to address the

757
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:34,080
gap you've identified often we end up

758
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:35,970
finding a solution that doesn't address

759
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,340
the gap but we implement that because

760
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:41,040
it's easier but then we don't solve the

761
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:43,129
problem do we we want to help solve the

762
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,129
problem

763
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:50,550
so when we're talking about criteria it

764
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,590
needs to be an open and honest

765
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:55,500
discussion with whoever the

766
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:58,439
decision-makers are whoever is helping

767
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,270
you develop the criteria as well I think

768
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,790
the first one up there value focus is

769
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:05,940
matters again yesterday we heard about

770
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:07,830
that value and that's where the

771
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:10,350
discussion with Tyler about the what do

772
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:16,290
you say it was the what do you call it

773
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:19,740
the Minimum Viable security there were

774
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:21,899
some hackles in the audience yesterday

775
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,810
because of the minimum viable security

776
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:26,220
although as an organization that's what

777
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:29,179
you want you don't want to be investing

778
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:31,320
a lot of your energy in a space that

779
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:35,670
you're not going to get any value for

780
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:38,159
and Paul who was just here talked about

781
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:39,390
he used his here's how my I don't know

782
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,450
how many of you were in here how many

783
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:47,480
saw Paul's presentation yeah you know he

784
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:51,150
showed the value of having an effective

785
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:53,130
resiliency program right and he showed

786
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:56,130
the resilience of the organization in

787
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:58,050
his graph okay so those are the kind of

788
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:00,420
things that matter and they actually

789
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:02,190
matter to us too in IT we you know

790
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,930
nighti security matters the value

791
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,030
matters does sometimes we have a

792
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:08,100
difficult time expressing that up but it

793
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:10,050
matters to us right we don't want to

794
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,459
waste money either we want our money in

795
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:14,700
the right places for the right thing

796
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:16,440
technically sound consistent smaller

797
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,019
number and high in quality comprehensive

798
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,729
mutually exclusive in other words they

799
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:22,469
should Matt do the systems-thinking

800
00:33:20,729 --> 00:33:24,779
think about the whole solution don't

801
00:33:22,469 --> 00:33:26,339
think of a boat apart solution okay

802
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:30,289
there's certain organizations that are

803
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:31,918
certain notorious for buying this

804
00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:34,259
realizing that it may not work

805
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,419
completely and then later on having to

806
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:37,679
go out and buy some other things because

807
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:39,889
it comes out of a different budget in

808
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,080
order to support this capability right

809
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:44,580
be honest be open say this is what we

810
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,710
require in order to make this work and

811
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,449
this is the organizational changes or

812
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:51,210
organizational requirements to make this

813
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:53,190
work trade-offs there's always going to

814
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:56,849
be trade-offs these need to be clearly

815
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:58,440
articulated and you need to be doing it

816
00:33:56,849 --> 00:34:01,408
with the developers with the client and

817
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,669
stakeholders in mind this is important

818
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:03,989
for that buy-in piece everybody

819
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:06,210
understands by and I'm not going to go

820
00:34:03,989 --> 00:34:08,879
into any great amount of detail but if

821
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,949
you want to be accessing resources you

822
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:13,770
don't normally access whether they be

823
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:15,689
personnel or financial or logistical you

824
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:17,940
need to you need to talk to those people

825
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:20,639
so because they'll be able to tell you

826
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:28,230
whether it's feasible legal appropriate

827
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:30,299
to scale etc in generating your options

828
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:31,770
here's some here's some things again

829
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:34,699
lots of tools on the internet for this

830
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:37,730
but if you you're the one to do it great

831
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:40,168
take your time learn about how to do it

832
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:41,789
facilitate the the group that you're

833
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:43,529
working with to try to come up with the

834
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:45,059
solution but if you don't feel

835
00:34:43,529 --> 00:34:46,559
comfortable doing this there's people in

836
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:48,779
your organization particularly the

837
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:51,179
medium and large ones that should have

838
00:34:48,779 --> 00:34:52,980
some capacity be able to do this or they

839
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,839
should be able to tap into a community

840
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,750
that can do this for you smaller

841
00:34:54,839 --> 00:35:00,480
organizations normally even have to tap

842
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,920
into the community somehow hmm but

843
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,589
there's lots of people in this business

844
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,390
okay I do this is the kind of stuff I do

845
00:35:04,589 --> 00:35:07,650
for a living so there's not there's lots

846
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:11,250
of us around it's just a matter of

847
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:12,779
finding it so once you've figured out

848
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,799
what your options are and you figured

849
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:15,510
out you've got your sort of

850
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:17,788
implementation plan in place and you

851
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:19,410
know where you're going to go so you've

852
00:35:17,789 --> 00:35:21,240
planned it you've implemented here's

853
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:23,609
where we talked about this a bit

854
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,109
yesterday and again Paul talked about

855
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:27,029
this about measuring

856
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:29,220
you need to be able to figure out if

857
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:31,680
you're having the desired effect

858
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:33,750
you wanted a desired outcome make sure

859
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,240
you've measured it and you can circle

860
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:39,330
back and figure out if it did if it hit

861
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,609
the mark if it didn't then you got to go

862
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:44,040
back and bring it back into loop again

863
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:45,540
the one thing I would caution you on is

864
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,370
when you're evaluating and measuring

865
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,720
your outcomes and how those are

866
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:52,620
affecting the security of the

867
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,149
organization if you're having even some

868
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:57,509
of the desired effect that's great if

869
00:35:54,150 --> 00:36:00,360
you want to go kick it back in to do

870
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:02,940
more planning to improve then the next

871
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,650
baseline is where you're at don't take

872
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:07,350
the previous baseline and say well we've

873
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:09,930
proved 150% over the last six months

874
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:11,370
because right now the base the new

875
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:13,560
baseline is where you're sitting from

876
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:16,020
that's why I like Paul's little

877
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,290
demonstration there of is his resiliency

878
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,400
model well this is for this incident and

879
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:22,080
what does the next students in didn't

880
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,510
say and then what is the next incident

881
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,509
say so trends are important as well so

882
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:34,170
we actually have some time so what we're

883
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:36,420
going to do is we're just going to do a

884
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:38,820
couple of case studies just to see if

885
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,230
you grasp the main points and I'm sure

886
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:43,650
you have but I want to I want to

887
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:46,970
reinforce some of the some of the the

888
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:48,990
messaging here so here's the case study

889
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:51,270
this is who you are you're in meters

890
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:54,979
medium size organization client service

891
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:54,980
a lot of web presence

892
00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:01,620
pretty small IT shop that's pretty

893
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,550
standard too right here's your

894
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,880
assumptions you've got a limited

895
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:06,930
security culture that's not unusual

896
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,190
leadership focus is on client

897
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,549
satisfaction because that's where the

898
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,460
money is

899
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:14,520
and resource allocation is dedicated to

900
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,350
services okay so we're mostly concerned

901
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,740
in this organization about canoe

902
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:23,220
community in our ongoing web presence

903
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:25,770
everybody got that here's the first

904
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:28,529
issue where is the money please take a

905
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:30,509
read on that I'll give you a couple of

906
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:32,760
minutes to read it and then we'll chat

907
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:34,560
about it get some ideas in your mind

908
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,850
about some some of the things particular

909
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,680
looking at the main technical

910
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:38,850
recommendations there and what else

911
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,069
could be considered here

912
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:43,069
from the human dimensions perspective

913
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:21,009
so what pops out at you for the first

914
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:26,980
situation about the recommendation

915
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:26,980
anyway yeah very blanket yeah

916
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:44,920
yeah yeah it's almost certainly that

917
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:48,369
will not solve the problem okay that's a

918
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,990
patch if nothing else there's no there's

919
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:52,450
not a lot of systems thinking going on

920
00:38:49,990 --> 00:39:02,709
here and about addressing the issue

921
00:38:52,450 --> 00:39:04,618
anything else that comes to mind yeah

922
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:06,790
there's no there's no there's no

923
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:13,210
organizational perspective on this it's

924
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:15,670
just one specific area anything else so

925
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:18,069
what kind of solutions what other things

926
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:21,040
should this should if you're the IT

927
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:22,720
security adviser in this case what other

928
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,579
things should you be exploring what

929
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,098
other possibilities should you be

930
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:29,520
exploring here to help them with this

931
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:29,520
problem

932
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:42,380
yep yeah absolutely in fact that that is

933
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:46,689
that is part of the problem here right

934
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,690
so security awareness what else

935
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:00,169
there's a fundamental problem in there

936
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,460
isn't there from an IT security

937
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:05,070
protected security perspective there's a

938
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:09,030
fundamental problem in there and that

939
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:11,240
they haven't got a clue of what sort of

940
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:13,530
what they're doing inside the system so

941
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,270
we don't know what kind of monitoring or

942
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:17,640
management we have of issues that have

943
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:19,980
arrived in the organization so what does

944
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:22,620
it say about our architecture what does

945
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:24,930
it say about a monitoring what does this

946
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:28,380
say about our awareness has already been

947
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:30,480
identified right what does it say about

948
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:36,150
the resources that we have dedicated to

949
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:37,800
this you know we've not we've not been

950
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,620
able to confirm the movement within the

951
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:43,800
organization that's scary stuff right

952
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:45,450
CFO a lot of financial information on

953
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:49,950
the organization some of it could be

954
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:52,410
damning we don't know right so in the

955
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:55,410
context here we know that this is this

956
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:59,399
could be a big issue sensitive financial

957
00:40:55,410 --> 00:41:01,490
files we don't know how bad it's been we

958
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,290
know the problem is that we we've

959
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:08,279
potentially got an issue here with

960
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:09,690
respect to the the intrusion and we

961
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,050
don't know what's gone what's missing

962
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:16,070
what kind of damage been done so we're

963
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:18,630
doing some additional forensics and

964
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:20,070
we're focusing and targeting executive

965
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:23,430
staff like you said so we're not looking

966
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:25,920
at the larger systems picture we don't

967
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:28,379
know if we've actually got a valid risk

968
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,730
assessment for this organization we

969
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:32,640
don't know if the right defensive

970
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:34,860
mechanisms were put up in place to hide

971
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,750
those sensitive files I would suggest

972
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,580
that if those are sensitive files what

973
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:40,170
were they doing in anything connected to

974
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,970
the Internet in the first place right

975
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:44,160
there's lots of questions that need to

976
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:46,500
be asked here but it's if you move back

977
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,440
further there's the security

978
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:52,610
architecture matters the people around

979
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,990
the architecture matters the monitoring

980
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:56,940
organization matters the forensics

981
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:58,709
capability may matter there's lots here

982
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,270
that could matter you need more data I

983
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:01,740
know but there's lots here that could

984
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:03,690
matter you just need to appreciate that

985
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:06,259
it's more than just the incident itself

986
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,260
so

987
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:15,390
next one constant clicker same

988
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,390
organization

989
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:33,180
taken from real-life examples by the way

990
00:42:29,729 --> 00:42:36,410
so not that that matters almost

991
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,410
everything is real life now

992
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:56,470
so what immediately comes to mind based

993
00:42:53,869 --> 00:42:56,470
on what you've seen

994
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:12,300
yeah what else yeah absolutely where's

995
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:14,819
the policies to support this yeah is

996
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:24,390
this something that the organization

997
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:25,680
promotes right anything else yeah

998
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:28,080
absolutely

999
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,879
so they're now extracting restricting

1000
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:33,540
administrative privileges but to who

1001
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,890
when where why maybe maybe that account

1002
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,360
manager actually needs those

1003
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:38,040
administrative privileges for some

1004
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:41,480
reason we don't know we need to

1005
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,480
investigate that further anything else

1006
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:53,369
bang on what is it what that should that

1007
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:56,368
should be a red flag on a problem right

1008
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:58,530
if our monitoring team hasn't picked it

1009
00:43:56,369 --> 00:44:01,140
up and they and our response was delayed

1010
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:03,360
what do we do what's what does that say

1011
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:06,118
we don't know but we need to investigate

1012
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:08,790
it more okay and that will probably

1013
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:11,070
speak to resources or processes or

1014
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:13,020
reporting processes or communications

1015
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:15,030
within the organization all these are

1016
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:18,060
people things not technical things

1017
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:21,060
they're all sort of workflow related or

1018
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:22,320
resource or capability related so you're

1019
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:24,000
getting it that's what it that's exactly

1020
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,770
the point and I know you guys already

1021
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,660
knew this but sometimes we just need to

1022
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:29,640
bring this to light again just to help

1023
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:31,410
sort of uncover some of the challenges

1024
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,180
we have in this space and there are

1025
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:36,600
solutions we just need to follow some

1026
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:41,029
some some appropriate mechanisms to get

1027
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:47,430
us to the proper solutions mr. Einstein

1028
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:49,230
oft-quoted fella go back to problem

1029
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:51,390
definition what is the exact problem

1030
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:55,770
here what are the issues around the

1031
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:58,109
problem that we need to address okay so

1032
00:44:55,770 --> 00:45:03,210
here the qmu securement key key key

1033
00:44:58,109 --> 00:45:05,790
messages okay the humans are completely

1034
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:07,670
integrated into the IT world now there's

1035
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:12,300
no doubt in our mind everybody is

1036
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:14,700
everybody is cyber systems IT systems

1037
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:17,190
there's no doubt in our discussion of

1038
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:19,470
IOT yesterday

1039
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:20,760
means it's just going to get I don't

1040
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:22,200
want to say worse but it's just going to

1041
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,579
get worse before it gets better if it

1042
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,529
gets better

1043
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:27,180
we got numerous challenges we need to

1044
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:29,490
keep the keep in mind how we're going to

1045
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:32,578
address those challenges but always

1046
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:35,160
consider the complexity find ways around

1047
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:37,829
a route or find ways to solve the

1048
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:40,020
problem with the humans in mind at the

1049
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:42,990
outset as opposed to waiting until the

1050
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:45,089
incidence occurs and ensure that we take

1051
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:47,310
when we do designer interventions or

1052
00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:49,078
select our options that we have well

1053
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:51,509
balanced criteria that actually has

1054
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:55,829
consideration from the organization of

1055
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:57,839
the whole and again these aren't onerous

1056
00:45:55,829 --> 00:45:59,670
activities you know the contacts

1057
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,799
analysis got the analysand option else

1058
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:03,930
are not all that onerous they might be

1059
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:06,890
onerous for a 125,000 person

1060
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:10,649
organization with a distributed economy

1061
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:18,598
they're not a big problem for most of us

1062
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:23,180
here so are there any questions no this

1063
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:23,180
is just the this is the plug

1064
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:29,340
