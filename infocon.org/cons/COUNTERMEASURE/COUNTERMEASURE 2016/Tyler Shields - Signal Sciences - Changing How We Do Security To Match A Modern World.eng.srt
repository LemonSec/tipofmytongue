1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,019
[Music]

2
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,740
hey there we go it's time to change and

3
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,869
I don't mean change in the Trump way I

4
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:31,009
just mean it's time for change too early

5
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:32,509
for that joke so yeah so the 90s called

6
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:35,870
they want their application security

7
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:37,820
programs back guys and you know I focus

8
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,519
on application security programs because

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,399
my history and my career has been on the

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,780
last gosh bout eight years now has been

11
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,510
largely focused on mobile and

12
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,010
application security spaces but the

13
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,260
point I'm going to bring up in this

14
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,730
conversation really applied to any kind

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:56,059
of security space that you guys might

16
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:59,089
operate it everything from policy to the

17
00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:01,248
network security to AB sec to any kind

18
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:03,289
of security space so the cool thing

19
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:04,610
about doing a keynote and why I am

20
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:06,530
really really happy to be doing a

21
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,230
keynote I don't have to give you answers

22
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,480
I just have to get up here kind of stir

23
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,820
the pot make everything kind of crazy

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,590
get you guys either angry at me or in

25
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,360
agreement with me and then I get to

26
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,770
leave and you guys have to spend the

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,510
whole rest of this conference trying to

28
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,759
figure out if what I said makes any

29
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:25,060
sense in context of the rest of the

30
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,850
speakers so that's what my goal is today

31
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:32,510
so that's me june nineteen eighty

32
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,250
something roughly my birthday in fourth

33
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:37,520
grade to whatever that works out to an

34
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:40,670
age I'm sitting there hacking on my

35
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,340
Commodore 64 my very first computer the

36
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:45,910
cool thing about this particular photo

37
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:49,070
is that my fingers are actually on the

38
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,899
home row which is really kind of weird

39
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:53,630
to actually have correct typing stance

40
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,060
in fourth grade I have my really

41
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,979
important dart gun which is also very

42
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,110
very important and if you look at the

43
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,900
screen up there there's code on that

44
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:05,030
screen which is really bizarre for a kid

45
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,760
but that was me right that was me in a

46
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,440
nutshell that was me as a kid to be

47
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,789
totally honest with you my grandmother

48
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,170
bought me the computer for my birthday

49
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:14,839
and she gave me the opportunity of

50
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:19,670
buying an altering vehicle and a TV or

51
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,110
the computer and I chosen a TV but but

52
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,149
my parents said that I had no place to

53
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:27,799
ride it so I got the computer changed

54
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:29,900
life forever change my life forever in a

55
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:31,340
good way so this is Lombard Street has

56
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,099
anybody in here been to lombard street

57
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:37,790
before in san francisco supposedly the

58
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:39,379
most crookedest street in in san

59
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,358
francisco and essentially that's been my

60
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:44,030
career ever since ever since I got that

61
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:47,859
first computer in fourth grade I you

62
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:50,629
know as a kid did the traditional hacker

63
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:52,250
carding freaking routine right all of

64
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:54,260
the all of the fun things coming up

65
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,329
through high school in college and then

66
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,220
went out and did spend some time out

67
00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:01,190
Silicon Valley of the security engineer

68
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,829
and went down that bad deep technical

69
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,959
path right went down that deep technical

70
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:09,069
researcher path working for companies

71
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,450
such as at stake semantics Vera code

72
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:13,578
really doing a lot of technical research

73
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,409
work and then one day I kind of flipped

74
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:18,139
it flipped it on its head and decided to

75
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:20,950
become a market analyst with Forrester

76
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:23,209
Research which at the time you're

77
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:26,349
there's another keynote speaker this

78
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:28,489
week for you guys chris eng when i left

79
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:30,108
working with him at Vera code to

80
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:32,900
becoming market analyst he bought me a

81
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:35,299
Darth Vader mask because he said I was

82
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,040
going to the dark side so if they give

83
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,510
you any indication of how weird it was

84
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,230
for me to kind of flip that career and

85
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:44,540
take this this crooked path and as if

86
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,418
being dark Vader wasn't bad enough I

87
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:50,030
then became a vp of marketing and joined

88
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:52,280
like the true Sith right the evil Lords

89
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,590
of the world and that's what I do today

90
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,150
i'm a vp of marketing strategy and

91
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,370
partnership for a company called signal

92
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:03,440
sciences which is a web protection

93
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:05,419
platform based in los angeles so what I

94
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,609
want to talk to you today is a bit about

95
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:10,549
that journey okay it's a bit about going

96
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:12,319
from tech guy to business guy and what I

97
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:14,150
learned switching over to the business

98
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,099
side and how we can apply some of those

99
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,409
teachings and learnings from a business

100
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:22,490
side to how we actually operate in the

101
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:25,520
tech world since we're social media land

102
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:28,550
and we're in you know 2016 I actually

103
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,260
put my torts and quotes in orange so go

104
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,940
ahead and take pictures qui demande

105
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,590
quote them because it'll help you guys

106
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,880
have to not think about how to tweet

107
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:39,580
them later so the modern business were

108
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,080
completely decentralized in mobile in a

109
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,090
knowledge economy you have to go where

110
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,830
the knowledge is so one of the things i

111
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,929
learned from being in the business world

112
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,570
is that you have to follow where the

113
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,430
intelligence is okay we're in a

114
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,320
knowledge economy we're no longer in a

115
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,210
traditional economy where everything

116
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,840
funnels through a centered central choke

117
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:00,039
point of one person who knows everything

118
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,169
intelligence is distributed how we

119
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,650
operate is distributed how we work is

120
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:08,710
distributed this is what worked looked

121
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:11,380
like in the 90s right cubicle farms and

122
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:15,039
old computers and this was just a stock

123
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:17,409
photo so this is not one that I'm in but

124
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,550
that being said that was my home office

125
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:23,380
in 1999 right which is big thick

126
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,120
computers and I know the the resolution

127
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,860
is really bad but I didn't have a great

128
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,180
mobile phone back in nineteen ninety

129
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,770
nine so it was like super small head

130
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,570
blow it up for the screen but as you can

131
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,280
see computers everywhere and I was

132
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,680
advanced I was cutting edge I had

133
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,630
laptops as opposed to towers everywhere

134
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,610
although that being said there is a Sun

135
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,380
workstation over here on the right don't

136
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,860
know if anybody can identify that and

137
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:47,020
all of these systems connected back to

138
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:49,600
data centers right everything came back

139
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,099
through a central point everything came

140
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,740
back through these fancy Dana centers

141
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,690
run by your company you connected maybe

142
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,820
through a VPN if you were advanced

143
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,520
enough to have a VPN and everything came

144
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,900
back and funneled through a specific

145
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,430
single environment they did not look

146
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,590
like this more often than not they

147
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,300
looked like this right which was the

148
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,289
cable hell that we all had to work in

149
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:13,230
back in those days but that being said

150
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:16,960
how's that different from work today oh

151
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:19,750
no my photos not there we're supposed to

152
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,039
be a photo of my offices in la they're

153
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,500
not sure where it actually disappeared

154
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,060
to probably in conversion from from

155
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,940
systems but work today is decentralized

156
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,650
it's mobile it's collaborative its rapid

157
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,110
it's empowered none of these things were

158
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:34,510
the case 20 years ago this these

159
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,220
concepts didn't exist okay everything

160
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:40,120
was slow and centralized and you went

161
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:42,400
through central authorities the work had

162
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,760
completely changed but in a

163
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,820
hyper-connected world experience doesn't

164
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,200
matter as much as the total sum of

165
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,150
wisdom and the speed

166
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,520
which we can get at the answers to our

167
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:56,890
questions ok I think about that for a

168
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,650
second it's not about hiring someone

169
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:01,270
who's done it for 20 years you can get

170
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,620
away with hiring someone much cheaper

171
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,840
who's done it for five to seven years

172
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,240
but knows how to find the answers

173
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,859
quickly ok this is a knowledge world

174
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,930
this is not the traditional centralized

175
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,660
world that we used to work in let's

176
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,560
think about that for a second the world

177
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,140
used to work in what was called

178
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,090
experience curves or learning curves ok

179
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,890
this is something they teach you in in

180
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,200
business school and essentially the

181
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:25,840
concept of an experience curve is the

182
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,300
more you do something the cheaper it

183
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,130
becomes so if we think and we look at

184
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,940
that graph in the top right that's a

185
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:36,670
Ford's Model T price experience curve as

186
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:40,120
he started building more model t ford

187
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:42,970
cars in higher capacity faster in higher

188
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,190
quantity the price per car was able to

189
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:48,340
come down he learned how to make things

190
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:51,130
better faster cheaper he learned labor

191
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:53,890
efficiency product redesign automation

192
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:57,490
ok these are the things that used to be

193
00:07:53,890 --> 00:08:00,460
important in how we did business it's

194
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,960
not like that anymore I would argue that

195
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,909
what's not it's no longer about the

196
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,489
experience curve now don't get me wrong

197
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,870
experience is important it can help but

198
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,450
what is more important is what i call

199
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,490
the collaboration curve ok the

200
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:15,550
collaboration curve is actually a

201
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:17,490
network effect of humans ok as you add

202
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,440
more humans to your work environment

203
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:23,530
they can collaborate together and get at

204
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,840
data and answers to questions faster

205
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,880
than ever before ok it's allowing the

206
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,820
the business world to move in an extreme

207
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,250
rate that we've never seen before so its

208
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:36,220
knowledge engagement network and

209
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,229
performance all coming coming better all

210
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,260
coming together to make work cleaner

211
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:42,520
smoother and easier ok it's a

212
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,810
decentralization that has caused this

213
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,890
curve to overtake the experience curve

214
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,390
so what does that mean with regards to

215
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,670
technology right I've been babbling on

216
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:54,130
and on about business side stuff ok what

217
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,630
it means from technology is that the

218
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,730
integrations that advancements that

219
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:00,520
we've seen in integration in the last

220
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:03,580
few years are enabling the collaboration

221
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,980
curve ok slack is a perfect

222
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:08,800
example of enabling the collaboration

223
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,450
curve it breaks down barriers and silos

224
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,280
between all of the different

225
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,110
organizations sub organizations within

226
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,390
your firms and it allows people to

227
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:20,380
communicate faster more directly get at

228
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:23,230
the data they need slack JIRA data dog

229
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:26,500
Victor ops chef all of these tools are

230
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:28,000
about communication of data and that's

231
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,800
really what's propelling our businesses

232
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,200
faster today than ever before and that's

233
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,120
what's propelling our technology faster

234
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,620
today than ever before so the

235
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,070
fundamental theme of integrations is

236
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,870
collaboration so so far we've hit on a

237
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:43,210
couple of points decentralization and

238
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:49,810
mobility and collaboration has changed

239
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:52,780
in how we do work and what's that what's

240
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:54,839
that give us markets and buyers change

241
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:59,350
their mind faster than ever before

242
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:04,180
buyers are fickle people are fickle okay

243
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:06,070
so decentralization mobile these things

244
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,410
have caused speed of change speed of

245
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:10,210
innovation and speed of market movements

246
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,040
to be drastically faster than ever

247
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,690
before so this is something this is a

248
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,890
slide I've used a number of times over

249
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,360
the last few years hopefully you guys

250
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,040
haven't seen it yet but we're going to

251
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,570
play a quick game down the left column

252
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:24,550
here are a few things telephone radio

253
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:28,870
television I can't really see this so

254
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:32,170
world wide web Facebook ipod AOL draw

255
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:34,240
something and angry birds space how long

256
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,219
did it take each of these to get to 50

257
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,470
million users let's start with the top

258
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:42,700
one telephone anyone want to shout again

259
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:45,760
how long in years 40 years with the

260
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:54,490
guest I heard not bad kind of close to

261
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:58,480
75 radio come on people 38 television

262
00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:00,220
quick here we go we're getting better 13

263
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,960
years for television to get to 50 50

264
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:07,540
million the web you guys are getting it

265
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:11,380
you see a pattern Facebook three and a

266
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,730
half ipods three years AOL two and a

267
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,900
half years how about draw something how

268
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,300
long did draw something take to get to

269
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:20,040
50 million users six months anybody else

270
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,479
drop something it's a stupid game from a

271
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,099
few years back where you actually like

272
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,529
draw something you have to get the other

273
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,730
person at the other end of the game to

274
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:31,800
actually guess what you're drawing

275
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:34,100
stupid game that stupid game took 50

276
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,990
days to get the 50 million users a

277
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:41,009
stupid little drawing game angry birds

278
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:42,560
space 35 days to get the 50 million

279
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:45,360
users from the time they released it

280
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:50,119
what we're seeing is as technology moves

281
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,680
forward things are going way way faster

282
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,420
so for those of you that have seen that

283
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:59,939
me present this slide before I added

284
00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:03,240
something not only are things growing

285
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:05,699
faster how faster they stop it how fast

286
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,589
are they dying okay so that's the

287
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:10,079
question how quickly did these fall and

288
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:12,569
what replaced them right the pace of the

289
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,729
climb is matching the pace of the

290
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:17,250
eventual fall so let's take a quick

291
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:18,839
think through this right telephone I

292
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,279
don't I don't have a landline telephone

293
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,019
anymore right so the concept of a

294
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:26,610
landline telephone anyways is dying or

295
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:30,329
dead radio anybody have a radio outside

296
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:33,500
of their car two people raise their

297
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:33,500
hands three people there you go

298
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,360
television I cut the cord four years ago

299
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,980
right I'm streaming everything now so

300
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,389
the basic concept is being replaced

301
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:47,880
there I intentionally skip intentionally

302
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:49,829
skipped the web and Facebook because I

303
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,720
think these two are in that middle phase

304
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:54,120
right now when they die they are going

305
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,430
to die a horrid F and it's going to be

306
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,810
fast but right now they're still living

307
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:02,069
and they're still growing strong so I've

308
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:03,599
skipped those ipod that died real fast

309
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:06,360
when the iphone came up the concept of

310
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,730
an ipod was just gone nobody uses ipods

311
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,060
anymore AOL when we all know what

312
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:13,680
happened to hillel and of course these

313
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,630
last two games i don't know is anybody

314
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,508
in here have either draw something or

315
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:21,120
angry birds space on the phone today one

316
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:22,560
person it's definitely far short short

317
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,300
of the 50 million that joined in the

318
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,920
first 30 days right so the point is it's

319
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,569
the curves go like this now things

320
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,819
change so fast they go from zero to a

321
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:34,299
high

322
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:36,368
hundreds of zero in no time flat and so

323
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:40,419
when we start to look at that what does

324
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:42,729
that mean for your business okay well

325
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:45,249
that means that if you want to do things

326
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:47,289
right in how you're doing your business

327
00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:49,389
how you're building your technology how

328
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:50,979
you're building your software you have

329
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:53,919
to do it at the pace of the rest of the

330
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:56,799
world okay it's no longer ok to do a

331
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,329
24-month release cycle on a piece of

332
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,059
software and be like here you go here's

333
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:02,829
your six new features from two years ago

334
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:05,469
you'll never sell you'll never nobody

335
00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:06,998
will ever buy it from you so let's look

336
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:10,029
at a few examples of folks that have

337
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:11,829
embraced this etsy over fifty deploys a

338
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:13,569
day right and that was about three or

339
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:16,779
four years ago when they head back those

340
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:19,059
numbers amazon deploys the production on

341
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:22,119
average every eleven point six seconds

342
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:26,499
into their own systems that's absolutely

343
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:28,059
astonishing facebook minimum of bi

344
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:29,649
weekly updates but i would argue it's

345
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:31,029
actually way more than that because my

346
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:32,079
brother actually works there and i

347
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:33,459
believe he told me they pushed to

348
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,738
production at least two to three times a

349
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:39,159
day worldwide into Facebook's

350
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:40,989
infrastructure Adobe sixty percent

351
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:42,789
increase in app delivery rate when they

352
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:46,929
added DevOps platforms to their to their

353
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:48,639
environment sony pictures they cut down

354
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:50,949
their month-long delivery time two

355
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,739
minutes by adding devops concepts and

356
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:55,089
fidelity reduce the release time from

357
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:58,299
two to three days to two to three hours

358
00:14:55,089 --> 00:15:00,009
okay that's how fast our technology

359
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:02,769
world is going now that's how fast our

360
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:05,979
business is going now and security

361
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:10,149
cannot possibly go slow if security goes

362
00:15:05,979 --> 00:15:11,859
slow security will cease to exist so

363
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:14,679
there's a term thrown about in business

364
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:17,739
circles called agility it's a business

365
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:20,079
agility it refers to distinct qualities

366
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:21,819
that allow an entity to respond rapidly

367
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,998
to changes in the internal and external

368
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:28,539
environment without losing momentum or

369
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:31,269
vision again comes down to speed of

370
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:36,249
change okay how quickly you can adapt to

371
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:37,329
the situation but let's talk about that

372
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:39,339
what does it mean for business and what

373
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:41,858
does it mean for technology okay well

374
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:43,359
for business that means when we're doing

375
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:44,620
startups I sit on the board of a couple

376
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,390
different startups

377
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,700
Advisors on boards for a couple

378
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:50,530
different startups and I mentor gosh

379
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,380
probably a half a dozen at least other

380
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:55,480
young startups in how to build their

381
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,980
company quickly okay so I like that I do

382
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,930
both the business side on the tech side

383
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,640
and at the end of the day the first

384
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:03,250
thing every startup has to do is find

385
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,260
product market fit okay they have to go

386
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,150
from having nothing to creating a

387
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,700
product that the market wants to buy and

388
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:12,220
they have to do that fast to do that

389
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:15,640
they have to do what we call fail fast

390
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,800
and iterate quickly okay so what we mean

391
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,840
by that is come up with your idea take

392
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,339
it to a potential customer find out

393
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,560
what's wrong with it throw it away

394
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,200
create a new one do it again until you

395
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,569
get that product market fit and if

396
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,280
you're lucky you can take off okay and

397
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:33,160
this is a sense of what we call the lean

398
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,819
business model even big companies can

399
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,350
embrace this model i started a

400
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,570
intrapreneurial venture inside a very

401
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:42,730
coated number of years back around the

402
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,650
mobile security space okay and that was

403
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,300
what it amounts to is a startup company

404
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,650
inside of a larger company right so

405
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,800
there's lots of different ways that this

406
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:52,660
business division can be achieved how

407
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,420
does the technology world achieve these

408
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:58,780
same exact goals how does the security

409
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:00,849
space get into a situation where they

410
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,500
can find product market fit for their

411
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,750
concepts their technologies their ideas

412
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,310
okay that's the way we have to

413
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:10,630
fundamentally be thinking differently as

414
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:12,490
security people okay there's a few a few

415
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,500
things that i recommend here first thing

416
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:18,400
is security people have to embrace

417
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:21,460
change if you don't embrace change it's

418
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,590
going to go around you okay you can't be

419
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:26,140
a blocker in this environment anymore

420
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:28,089
and you have to push to production and

421
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,620
you have to push your changes frequently

422
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,659
to be able to keep up with the pace of

423
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:37,179
change of the rest of the world that

424
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:39,010
we've seen data and visibility is

425
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:41,020
paramount to success I mentioned before

426
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,970
about breaking down silos the easiest

427
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:46,330
way to break down silos is to provide

428
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:49,390
data across teams across groups across

429
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:51,610
function so that everybody has all data

430
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,920
giving them that collaborative curve

431
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:56,260
effect and of course you have to be able

432
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,880
to respond quickly for you guys well

433
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,450
almost all of this is achieved with

434
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,400
cloud

435
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,410
almost all of this will be achieved with

436
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,390
devops almost all of this will be

437
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,580
achieved with fundamentally changing how

438
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:09,370
you approach security from the heart of

439
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,020
what you're doing so cloud gives you

440
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:13,629
everything as a service workloads verse

441
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,820
processes rapid prototyping and Minimum

442
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,170
Viable products okay and these a lot of

443
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:21,040
these are actually business terms that

444
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:23,230
help companies get better well I I have

445
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,360
a concept i call Minimum Viable security

446
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:28,950
and this is the point at which many

447
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:32,439
security guys actually boo me and many

448
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:35,170
business / technology folks think it's a

449
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,030
really good idea Minimum Viable security

450
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:38,950
is instead of coming and creating

451
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,930
technologies products processes and

452
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,780
procedures that are super locked down

453
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:46,240
and super secure instead of like

454
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:49,149
focusing on that end of it focus on the

455
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,160
end of getting business done and adding

456
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:53,950
only the minimum level of security

457
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,570
required to meet your needs from a risk

458
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,280
perspective don't come at it the other

459
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:59,649
way don't lock it down and then loosen

460
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,399
it up until work gets done because

461
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:05,080
you're a blocker you're in the way and

462
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,120
so when you do that when you come at it

463
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,370
from the vantage point of hey I'm going

464
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,149
to be as wide open as I possibly can you

465
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:16,000
begin to live on the edge of chaos and

466
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:18,580
it's scary it's really freaking scary

467
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,820
okay if you're if you're super safe on

468
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,470
the left you die okay you can't get

469
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,899
anything done your business dies if

470
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:28,420
you're wide open on the right your own

471
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,190
your hacked your business dies right so

472
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,630
there's a balance point but I would

473
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,670
argue instead of coming at it from the

474
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,650
side of safety on the Left come at it

475
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:37,990
from the side of chaos on the right and

476
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:41,050
embrace that chaos and be okay with that

477
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:42,670
chaos so that's a new hashtag everybody

478
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:47,950
needs to use edge of chaos or edge of

479
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:52,000
security chaos yet security remains

480
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:54,790
static nothing's really changed and how

481
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,730
we do security to the point where it's

482
00:19:54,790 --> 00:20:00,850
just insane how slowly we're making

483
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,020
changes in the security space again

484
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,820
here's here's the point of contention

485
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,710
that I have lots of discussions on those

486
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,770
people but the root of all evil and

487
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:11,500
security lies in exactly two locations

488
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:14,530
errors in code that's one and

489
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:17,020
and business processes that's it that's

490
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:20,200
all there is you either can fix the code

491
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:22,570
and fix the problem or you can fix the

492
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,000
process that put the error in the code

493
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:27,340
in the first place right so take for

494
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,380
example sequel injection sequel

495
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,510
injection has been a known attack class

496
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,850
for I don't know how long yet we still

497
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:36,340
aren't anywhere close to fixing the

498
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:38,050
problem if we can put in input

499
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,659
validation into every piece of code we

500
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:42,909
write we can fix the problem aka we fix

501
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,620
the code it fixes the problem the other

502
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:47,620
way we can fix it is to actually have a

503
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:49,330
process that people use to fix the code

504
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:54,550
the right way these are the two two

505
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:56,949
sides and two pieces of security so the

506
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:59,200
verizon debe ir which everybody is

507
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,850
intimately familiar with shows that

508
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,790
percentage and count of attacks that

509
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:08,350
resulted in data breaches web attacks

510
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:10,090
were forty percent of breaches web

511
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,480
attacks are nothing new I was a

512
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:16,360
penetration tester starting in 2001

513
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:20,230
doing web attacks around 2003 breaking

514
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:23,820
sequel injection in 2003 it's been 13

515
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:27,430
years why have we not fixed this problem

516
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:29,860
it's a big issue so I'm going to focus

517
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:31,570
the rest of the section on app sec okay

518
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,219
but again as I mentioned beginning of

519
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:36,429
the talk you can apply the ideas the

520
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:39,220
concepts the agility the speed etc also

521
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:42,760
the network security or to wireless

522
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:45,420
security etc so let's talk about the

523
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,920
traditional app sec technology stack

524
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,990
manual assessments okay that's where it

525
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,540
kind of all began right manual

526
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:54,820
assessments late 90s I just picked three

527
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,230
from my history I worked for at stake

528
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,169
which is on the list actually three of

529
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:01,030
the four keynote speakers you have this

530
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:04,330
week all work for at stake back in the

531
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:06,850
late 90s early 2000s this is hackers for

532
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:10,060
hire right having hackers break into

533
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:12,129
places then we saw innovation around

534
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:15,070
dynamic application security testing

535
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:17,320
okay automated scanners automating what

536
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,840
the humans do and scanning for

537
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,600
vulnerabilities a few big names in that

538
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,449
we're web inspect spy dynamic sanctum

539
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,980
again to early 2000s right right

540
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:31,630
through about two thousand four when

541
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:35,710
when sanctum was acquired by HP or IBM

542
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:38,590
HP I think web application firewalls

543
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:40,929
okay those were kind of new and invented

544
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:44,830
around the mid 2000s mid modsecurity 02

545
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:47,649
imperva 04 incapsula 2011 right some

546
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:49,510
pretty cool innovation even though they

547
00:22:47,649 --> 00:22:52,840
don't really work but we could set that

548
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:56,200
aside and then fast right this was kind

549
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,970
of a mid 2000s the static analysis of

550
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,649
software right looking at the source

551
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:01,809
code and looking at the binary code and

552
00:22:59,649 --> 00:23:02,918
these dates are estimates these are just

553
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:04,690
looking through when companies were

554
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:06,460
formed or wind products were released

555
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,080
but the point is there really hasn't

556
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:11,620
been any innovation since about two

557
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,470
thousand six 2008 time frame cost a

558
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:17,018
decade of nothing no change in the apps

559
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:19,659
tech market in the app sex space that

560
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:22,080
really sucks we've really not done

561
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:24,159
anything different in the last 10 years

562
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,519
we've kind of entered what I call an

563
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:31,539
innovation black hole so let's talk

564
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:36,760
about why these things fail okay manual

565
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:39,730
assessment humans are expensive they're

566
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,889
not cheap one human is way more than

567
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,480
what a what a typical tool would cost

568
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:46,769
you to run and implement these days and

569
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:50,080
their error-prone they're inconsistent

570
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:51,519
they're slow humans in general when

571
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,789
you're talking about a repetitive task

572
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,889
are far from optimal and so we learned

573
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:59,139
early on during manual penetration

574
00:23:56,889 --> 00:24:00,908
testing that pretty much the optimal

575
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:03,279
time frame for any kind of security work

576
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:05,169
from a consultancy with 22 consultants

577
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,250
for two weeks I don't know how many of

578
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:08,289
you are consultants or heard of that

579
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:10,389
term but it was two guys two weeks every

580
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:11,980
project hey what do you think how long

581
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:14,500
is it going to take to break into the

582
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:16,659
into the president's office two guys two

583
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,700
weeks everything two guys two weeks and

584
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:21,519
we did it we did it for a long time but

585
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,049
it was so inconsistent we did two guys

586
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:24,909
two weeks six months later we'd be

587
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:26,740
brought back to that same place they say

588
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:28,870
we fixed all the problems if they

589
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,279
bothered and we'd say good give us two

590
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:33,250
guys two weeks and we'd get in again

591
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:36,549
okay it just didn't scale and it was

592
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:38,320
very expensive so then the world came up

593
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:39,129
with dynamic application security

594
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,990
testing

595
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:43,960
as I mentioned before and they said okay

596
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,250
if these guys cost a lot of money and

597
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,280
they're really inconsistent and what

598
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:50,290
they find let's find let's automate them

599
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,740
let's let's create tools that automate

600
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:55,899
those humans great idea okay the problem

601
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,640
became that it's a quick and dirty scam

602
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:01,090
that was false negative false positive

603
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:04,180
prone that dropped a mountain of issues

604
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:06,100
on the desk of the sea so a binder like

605
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,480
this would get literally get dropped on

606
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,310
the desk of the sea so and the sea so

607
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,380
would be overwhelmed and say holy smokes

608
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:14,260
yeah I'm going to take these first four

609
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,430
pages and that's all I care about so

610
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,650
that really didn't work either it

611
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:20,230
increased the workload of the security

612
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:21,520
analyst within the company which you

613
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:25,000
know sure it made things a little bit

614
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,620
more secure but again it ended up

615
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,470
costing a lot of money to do it right

616
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,600
and not only that but multi-step attacks

617
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:33,700
were not possible with dynamic scanners

618
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,320
okay so i call them business logic

619
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,960
attacks multi-step attacks where you

620
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,429
have to follow a human's logic you can

621
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,630
never get through all the way through

622
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:42,700
the number of steps so you can never

623
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:44,950
guarantee code coverage you can never

624
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,400
guarantee by pointing a scanner at a web

625
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:52,630
app that it assessed the entire web app

626
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:54,130
so death okay whatever so we said okay

627
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,630
you know what we're not going to try to

628
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,830
look for flaws we're going to block them

629
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:58,090
instead and we're going to put the web

630
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:03,480
application firewall them into

631
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:05,409
production Wow was that a mistake web

632
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,900
application firewalls kind of came

633
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:10,450
around because of PCI and because it was

634
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,970
a mandated checkbox otherwise that that

635
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:15,040
market may not have ever actually taken

636
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,720
off and existed because nobody runs a

637
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,399
web application firewall in protection

638
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,440
mode they all run it in what we call

639
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,270
auditor mode which basically means it

640
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,950
doesn't block anything till the auditor

641
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:25,450
comes in they flip it into blocking mode

642
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,520
for the 10 minutes the auditors there

643
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:31,000
and then they turn it back off because

644
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:33,879
it breaks all the things okay West broke

645
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,740
everything so nobody used them they were

646
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,920
a big problem yet it turned into a

647
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:45,790
multi-billion dollar market because of

648
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:49,420
regulation so enter saft the holy grail

649
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:51,250
right the touring problem the hey we're

650
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,999
going to look at every bit and byte in

651
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,619
your line in line of code or

652
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:55,939
every bit and byte in your binary and

653
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:58,999
we're going to show you every single

654
00:26:55,939 --> 00:27:01,999
vulnerability that's depth in there as

655
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:04,519
this this this meme really kind of

656
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:07,249
throws out there it is a hard problem it

657
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:09,109
is a really hard problem so again it

658
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:13,069
became false negative false positive

659
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:15,259
prone okay just something that it kind

660
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:18,019
of works it gives you flaws but it's

661
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:21,139
really really hard to do well and it

662
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:22,849
takes forever right so you would feed

663
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,498
back you would feed your entire code

664
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:26,269
base through the engine and out would

665
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:29,059
pop again a book of things that you had

666
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:32,389
to then handle many of which weren't

667
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:35,869
real or were incorrect but it would take

668
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:37,369
two days four days a week to run an

669
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:39,649
entire code base through through the

670
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:41,149
detection engine well how does that work

671
00:27:39,649 --> 00:27:43,639
when we're talking about speed to market

672
00:27:41,149 --> 00:27:45,438
how does that resolve against 50 pushes

673
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:47,238
a day when you're at sea or when you're

674
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:49,759
pushing into production of every 11

675
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:54,469
seconds when your Amazon SAS doesn't

676
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:55,849
work anymore so I stole some data from

677
00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:58,719
force there as since I used to be a

678
00:27:55,849 --> 00:28:01,458
Forrester analyst I hope they don't mind

679
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:03,799
this is actually security technology

680
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:05,089
adoption this report came out a week ago

681
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:06,679
actually I think it came out in the

682
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:10,339
summer the data is from the summer the

683
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:11,959
report came out a week ago in 2013 this

684
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:13,938
were the percentages of enterprises that

685
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:17,209
were interviewed to actually use these

686
00:28:13,939 --> 00:28:19,039
technologies so in 2013 again remember

687
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:20,659
we've had almost an eight to ten year

688
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,259
black hole of innovation that should be

689
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:26,299
plenty for a market to take off in Excel

690
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:28,699
roughly thirty percent use any of these

691
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:30,529
given tools it's not many but that was

692
00:28:28,699 --> 00:28:33,679
2013 right so maybe twenty thirteen to

693
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:36,439
twenty sixteen things got better not

694
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,819
really not really we had four percent

695
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:39,709
here five percent there we're still

696
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:43,039
talking less than a third of enterprises

697
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:46,549
use any of these tools so problems their

698
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:51,289
problems not solved and it's just not

699
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:53,149
fixing so my friend Rick Holland who

700
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:56,689
used to work at Forrester no works at

701
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:59,928
digital shadows he coined a term expense

702
00:28:56,689 --> 00:29:02,359
in depth which I love so what do the

703
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:05,359
best enterprises do today they buy all

704
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:06,590
of these tools put them into a knapsack

705
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,770
stack

706
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:11,959
and still don't get security its expense

707
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,760
in depth it's the multi-layered approach

708
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,390
to ensuring minimal return on your

709
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:19,460
investment which is every every CEOs

710
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:21,559
dream right spend a lot of money and get

711
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:23,870
nothing for it well that's essentially

712
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:25,879
what happened in the abstract space okay

713
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:29,600
and so here I am I've just spent the

714
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:32,299
last 30 minutes disparaging all of the

715
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:36,379
work that you guys do so where do we go

716
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:39,889
from here okay how do we fix the problem

717
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,909
okay well let's go back to the stuff I

718
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,950
was talking about the beginning of the

719
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:44,570
conversation guys let's go back to the

720
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:48,440
business and how the business has

721
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:50,389
shifted underneath us okay security must

722
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,159
apply the learnings of modern modern

723
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:55,039
successful business practices to

724
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,919
security programs and processes okay and

725
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,510
when you apply those learnings you're

726
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,850
going to see why things aren't working

727
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:03,799
today I don't have answers I'm not going

728
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:05,539
to tell you you go back to your offices

729
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:07,158
click this button click that button

730
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:08,570
you're going to be instantly secure what

731
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:10,340
I'm trying to get you guys to think it's

732
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:12,918
how to switch your mindset think think

733
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:14,980
of things a little bit differently so we

734
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:17,720
open with decentralization and mobility

735
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,580
how can we apply that to the apps tech

736
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,730
program how can we apply that to your

737
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:26,559
security programs okay decentralized

738
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:28,730
control kind of a dream the dream for

739
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,610
application security is for it to kind

740
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:34,460
of disappear for it to live within every

741
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:37,399
development group so decentralize your

742
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:40,220
authority live on the edge of security

743
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:43,639
chaos be okay with hey there might be

744
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:45,260
flaws pushed into production be okay

745
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,630
with that figure out how to respond

746
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:50,210
rapidly to that and decentralize your

747
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:52,039
authority and become security mobile so

748
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:54,380
that every person in every group within

749
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:58,610
your organization is responsible for

750
00:30:54,380 --> 00:31:01,039
security second piece of business if

751
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:04,789
they want to go fast with the curve of

752
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:07,070
adoption and crash being so rapid and so

753
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:08,840
steep if your security doesn't go fast

754
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,360
you will never keep up with the pace of

755
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,699
change of your business and technology

756
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:16,969
so security must increase the speed of

757
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:19,399
decisions and execution you can't think

758
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:20,029
about your answers embrace the edge of

759
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:23,439
chaos

760
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:25,940
and be okay with making that decision

761
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,429
making it quickly and being okay to fail

762
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:35,570
fast and instantly respond to that

763
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:39,979
failure security must provide visibility

764
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:42,158
to all okay don't keep your security

765
00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:46,700
data siloed within your security team

766
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:48,320
spread it out this is a photo of one of

767
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:51,619
the signal sciences customers actually

768
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,749
within their developer bullpen they've

769
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:56,059
got all this data they added signal

770
00:31:53,749 --> 00:31:58,099
Sciences carousel or whatever you want

771
00:31:56,059 --> 00:32:00,139
to call these data output screens to

772
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:03,439
their to their developer bullpen during

773
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:05,238
their pilot and it was displaying all

774
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,159
sorts of attacks in real time and it was

775
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:09,440
displaying all sorts of anomaly data in

776
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:12,679
real time and they went to take it down

777
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,599
post pilot and the developers threw a

778
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:17,059
fit they were like hey man we use that

779
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:19,549
information all the time because when we

780
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:22,158
push to production five six times a day

781
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:24,889
if we see a spike in 500 errors if we

782
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,259
see a hackers targeting certain

783
00:32:24,889 --> 00:32:29,119
subsections of the application we can

784
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:32,179
focus our response and we can increase

785
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:33,769
our speed okay so what we found was that

786
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:36,769
providing security data to the

787
00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:38,719
development team helps everybody it

788
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:44,119
helps security and it helps the

789
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:45,729
developers become more effective but you

790
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:49,849
can't just provide them the raw data

791
00:32:45,729 --> 00:32:51,559
like this okay people don't have time to

792
00:32:49,849 --> 00:32:53,869
look through that they don't they don't

793
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:55,549
want to dig into the numbers they need

794
00:32:53,869 --> 00:32:57,678
something that's actionable so that on

795
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:59,479
the right there is some some grass room

796
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,299
from our tool that we've written it's

797
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:05,089
hell of a lot easier to see attacks

798
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:06,559
visually graphically okay and so what

799
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:08,059
you see on the right is spikes and

800
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:11,479
anomalies and attacks on a production

801
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:14,149
web system okay that stands out as a

802
00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:16,099
problem hey somebody is targeting us

803
00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:18,099
with a bunch of attacks that are

804
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:20,718
resulting in anomalies on our web server

805
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:23,269
that's a lot more easy to understand and

806
00:33:20,719 --> 00:33:25,789
read than this and what we found is when

807
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:27,830
we present our developers with that data

808
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:31,839
they can make it actionable and make

809
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:31,839
quick decisions and and move fast

810
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:39,600
so security must increase collaboration

811
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:43,050
between individuals and teams eventually

812
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,389
becoming a part of the culture it's not

813
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:48,000
really about having a security team

814
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,200
anymore if you have a security team in

815
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,780
the traditional sense you're not

816
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:55,140
decentralized it's about making security

817
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:56,610
invisible it's about creating security

818
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:58,920
that's embedded right into the hearts of

819
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:00,209
every person in the company and we've

820
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,980
been talking about this I've been

821
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:05,220
talking about this concept for 20 years

822
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,780
it is hard to do okay you're not going

823
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,970
to go home and just flip a switch and

824
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:11,310
make everybody responsible for security

825
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:13,560
but that should be your underlying theme

826
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:16,110
that should be your underlying vision

827
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,520
for your group for your firm and for

828
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:19,919
your enterprise if you want security

829
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,259
security has to be part of the culture

830
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:25,379
and you can infuse that culture with

831
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,909
rewards so so we take for example etsy

832
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:28,830
as an example of the founders of my

833
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:31,080
company come from Etsy and what they did

834
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:33,480
to infuse security into their overall

835
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,310
culture was giveaway really cool funky

836
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,899
t-shirts anytime somebody found a bug

837
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:38,250
reported a bug whether it was security

838
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:40,560
related or not they got a really cool

839
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:42,510
bug t-shirt and what that starts to do

840
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,279
is it starts to get people outside of

841
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:47,250
the security group and security team

842
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:51,360
thinking about security that's what they

843
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:53,940
need to be doing and so at the end of

844
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:56,879
the day security must embrace life on

845
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,260
the edge of chaos it's not such a

846
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,240
horrible place to live after all I've

847
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:05,520
lived on it for a long time I kind of

848
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:08,850
like it and many times were going to

849
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,980
feel like that guy right but what's

850
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:12,569
really neat if you're going to feel this

851
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,910
way for a long time when you when you

852
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:16,770
look in a Gokhale man i'm letting my

853
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:18,480
engineers push 50 times a day there is

854
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:20,040
going to be so many bugs in our

855
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,130
environment there's going to be so many

856
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,450
hacks attacking you know what it's going

857
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:27,900
to feel like this when you let that

858
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:30,720
happen but in reality that's the same

859
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:33,420
rock just from a different angle okay

860
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,879
somebody took the picture from a

861
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,590
different vantage point okay so it's

862
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,010
about finding the right vantage point to

863
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:42,180
view your reality this is a rock I

864
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,650
forget where it's located but if you

865
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,740
take the photo from up above it looks

866
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,990
like you're hanging off of it

867
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:49,509
thousand foot cliff okay same photo same

868
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:50,439
rock different vantage point and that's

869
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:53,230
the way I want you to think about

870
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,360
security take a different vantage point

871
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:57,850
take a different way of looking at how

872
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,260
you do security hang from the rock be

873
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:03,100
okay with it and if you fall hopefully

874
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:05,110
you're only going to fall a few feet so

875
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:08,890
it's time to change decentralize

876
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:13,360
mobilize your security program go faster

877
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:15,220
become an enabler say yes not know or at

878
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,020
least say how can we do that for you

879
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,149
even if it's not an immediate yes at

880
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:21,250
least consider saying okay let's think

881
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:23,140
about how to get there for you break

882
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,450
down silos share share data and

883
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:28,650
collaborate because that's going to

884
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:31,089
infuse the culture for your company

885
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,740
demystify security data knowledge is

886
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:35,080
power give your entire company that

887
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:39,430
knowledge use the collaboration curve

888
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:41,710
not the experience curve at the end of

889
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:44,109
day become invisible security wins when

890
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:46,740
it ceases to exist it's kind of like the

891
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:49,150
usual suspects Kaiser soshe right he

892
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,618
nobody knew he existed until the very

893
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:52,810
very end right so if you can do that

894
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:55,990
with your security team that that's the

895
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:59,410
ultimate triumph and embrace life at the

896
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:01,330
edge of security chaos and that's me and

897
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:02,980
I wish you all good luck taking some of

898
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:07,109
these thoughts and processes back your

899
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,109
firm's thank you very much for time

900
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:16,549
you

901
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:16,549
