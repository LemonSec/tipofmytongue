3
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:29,329
so thank you I move about a bit and

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,650
that's because it's the last day and you

5
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,390
might have had a good night last night

6
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:36,320
so I need to keep you awake it's better

7
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:38,090
than looking after lunch so you're

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,190
looking at newbie phantom guy and

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,109
literally four days in and I haven't you

10
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,339
means headquarters yet so our peer

11
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:47,780
presenting but sort of the plug Auto

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,609
orchestration and automation but I'm not

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:53,329
here to plug product I'm here to help

14
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:56,539
with the process of the unexpected and

15
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:59,449
data breach resilience basically so it's

16
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:00,469
a management track multi technical you

17
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:03,108
know I'm not going to go down into

18
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:06,440
reverse engineering malware sorry this

19
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:08,450
is all about how to position your

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,090
organization yourself and how to measure

21
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:18,830
your ability to respond to the

22
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:22,490
unexpected okay if I push a button I'm

23
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:24,679
pushing a button well there it is Bink

24
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:28,009
okay okay so I'll do this all the time

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,050
when I'm asleep so wakes you up so why

26
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,720
don't I see I'm going this is why I'm

27
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:35,720
trying to do I've got 25 slides and

28
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,160
basically 44 minutes so no falling

29
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,370
asleep because I've got to move fast on

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,750
it but obviously what I want to try and

31
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,610
do is show you how you can present

32
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,410
security difficulty a lot of times

33
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,420
you've probably heard we need to

34
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,670
translate security terms into business

35
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,710
terms and for anybody who's tried to

36
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,480
explain security to somebody or splain

37
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,970
something new you have to put it in

38
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,270
terms that resonate with them and so

39
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,140
this is a model that will help that one

40
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,660
of the things I found really interesting

41
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,790
I've been I've worked in multiple

42
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,050
industries providing security and I've

43
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,539
always learned something new whether it

44
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:10,519
was telco or manufacturing or critical

45
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:12,140
infrastructure or law enforcement all of

46
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:14,000
these things are given me insight into a

47
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,220
new way of thinking about doing this and

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,690
this was something I saw that was very

49
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,770
very valve and I thought it's a new way

50
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:23,020
of presenting effectively how resilient

51
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,290
you are okay

52
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,310
I wanted to make you think so and know

53
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,079
you might have had a good night last

54
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,080
night I want the brain cells to be

55
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,430
moving a little bit okay and it's all

56
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,830
about trying to get executive support

57
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,690
because we need the businesses to

58
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,370
understand what we need to do and we

59
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,410
need them to understand why we keep

60
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,290
coming to them saying we need to do this

61
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:47,829
it never stopped anybody completed their

62
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:49,810
security vision everybody finish the lit

63
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,750
projects and they've run out no there's

64
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,250
always more for us to do okay and the

65
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,110
other thing about connecting logical

66
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:58,750
security with physicals here I'm not

67
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,940
talking converge security that dream

68
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,770
where we run together

69
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,150
the guards are running out there in the

70
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,540
car parks and you're sitting there with

71
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,250
a mouse I've done that to be honest they

72
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:13,120
they have their guns and you have a

73
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:15,100
mouse it's not very intimidating so you

74
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,970
know that but rarely you know when I

75
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,630
talk about the known and the unknown

76
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,710
this is your worst case scenario

77
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,840
typically nowadays you're implementing

78
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,730
technologies which protect you against

79
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,250
known things you build your socks your

80
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:30,040
sit your your process flows your

81
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,200
playbooks based on the fact you know

82
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,459
something hopefully it's going to block

83
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,170
before you have to do anything that

84
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,610
automation whether it's signatures or

85
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,100
bomb threats or any of that sort of

86
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,350
stuff so rarely if you're in a good

87
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,299
place what you're now doing is having

88
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:47,739
lots of fun and looking for the unknowns

89
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:49,420
which if you don't know you'll miss as I

90
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,510
presented here three times and I always

91
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,630
say ignorance is not bliss for security

92
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,980
people we need to know everything right

93
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:00,299
and the other problem is that sometimes

94
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:04,299
our processes fail nothing is perfect

95
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:06,430
unknown will get through because we

96
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,950
can't control everything and we have to

97
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:11,170
have the mechanism so all my sort of

98
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:13,179
philosophy about having soft teams and

99
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,890
stuff like that is all about how to

100
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,560
prepare for the unknown I can have some

101
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:20,289
good ideas of swimlanes and process

102
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,410
flows etc but it's all about detecting

103
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:27,310
the unknown and reacting appropriately

104
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:28,570
so I heard this talk there's a look at

105
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,670
the organization that are they having

106
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,710
cameras are called InfraGard it's all

107
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,669
FBI physical security people and I go

108
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,159
there because it's kind of interesting

109
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:38,560
and I learn things and this was cost

110
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,810
University of Massachusetts and they had

111
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,520
the FBI in the FEMA team presenting this

112
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,050
and it's just fascinating thing and I

113
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,090
thought that but they will talked about

114
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,250
how they could you know stop flooding

115
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,690
and stuff like that and I thought a lot

116
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,520
of this resonates with how I want to

117
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,530
talk to the executives about and I want

118
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,520
to give records of something tangible to

119
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:59,260
think about now why do I talk about this

120
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,700
that's me somebody said I need to update

121
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,520
my photograph so I look different from

122
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:06,610
that I'm aged a little bit grayer but

123
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,950
what the hell 74 years ago but I've been

124
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,380
doing IT for a long time I'm a geek I'm

125
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,760
a recovering developer I hate

126
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,659
programming that I learn the language a

127
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,820
year I don't know why and to be honest

128
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,980
nowadays you need to have Python list as

129
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,540
I hate Python as well I hate indenting

130
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,370
and tabs and all that crud is like

131
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,880
doesn't hate it but it's a necessary

132
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:30,640
evil I've done lots of development I

133
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,750
have been a DJ yes I'm not going to mix

134
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,950
when these days I'm going to terminate

135
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:37,090
countermeasures with my whole mixed deck

136
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:39,760
and think to DJ a presentation and the

137
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,780
audio people just hate me but so I've

138
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,920
done that I've done a fair amount of

139
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,239
security in a variety of different

140
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,250
environments with a variety of different

141
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,660
organizations these are the last ones

142
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,910
but I've also at the small ones over at

143
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,190
the small incidents all the same rules

144
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,330
apply so that's why in my peer talking

145
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,910
to you because I want to share my

146
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:58,150
experience my knowledge and help you I'm

147
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:00,070
a mentor I created I don't know I think

148
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,280
12 ceases now why they want to become

149
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:05,710
CSIS I have no idea don't do it

150
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,489
I've been fortune five see so critical

151
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,680
all that sort of stuff

152
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,480
it's a journey but some people think

153
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,070
that's fee but what happens is you

154
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,260
become a seasoned and afterwards after

155
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,900
you've done your tour of duty you get

156
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:21,849
back to being normal

157
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:24,520
okay so this analysis that they

158
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,960
presented was based upon physical things

159
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,240
these are actual pictures of flooding

160
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:31,960
now I know there's a Canada and I

161
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,760
couldn't find a unique picture of a nice

162
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,870
storm because there's too many of them

163
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,159
okay all right but this is what they

164
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,470
were basing their knowledge on and this

165
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,410
is the experiences left this was that's

166
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,370
this that's a suite telco telcos not too

167
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:50,030
happy about that

168
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:53,060
right little bit of water damage right

169
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:55,669
obviously transport got hit hard I mean

170
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,440
I was working for a financial exchange

171
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,630
the director of socked down there and

172
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,100
half the subways are closed and you'd

173
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,719
walk around the city and there be huge

174
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,730
generator trucks powering the buildings

175
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,060
for people's apartments for months and

176
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:10,370
months and months amazing

177
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,170
now what's that one too many now it's

178
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,380
not just based upon Hurricane sandy

179
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:17,330
caused lots of issues it disrupted

180
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,670
things now okay we're not to give up

181
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:23,630
forty you know we lucky people don't die

182
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:25,340
typically in our incidents as happy to

183
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,830
say I've never had to lead I on one of

184
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,510
my incidents hopefully much you know you

185
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,740
don't want that to happen but it caused

186
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,450
a lot of things but a lot of these

187
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,669
things eight million people without

188
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,930
power I was talking to some of yes

189
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:37,460
things what happens if our

190
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:41,270
infrastructure disappears how do we

191
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,770
handle that how do we recover right so

192
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,090
they really had problems and they

193
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,010
weren't prepared and they weren't

194
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:49,340
anticipating and we had no way of

195
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:51,110
knowing how effective they were now

196
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,289
because of that they also did for thingy

197
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:58,370
now I'm a Bostonian so I had a car okay

198
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:59,960
I can't do an American accent from love

199
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,750
nor money I've tried for 14 years ago

200
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:06,049
can't do it but I can do a Boston cat in

201
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:09,530
a pack right but they also so bottom by

202
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:12,229
the water and the Seas rising so they're

203
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:15,710
kind of anticipating how the hell do we

204
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:18,590
handle it when Boston floods it's like a

205
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:21,680
great position not when have we being

206
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,090
hacked but we will be hacked what can we

207
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,440
do to be prepared but wouldn't you love

208
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,409
that in your well for the business

209
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:31,010
people and okay you know what we will

210
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:34,460
get act I spent 27 million dollars or

211
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,870
not we won't get hacked so what they did

212
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,180
was they look to this and then they came

213
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:41,179
up with this graph okay math people you

214
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:43,699
must be blogging about this d3 yes I

215
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:45,140
know that's a terrible language what

216
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,280
they did was they had they realized that

217
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,280
it's something if they're flooding

218
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,650
happens that it can happen very quickly

219
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,689
if a hurricane comes sweeping up with a

220
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,490
coast on the East Coast it can actually

221
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,730
create a wave that will flood in

222
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:03,029
literally hours and you need to evacuate

223
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:04,949
evacuate everybody out of that building

224
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:07,379
city think of the building in bloody

225
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:10,829
city but they realized that they had to

226
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:13,980
focus their attention on specific where

227
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:17,069
are my critical points how do I assess

228
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,569
which train stations are most critical

229
00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:22,979
for getting people out of the city

230
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:25,819
because I can't like when the flooding

231
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:28,740
happened in New York City

232
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:30,509
they kind of said well yeah we'll get

233
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,800
boats off people now when 9/11 happened

234
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:34,439
that was a very very unique situation

235
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,660
what happened a call went out to the

236
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:38,750
marine channel saying anybody who's kind

237
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,800
of boats can you get over to the island

238
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,259
pick something up and take them across

239
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,758
to New Jersey so that the American

240
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:49,829
equivalent of d-day you know family who

241
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:52,439
but basically that kind of reaction can

242
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:55,560
be anticipated and I had people saying

243
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:57,480
well we'll use Wi-Fi hotspots and we'll

244
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,290
get a bus across to New Jersey when it

245
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,839
happens again

246
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,490
no you have to map out where you're

247
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,009
critical in so they've started thinking

248
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,930
about this but all these things were

249
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:08,519
like trying to look at how to do it but

250
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:11,069
then they said okay great how do I

251
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,209
measure that how do I know if that's

252
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,128
going to be effective or not that's a

253
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:16,079
great pattern on where the criticality

254
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:18,660
is they know the people that the

255
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,329
locations the demographics they want to

256
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,740
get people those are the how many seven

257
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,508
stations that they're going to focus on

258
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:28,079
making sure they got all the equipment

259
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:29,930
to get to keep it running dry and the

260
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:33,120
trains running out of there impressive

261
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:37,050
so as a result of all these problems

262
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,879
they have opportunities the United

263
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,758
States I had to put us was kind of funny

264
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,290
go put US president in because I'm not

265
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,480
doing yours but they came up this sort

266
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:48,059
of mandate saying that they want

267
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,649
resilience and they always buzzwords and

268
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:52,589
I thought well this I love this this is

269
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:55,529
all security prepare a bats with stands

270
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:56,639
with color attack accidents those other

271
00:10:55,529 --> 00:11:00,809
things that we deal with on a daily

272
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:05,730
basis so that's what they were tasked

273
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:07,949
with doing and so it's it's it's a white

274
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:12,760
paper so you can download it if you want

275
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:14,890
to right but we have a

276
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,700
for anybody's heart there is this gonna

277
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:19,480
hurt

278
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:22,120
watching you busy there was a chip for

279
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,100
prying it's gonna hurt okay

280
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,170
but we have I don't know what the thing

281
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,480
I must know what the thing is but

282
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,099
there's a think but basically you can

283
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,560
get me close out please the drugs in the

284
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:36,790
wall you know we have our own

285
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:39,069
equivalents of flooding of disasters or

286
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:41,469
Poland we've got ransomware I know

287
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:44,020
that's a hot subject here it's not going

288
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:46,300
away it's gonna keep coming I'm sorry

289
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:49,360
it's something because it everything can

290
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,979
get in these doses Akamai's saying

291
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,970
they've seen the larger volumes that

292
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:56,470
Myra think massive volleys and there are

293
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,630
new techniques this there's a new

294
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,700
ideological it's the court of slow as

295
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:05,050
there's a new attack rarely rate one

296
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:07,420
computer can take out ad a firewall by

297
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,280
itself massive file you can hit massive

298
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,930
follow and it just does one little query

299
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:15,220
and for some strange reason the

300
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:16,530
firewalls just going to loop hell it's

301
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,690
just come out with a couple of days ago

302
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:21,280
obviously IOT that's a journey you've

303
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,390
all heard about how you somebody's

304
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,160
worked out how they can put a piece of

305
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,170
malware and I don't wanna be lightbulbs

306
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,209
screw it into the light bulb they're

307
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:31,479
buying it to mesh and then all the other

308
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:34,750
bulbs to you'd wonderful love it and

309
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,190
obviously there's physical security we

310
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,210
have to worry about that in human error

311
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:41,560
so how you feeling seem depressed Jeff

312
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,570
yes is you probably know give it ten

313
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,729
numbers invasion I start you here I'm

314
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,470
making totally depressed and then

315
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,800
hopefully I give you how can this enjoy

316
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,390
at the end that's the idea okay so

317
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:55,060
obviously this is one of my little

318
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,800
things if you want to show you're

319
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,939
successful yet over to measure it and

320
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,560
you have to measure it in terms of

321
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:03,940
resonate with you with that with the

322
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:05,920
business it's a bit like career path if

323
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,620
you have a set of objectives in your

324
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,420
career and is written down hit those

325
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,280
objectives the other things might be

326
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,750
hurting you and you might feel they're

327
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,760
totally passionate and you need to do

328
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,620
them but at the end of the year they're

329
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,020
measuring your performance on those

330
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,610
objects as they wrote down so you

331
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,699
measure things but

332
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:29,140
how to measure security and in a way for

333
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:31,540
executives right this by the NS

334
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:35,260
presentation will mean success to you

335
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:38,349
and to the executives you presenter this

336
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:40,590
is oh my god you are brilliant people

337
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:44,620
you are amazing

338
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:49,180
are you confused yet yes I'm not because

339
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:52,570
I'm presenting right so the other thing

340
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,650
is I was really the external mode of see

341
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,650
sir and they put us on a training course

342
00:13:53,650 --> 00:14:00,760
and they said the human brain can only

343
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:03,250
focus on three things at once right so

344
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,980
you focus on three things and you have

345
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,450
probably missed those three cards there

346
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,770
were three card there and if you were

347
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,360
had a good night last night you're

348
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:13,270
focusing on that straw screw that bubble

349
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,100
is a glass of scotch up top okay but I

350
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,900
always try and break things down into

351
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,280
three because it makes a module now I do

352
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,140
break the rules because I have a three

353
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,699
and another three and a three but the

354
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,800
three things combined together for a

355
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,480
single activity there's kind of the

356
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,280
principle honey and it's a great enabler

357
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,550
for your career and your and everything

358
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:34,240
you want to do so though yeah so anybody

359
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:37,000
wants to go up it's good well see not

360
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,540
too bad a night last night so when they

361
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,650
came up this idea there are five ways of

362
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:49,089
presenting your ability to impact your

363
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:52,540
cyber resilience cushion ability it's

364
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:54,100
not an English word but it kind of

365
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,500
resonates and you can say well our

366
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,210
cushion ability I must be honest I have

367
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,800
yet to present this to an executive and

368
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,570
say well our crew sure the ability

369
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,520
factor is it doesn't quite right but

370
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:08,200
it's a way of presenting it in an idea

371
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:10,569
okay you have resistance now I get a

372
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:14,530
tough time each one of these and thank

373
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:19,540
you for eating robustness logical where

374
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:21,699
doesn't see graceful extension that's a

375
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,050
calming influence animation each between

376
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,839
calm now

377
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:28,750
so those five factors are impact your

378
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,250
ability for cyber resilience so what

379
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,470
I've done is I've got each one of these

380
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,440
slides pretty graphic so it resonates

381
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:37,630
really for the people who are visual I

382
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,310
got key things you need to have in place

383
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,260
from my perspective and this is just the

384
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:43,060
beginning process and three things that

385
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:45,459
you need to be to be proactive if you

386
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,109
have those three things plus these texts

387
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:49,660
and least of these approaches hopefully

388
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:53,310
its resonates with you right so cushion

389
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:56,319
ability in litchi is the cushion how

390
00:15:53,310 --> 00:16:00,518
gracefully can I collapse and not

391
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:05,220
destroy the business all right and for

392
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:08,170
us it's okay if I want to gracefully

393
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:11,560
degrade my service what do I have to do

394
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:13,000
switch off my non-essential services so

395
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,849
like for example I have a situation

396
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,200
where there's a bit of a markup we kind

397
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,329
of shut down the wrong firewall and

398
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,220
school Andrea and what I really want to

399
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:24,670
do is I wanted to shut down to the

400
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:28,300
required services so I needed them to

401
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:31,300
have a rule set in place to actually be

402
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,949
able to say okay I'm being ddosed I need

403
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,229
to shut off all the public Internet but

404
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,270
I think traffic still to go to my to my

405
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:39,279
offices around them around the country

406
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:42,250
around the world and that sort of stuff

407
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,529
I need it also the ability to restore a

408
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,820
lot of people forget that piece taking

409
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:48,670
the firewalls down and dropping them

410
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,899
down or taking down equipment is not a

411
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,490
simple thing in today's world because

412
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:52,930
there's so much interdependencies and

413
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,670
things change in shift between

414
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,199
manufacturing that's a real nightmare

415
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,520
you can't just shut up a serviette do

416
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,470
shut down everything in sequence and

417
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,930
bring it back up in sequence we have

418
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:05,949
that ability of how to define crucian

419
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:08,349
ability and say okay so this is going to

420
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:10,780
affect my ability to degrade my service

421
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:12,099
without destroying the business okay

422
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,069
how's it going so far

423
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:16,119
that we buzzed about crucian ability

424
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:20,020
you're not going to dream about it I

425
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:24,938
hope right he did activate that

426
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:26,980
resistance so this is an interesting one

427
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:28,530
and like something is evolving and it's

428
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,179
something we normally think about

429
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:34,178
redirecting the attack now we do it with

430
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:36,520
DDoS controls with telophase and stuff

431
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:37,000
like that it's kind of a fun journey but

432
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,980
we don't

433
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,720
so for some of the vendors those telcos

434
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,110
they don't like it like it just stay on

435
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,390
all the time because it breaks things

436
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:50,350
but there are new technologies or new

437
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:52,929
strands coming like deception rebranded

438
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:55,299
honey pots it's a bit like how risk

439
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:58,090
management became GRC it's the same

440
00:17:55,299 --> 00:18:00,510
thing but it's improved the detection

441
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:02,678
technologies and allow allow us to

442
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,150
redirect and detect something so they're

443
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:05,590
not attacking that server they think

444
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,120
they're attacking something else I can

445
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:10,389
redirect their attention to something

446
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,949
else but it's an interesting philosophy

447
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,390
we don't necessarily have all the tools

448
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:17,289
and if anybody else has any idea of

449
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:18,220
alternatives but for me there's a couple

450
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:21,610
things also coming up the

451
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:23,799
software-defined network that's a brand

452
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:26,020
thing I can redirect them down people

453
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:29,049
off if I've got a server that's kind of

454
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:30,549
under intense being attacked and put

455
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:32,408
into a zone which got increased

456
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:35,710
protection or increased scrutiny or

457
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:40,720
monitoring and that other stuff DDoS the

458
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:42,990
network team now I must admit for me the

459
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,539
security team and the network team

460
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:49,299
should live together and be happy but a

461
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:53,110
lot of times there's kind of a conflict

462
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:54,580
and the whole thing purely because the

463
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,139
network team and all the operations

464
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,389
teams are all focused on heat

465
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:00,730
everything's up and running it is all

466
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:03,940
green I've got no problems I can sit

467
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:05,919
back and use my terminal to go and

468
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,450
access a website and in fact by my

469
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,390
workstation in the data center I guess

470
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:12,360
about that security operations people

471
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:15,640
wear their worst nightmare

472
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:21,459
because when it's all green what do we

473
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:24,760
think exactly know that is it we look

474
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,530
for problems but when we want to start

475
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,360
sharing information and start working

476
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:30,070
together the network team is a great

477
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,840
enabler because we have the same goals I

478
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:36,428
have a thing that for kind of philosophy

479
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:38,559
about the sooner the closer it gets to

480
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:41,440
the processor the more expensive the

481
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,600
incident so if it's on the server it

482
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,980
costs a lot of money if I can stop it at

483
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,600
the network it's going to cost me less

484
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:50,280
the instance who looks after the network

485
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:52,530
the network team so you obviously need

486
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,810
to have resistance is no point having

487
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:56,399
resistance if you can't detect it so you

488
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,899
have to have detection you also have to

489
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,040
have the respond processes in place

490
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:04,350
right and also for me decision points

491
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,120
and a lot of times when I get

492
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,790
credibility with the business

493
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,739
I'll have predefined decision points so

494
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,139
that they will automatically start

495
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,490
saying yes Paul take this action now

496
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,310
don't bother to ring me at four o'clock

497
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:19,230
in the morning but make sure you start

498
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:21,060
articulating that conversation like okay

499
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,330
if this happens and I want to redirect

500
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:25,710
if I want to if I see somebody trying to

501
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,070
pummel this particular credit card

502
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,260
vendor

503
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,669
do I want to you do something else how

504
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,460
do I want to handle that that sort of

505
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:35,580
thing right can i redirect it can I

506
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:40,740
invoke another salty and this is a

507
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:42,480
honeypot okay see interesting server

508
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,750
this way honey that's perspi a piece of

509
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,520
honey okay I know I'm not a graphics

510
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:51,590
wizard I describe myself as one step

511
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:56,100
above caveman heart okay robustness

512
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:57,510
right hardening we know this right but

513
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,520
the thing is we've all focused on pen

514
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:01,860
testing and patch management and stuff

515
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,060
like that guess what we all know

516
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,639
security is not just about

517
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:08,250
vulnerabilities it's about people making

518
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,410
mistakes process errors apps second that

519
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:13,850
sort of stuff so you have to have the

520
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:16,380
controls in place for having that

521
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:19,770
putting the appropriate controls in the

522
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,210
right place I got thrown out of a panel

523
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:23,129
one time because I said you should never

524
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:27,090
say no straightaway to a business

525
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:28,620
question and they said that's wrong and

526
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,629
say no if you say no they'll just work

527
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,810
around you so it's important to

528
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:36,000
understand what the essential functions

529
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,230
are right and that's how you do your

530
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,740
business risk management I'll talk about

531
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:42,510
bas we do you know what a BIA is yeah

532
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,400
business impact assessment trying to get

533
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,900
them built is a journey unto itself

534
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,000
trying to find good people is very

535
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,410
difficult but it's really important and

536
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,270
especially if you can get the business

537
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,830
to understand that they need to own that

538
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,540
it's a good way of moving the budget

539
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,889
across they get the business impact

540
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:58,740
assessment you get the results

541
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:00,360
that's my budget take a little bit right

542
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,429
and I talked about the vamp threat

543
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,928
defense obviously now we need to move

544
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:05,730
four beyond

545
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:06,960
just endpoint signatures we need to have

546
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,210
mechanism so we're getting proactive

547
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,769
we've seen the threat feeds we're seeing

548
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:13,019
the instant automation orchestration

549
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:14,970
stuff the you know I was just in the

550
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:17,429
machine learning session all this stuff

551
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:19,590
is going to give us a thread but having

552
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:21,809
that at farms correct detection and the

553
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,730
V we also need to be agile in our

554
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:25,830
defense mechanisms as well and that

555
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,179
power we can harden so hardening is not

556
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,980
just hardening the server in doing a

557
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:31,049
hardened but it's also how do we harden

558
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:33,710
so when something does happen we can

559
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:37,850
respond effectively okay

560
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:39,960
redundancy this is really thing you know

561
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,998
elemental capacity I would love their

562
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,690
work elemental capacity but it's just

563
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:47,039
obviously the software used to but the

564
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:48,899
important thing to me sometimes is

565
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,249
sometimes something fails over and we

566
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:52,619
don't know about it because the server

567
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:54,119
team doesn't tell us well the network

568
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:55,350
starts pulling over and you don't have

569
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:57,629
the communications you really interests

570
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,860
that automated failover for your only

571
00:22:57,629 --> 00:23:00,658
infrastructure is important this is

572
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,860
stuff this is this is stuff resumes easy

573
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,940
there's nothing challenging here it's

574
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,850
not like redirection which is a

575
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:09,360
challenge for us but most important

576
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:11,189
thing for me is test it I might have

577
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,719
told you the story about how I had a

578
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:15,929
huge infrastructure of Active Directory

579
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,249
servers across the world and I had a

580
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:19,679
team that used to do security

581
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:22,019
assessments and they went off and with

582
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,460
Microsoft said you cannot backup Active

583
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:23,899
Directory he can't restore he can do

584
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,899
anything

585
00:23:23,899 --> 00:23:29,939
ok so we set up like the that one server

586
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:32,518
over here that was delayed by an hour or

587
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,499
like by 12 hours so it would see the

588
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:36,389
data and hold it so suddenly mucked up

589
00:23:34,499 --> 00:23:37,830
on the central ad Forest he wouldn't

590
00:23:36,389 --> 00:23:41,549
replicate straight across and corrupt

591
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:42,840
that particular backup that's right so

592
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:44,759
my team goes out in the ghetto a site

593
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,809
and they've literally this this data

594
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:50,399
center there's a path from this server

595
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:52,619
to this rack of tapes in this room and

596
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:54,508
it's actually worn out the path it's

597
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:56,850
worn through the plastic floor there no

598
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:59,580
name before what do you think that's a

599
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:02,998
Active Directory server hmm we do

600
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:05,100
backing it up didn't use a backup

601
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:07,799
protection - jeez ok how do you restore

602
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,789
I don't know we just back it up so never

603
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:11,670
knew you had to restore to make sure

604
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:13,590
your text okay

605
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:16,290
graceful extensibility this is going to

606
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:18,629
be our biggest challenge just our

607
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:21,840
ability to make sure the infrastructure

608
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:23,490
can expand and grow and you're pretty

609
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,649
going actually pull what the hell does

610
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:27,150
that have to do with security

611
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,650
remember we're advisors we help the

612
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,550
business when they build architectures

613
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,750
we have to think about this stuff

614
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:33,120
because they might not think about it

615
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,530
the challenges of cloud how we do it if

616
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,419
we get an outage in one part of the

617
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:38,879
world and the cloud providers disappears

618
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:41,130
how do we do that how do I expand for

619
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,340
capacity how do I shift capacity around

620
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:45,870
and with hybrid cloud which seems to be

621
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,449
the new thing every have this

622
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:50,699
realization that having loads of cloud

623
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:52,110
providers is really very expensive it's

624
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,340
actually more expensive than running

625
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:57,719
your own cloud in your infrastructure

626
00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:00,389
and so people gain we're telling it's

627
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,860
been more expensive now hybrid cloud is

628
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,180
the big thing and so now your data can

629
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,500
be bouncing around all over the place so

630
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:07,850
you have to think about that but how

631
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,660
could you leverage the cloud all right

632
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:15,810
automated provisioning all these things

633
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:17,190
for me it's all about visibility being

634
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:19,350
able to see it happening and be able to

635
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,640
track it so when they do add capacity

636
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,230
you know about it that's my biggest

637
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,870
challenge with cloud is if you've got

638
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,700
security tools and they add on like 15

639
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:28,110
you know fifteen hundred servers in one

640
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,610
day how do you track and know about it

641
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,020
and know it's valid and that they

642
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,929
authorized to do that and it was done

643
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,010
through the break provisioning process

644
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:37,890
because you will see situations where

645
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:39,570
new cloud instances will appear and you

646
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:41,250
don't know who owns them it's a bit like

647
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:42,929
files yes you know and we've had

648
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,510
responsibility for tracking down who

649
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:48,330
owns the file share and making sure that

650
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:49,620
sort of stuff yeah guess what now we're

651
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,659
going to be responsible for tracking

652
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,699
your own bloody server in the cloud okay

653
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,530
so we're going to have that and also for

654
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,960
me predictive capacity management this

655
00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:00,840
is an area where I think we could get

656
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,460
better at it we tend to just monitor the

657
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,110
moments when we don't our selves think

658
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,200
about predictive capacity and it's

659
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:08,790
seasonal and it's going to change so

660
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,250
those are the five parameters that I've

661
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:14,100
tried tried to translate from the

662
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,420
physical security world to our world of

663
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,899
security and the sort of thing that

664
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:20,250
we're dealing with right that's great so

665
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,960
you've got new ways of talking about it

666
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:24,150
you could say okay is this technology

667
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,630
going to make it more technician or well

668
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,480
robust

669
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:30,750
this does allow me to do graceful

670
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,850
extension and contraction okay how do

671
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:36,780
you do that so those are the five

672
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:40,409
factors I like this for my Alma like

673
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:42,420
Tisa right so measuring as I said

674
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:43,470
remember the beginning I said measuring

675
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,510
is the key thing

676
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:51,120
if you can't present it it's not worth

677
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:54,780
doing blonde hair so I'm a sci-fi person

678
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,489
I don't like murders thrillers I spend

679
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,590
my whole life dealing with that on a

680
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,970
daily basis and being asked what are you

681
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,260
worrying about I'd rather go into an

682
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,360
artificial world with the world

683
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:06,570
everybody the good people we learn about

684
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:10,590
people but this for me is what in the

685
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:12,240
end cyber resilience is all about we

686
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:16,070
know it's going to happen but we need to

687
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:19,100
be flexible in agile okay although I

688
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:21,330
have a statement and this is kind of

689
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,649
it's a it's a rule for talking to

690
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:25,560
executives the higher you get up an

691
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:27,780
organization the less you should

692
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:32,129
communicate to them and you're going

693
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:34,100
well now the executives they don't want

694
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:36,330
to know the details they trust you

695
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,929
believe in yourself they know you're the

696
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,970
experts

697
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:42,390
they might test you occasionally but

698
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:44,700
they want it short sharp and sweet so

699
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:47,310
you know it's like sometimes if you go

700
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,930
into a meeting especially if you're in

701
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:51,750
you're in an organization just listen

702
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:54,300
just absorb the information and then

703
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:56,190
that one statement we far more impactful

704
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,740
but I work with the Japanese

705
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,390
and we work with the Japanese so there's

706
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:03,150
a funny there's a wonderful hierarchy in

707
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:07,380
the Japanese and I was in this meeting

708
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:10,320
and I was sorting out firewalls etc and

709
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:14,430
I had FedEx to live me if I firewall

710
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,260
that was bent virtually and Anna did was

711
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:19,320
asked and is about there ready good

712
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,700
about it and I'm in the meeting and

713
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,260
there's this guy in the corner is the

714
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,510
head of table very quiet doesn't say

715
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:27,750
anything I present and debate and

716
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:32,370
everything and then this guy says says

717
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:36,720
Paul how do you thought about this

718
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:41,850
if I could I said well no but and I got

719
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:44,130
a kicked under the table um let me see

720
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:45,990
about it he was the boss

721
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,210
he didn't scenting but that one sentence

722
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,510
was what matters and everybody else

723
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:54,840
realized what he said was important so

724
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:56,850
getting back to the thing in security we

725
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:00,240
have a unique world where everything we

726
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:02,429
present has to be the truth we can't lie

727
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,290
about a ddos we can't lie about a piece

728
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:06,750
of malware we can't lie about data

729
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:08,820
breaches we have to become upfront and

730
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:13,440
be brave enough to sit there and say yes

731
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:15,210
I'm mucked up I mean getting there this

732
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,640
was success and sharing successes from

733
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:21,620
other things but I need to do it in a

734
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:29,880
way that the executive really gets it so

735
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:34,110
this is the tool will go who are you

736
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:35,820
gasps oh no no no for me it was really

737
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,800
fascinating because basically what it's

738
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,550
showing here to our house I have a laser

739
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,190
okay

740
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:43,320
this is basically time going along here

741
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:47,490
I'm putting simply this is the impact

742
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:50,879
level right and so we declare an instant

743
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:52,429
throughout here right and then we start

744
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,750
mitigating down here we start responding

745
00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:58,020
and the level of impact how much

746
00:29:54,750 --> 00:30:00,150
degradation is here and how long it took

747
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:02,639
us to do here and how long did it see

748
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:06,120
before we recovered it's a really nice

749
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:08,970
simple damn stupid graphic I can present

750
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:12,689
that to an executive and okay oh great

751
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:13,650
are we improving are we failing but

752
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,500
uh-huh

753
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:17,820
I'll show you so if it's sort of

754
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,260
mathematical so the first thing you

755
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,919
present it the first time they all go

756
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,990
ooh

757
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:25,650
glazed over and then off like you've

758
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:28,530
done it right and it DHS studies and

759
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:30,179
such so you can use that now okay so

760
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:31,320
this is a give me a test with that then

761
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:35,309
give you a the bloody answer down the

762
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:38,129
bottom so this is a good example where

763
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:41,850
actually what happens we saw the

764
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:44,460
incident we had not much impact short

765
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:45,510
amount of like down sort of real impact

766
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,940
on and fast recover

767
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:49,530
and guess what we actually improve the

768
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,960
capabilities of the organization our

769
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:56,870
security team

770
00:30:50,960 --> 00:31:02,460
that's the who yeah okay this one hmm

771
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:06,418
okay we detected we degraded very very

772
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:09,559
quickly short amount of time but you

773
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:13,470
know we recovered which one looks better

774
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:15,360
visually okay people say I'll go the

775
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:17,520
deeper it is the more red I seem and the

776
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:21,090
deeper and the winery's this one's like

777
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,980
okay not as much time having an extended

778
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:26,059
amount of outage time it's been a

779
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:32,720
business impact time all right

780
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:34,889
and this one's like ye horrible this is

781
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,650
very fast degradation

782
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:41,220
so you think catch it in time bang down

783
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:42,960
it goes sure the amount of time for you

784
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,669
to start putting in places you're

785
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,570
covering but you haven't recovered yet

786
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:50,730
you're not back to full operation so you

787
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:52,770
can present these and now also have them

788
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:55,350
instead of you having to do numbers and

789
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:56,610
things like that you have numbers in a

790
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:59,909
graph that can actually show you how

791
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:01,049
you've improved lot improved etc and

792
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:02,070
start justifying thing it's a very

793
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:04,350
clever technique

794
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:05,460
I thought open I don't I think by thing

795
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,139
this is great because for an executive

796
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,090
once you get this you can have this in

797
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,250
little corner of an instant reports

798
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:13,320
maker who picture yes okay I understand

799
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:15,150
what it is ooh yes you did how does it

800
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,460
compare okay here's how we did before in

801
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,750
this situation or in general great way

802
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,700
of working so I like that

803
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:30,200
don't infants you like it but I've

804
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:33,289
always good so Bing Bing back okay

805
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:40,759
so how am i doing for time

806
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:42,590
okay so for me if you think about those

807
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:44,840
five terms which you're going her

808
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:50,418
cushion ability resistance robustness

809
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:52,189
etc how do I map my tools to that and

810
00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:54,139
I'm thinking about trying to map say

811
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:58,090
like a firewall how does that affect

812
00:32:54,139 --> 00:33:02,469
your cushion ability well it doesn't

813
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:06,499
there's an IDs help you with your

814
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:09,409
capacity your ability to expand maybe

815
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:11,629
not the key thing for me is it's

816
00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:12,820
actually how you handle and manage those

817
00:33:11,629 --> 00:33:14,869
systems that matter

818
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,480
it's the processes and the procedures

819
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:19,580
that make the difference so when you're

820
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,799
starting to present your strategies to

821
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,869
your businesses and this is a different

822
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:25,759
way of thinking and I've used it myself

823
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:27,590
and it worked well I've always had a

824
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:30,529
reputation for increasing my security

825
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:33,738
budget I can share those techniques and

826
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:35,570
some point but you don't just present

827
00:33:33,739 --> 00:33:38,179
the technology but you talk about how

828
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:40,340
it's going to impact your cyber

829
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:42,169
resilience and how the processes and

830
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,629
procedures and the technologies combined

831
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:47,359
together to create a more resilient

832
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:50,059
environment because now they understand

833
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,850
I mean every CEO ever CEOs claiming

834
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:54,139
credit for

835
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:55,428
if you don't know you've been you know

836
00:33:54,139 --> 00:33:57,229
you either hacked well you don't know

837
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:59,299
you've been hacked yet sort of thing you

838
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:00,799
know they all know that now the

839
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:02,929
executives understand so you can

840
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,440
actually use this so do they pick the

841
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:07,850
boxes it's just a different way I'm if I

842
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,049
get a chance I'll actually put something

843
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:11,299
up and send it the countermeasure team

844
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:12,949
so how I'm mapping the processes each

845
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:15,649
one of the technologies and how I think

846
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:18,138
you could improve a process or where you

847
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:19,578
respond to improve those five aspects so

848
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,069
when you present it to an executive is

849
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:25,579
okay here's my justification for how we

850
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:31,879
do things right because you want to get

851
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:34,549
to this yeah you understand that now the

852
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:37,040
first time I presented it I got the well

853
00:34:34,549 --> 00:34:39,799
that now you know that's a good position

854
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,270
your exact is no good decision I mean to

855
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:43,730
be honest you're not going to get that

856
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:48,829
every single time okay

857
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:50,119
if you are you're a genius okay even

858
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:51,770
though to be honest when you're going

859
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:54,710
into security operations you do want to

860
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:56,480
target that and make sure it's not just

861
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:59,630
your metrics but it's the business

862
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,160
metrics make sure you're representing

863
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,869
the other parts of the organization in

864
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,509
that number take credit for somebody

865
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:07,160
else's ability to be able to do things

866
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,869
better faster more effectively more

867
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:13,460
securely aiming more in compliance

868
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:19,130
that's important aspect so that was it

869
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:19,130
