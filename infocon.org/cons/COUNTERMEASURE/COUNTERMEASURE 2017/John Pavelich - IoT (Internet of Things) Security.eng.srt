[Music]

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,189
well thank everybody okay I got two mics

4
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:27,310
running um it's a real tall guy in the

5
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,430
audience to talk yeah would you sit up

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,869
here when they throw tomatoes at the end

7
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:34,720
I need something to hide behind I need

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,010
somebody who's really good with a

9
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,250
screwdriver hello it's really good with

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,710
the screwdriver

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,180
come on up hurry up

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,829
hustle up rule number one have

13
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:53,649
audience-participation right so what I

14
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:56,739
want you to do is you can down like sit

15
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:59,590
down there take this apart okay

16
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,660
don't lose the screws take it apart and

17
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,730
when you finish taking it apart you can

18
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,869
pass it around there's something really

19
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:08,310
cool inside two people just got a seat

20
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,940
so Internet of Things security let's

21
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:18,580
start a network of interconnected

22
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,939
objects so the key takeaway key takeaway

23
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:23,740
is you've got interconnected objects

24
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,780
with some embedded radio transmitter and

25
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,330
they send and receive data so you've got

26
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,610
an uplink and a downlink in the internet

27
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,650
of things and that could be pretty bad

28
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,280
and the number of devices when I wrote

29
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,400
this slide two weeks ago it was at 50

30
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,990
billion and I just read this morning the

31
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,509
latest estimate is 60 billion so there

32
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,700
are billions of devices in the Internet

33
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,979
of Things coming along and that's pretty

34
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:49,229
incredible

35
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,400
and for these threats or for these

36
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,780
devices they all operate in the broader

37
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,600
radio frequency spectrum and we're gonna

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,549
talk about that spectrum today and what

39
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:06,009
its impact is on you and some of the

40
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:07,509
things you'll hear about that spectrum

41
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:09,310
and I'll lay it all out on the line so

42
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,650
you get the ground truth for me but

43
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,120
basically you start to see a whole bunch

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,519
of protocols with these embedded devices

45
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:18,459
and these protocols are all kind of

46
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:20,700
interesting and as you start to study

47
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,410
IOT security you'll get very familiar

48
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,540
with these protocols and what they do so

49
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,190
when you come away with a download today

50
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,230
you'll have some basic information of

51
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,269
what those protocols are are and where

52
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:32,500
they lurk in the spectrum and how to

53
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,180
find them

54
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,379
but there's the internet of things at a

55
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:37,420
glance it's actually an ecosystem it's

56
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,120
from the watches we wear on our wrists

57
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,830
and I've got this really cool Garmin

58
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,110
Phoenix 3 and it sends me email messages

59
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,519
back and forth and tells me when my

60
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,170
phone's ringing and connects to the web

61
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,540
through my smart phone to a whole bunch

62
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,319
of things in our infrastructure and its

63
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:56,200
infrastructure heavy it's also Network

64
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,280
heavy on the backend well there's a

65
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,010
couple of problems in this um the first

66
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,099
one is most of the IOT devices are

67
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:09,280
connected via radio frequency and the

68
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,530
exact specifics aren't known but the

69
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,459
bottom end is 70% going to 80% probably

70
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:17,980
about 90% by the time those sixty

71
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,810
billion devices roll out somewhere

72
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,269
around the year 2020 so that's a pretty

73
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:26,049
significant thing and because they're

74
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:30,099
not on the wired network that means you

75
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:33,129
don't see the protocols so if you go to

76
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,900
your firewall and say look for ZigBee or

77
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,109
look for WiMAX your firewall doesn't

78
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:40,630
know what that means so that's starting

79
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,579
to create some issues for us as security

80
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:49,030
people many of these things these IOT

81
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,430
protocols are single-use so you can

82
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,079
control the lights you can control the

83
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,650
air-conditioning you control the HVAC it

84
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,419
starts to become part of your

85
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,579
infrastructure and in some cases it's

86
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:02,620
within your critical infrastructure of

87
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,230
your facility and now when you have

88
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,209
these billions of tiny little devices

89
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:15,430
like a watch like a pressure gauge how

90
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,108
do you patch them even when a security

91
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:19,450
vulnerability becomes known as a

92
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,700
manufacturer send like a water guy out a

93
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,430
water meter guy out to go patcher sensor

94
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,830
or does he connect to it remotely to

95
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,289
Patras enter sensor or just how does he

96
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:31,750
manage this and how do you know that

97
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,520
this is going on that somebody is

98
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,800
actually on your infrastructure doing

99
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,960
security patches if they can do them

100
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,419
chances are that they don't do them they

101
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:42,099
just let the devices sit out there and

102
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:42,639
be

103
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,580
vulnerable for a long period of time now

104
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,699
by now all of us we all security experts

105
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:49,659
raise your hand if you think you're a

106
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:53,310
security expert my hands down what

107
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,500
that's you know vague diagram I pulled

108
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,419
out of the web we start down around port

109
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:01,719
20 up to part 47 808 most of us

110
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,550
understand what those protocols and

111
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,050
ports are and we know how to secure them

112
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,849
right we've all got that pig and wired

113
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:12,520
security most of us have that page or at

114
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,740
least we have a methodology for dealing

115
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,439
with it and we're spending billions of

116
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,819
dollars a year

117
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:23,229
I guess defending that wired network and

118
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:24,849
we get to the Internet of Things and all

119
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:26,710
the wireless stuff leaving the facility

120
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,139
we've got gigabytes of data going back

121
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:32,699
and going forth uplink and downlink and

122
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,620
nobody's watching if you don't look you

123
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,590
can't detect even if somebody tells you

124
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,539
there's a vulnerability if you don't

125
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:42,400
know what ZigBee is you don't know where

126
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,560
it is in your organization you're likely

127
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,990
stuck so what are the threats let's just

128
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,339
briefly talk about the threats and then

129
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:52,659
I'm going to introduce you to a real

130
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:56,199
threat expert in the minute just do a

131
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,599
search on something like bugs on Amazon

132
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:01,029
or Ebay thousands and thousands and

133
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:06,190
thousands of devices rogue cell towers

134
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,699
in 2014 a rogue cell tower was known as

135
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,349
a stingray it was the domain of law

136
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:13,050
enforcement and intelligence services

137
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,460
they cost hundreds of thousands of

138
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,779
dollars and the idea was to do a

139
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:18,310
man-in-the-middle attack against cell

140
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,779
phones so you could pick off an

141
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,000
individual person's cell phone and you

142
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,139
could do nasty things to them and today

143
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:29,529
they're down in price so you want a

144
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:32,830
rogue cell tower $5,000 want to package

145
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,159
it in something that's interesting like

146
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:42,370
that hold it up you're smart enough you

147
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,960
can get things like rogue cell towers

148
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:51,940
inside power bars really cool now before

149
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,680
I get on and on talking about the threat

150
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,419
I'm not I mean I understand a little bit

151
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:57,009
of a technical threat I think you should

152
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:59,020
hear it from a real threat expert to add

153
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,000
some context into today's discussion

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,159
because context is always been that the

155
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:04,209
threat guys like we were running around

156
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:05,529
saying there's a threat there's a threat

157
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:07,300
you need a context so I'm going to

158
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,800
introduce you to Nicolas you're Koval

159
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,199
one of the finest cyber threat guys I

160
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,130
knew in the chief of Defense

161
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,779
Intelligence where he ran the cyber

162
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:16,990
threat cell for CDI for a number of

163
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:26,469
years Nick blown up good morning thanks

164
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:27,879
for the opportunity John what I'm gonna

165
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,800
do very briefly is just talk about as

166
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,959
John said some give us some threat

167
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:35,020
context around these these wireless

168
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,550
devices so I'm I have an Intel

169
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,349
background so you'll hear me speak from

170
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:39,759
an attacker perspective it's not like

171
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,319
I'm going to attack all these systems

172
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,330
but that is that is the perspective I'm

173
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,940
gonna provide context for so there's

174
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,740
basically three affairs or areas that

175
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,300
I'm going to talk about when is this

176
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,750
likely to be used how it will be used to

177
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,089
what usefulness to an attacker and what

178
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:56,379
are some of the risk areas from the

179
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:58,990
attacker so what you what the the main

180
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,159
challenge in trying to project the

181
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:01,360
threat of something that is not yet

182
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,149
widely exploited is that we don't have

183
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:05,919
that data to be able to make that

184
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,899
assessment with any confidence so in

185
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:10,360
order to project the directed threat

186
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,969
against something that is not yet seen

187
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:14,589
we have to do is go back to basics and

188
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:17,169
understand why attackers choose to

189
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:19,360
attack things so what you see on the

190
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,550
right hand side hopefully somewhat

191
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,419
clearly is a model I developed to to do

192
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:27,399
this to look at the motivations of an

193
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,870
attacker and try to determine in

194
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,959
particular cases for an attacker

195
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:35,620
specifically when they would affect a

196
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,990
specific type of of attack so the

197
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,179
primary factors that influence this are

198
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:45,519
the opportunity to conduct an attack the

199
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,100
ability to repeat that attack the

200
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,560
duration of effect or outcome the scale

201
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,680
of the target so the attack surface that

202
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,970
development I'm the ability to

203
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,470
synchronize their activity against their

204
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,200
outcome and the overall complexity and

205
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,520
when you look at these factors as a

206
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,050
whole what you want to look at is

207
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,270
whether or not an activity is worth the

208
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,430
return on investment of what the

209
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,290
attacker have to do in order to get the

210
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,149
outcome that they that they wish so you

211
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,290
can find an article explaining more

212
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,480
about this and Vanguard cyber or issue

213
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,070
back in April you can google that it's

214
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,470
online it's free so when you look at

215
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,520
this modeling your apply to this

216
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,899
situation basically what we come up with

217
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:22,420
are two very simple statements that are

218
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,550
that adversaries will only use wireless

219
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,399
threats when there was a specific return

220
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,130
on investment compared to another

221
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,470
another option or method the converse is

222
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,510
also true that scenarios were the ROI

223
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,089
for using this type of exploitation is

224
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:39,100
lower than other methods those other

225
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:46,480
methods are more likely so what are some

226
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,640
areas that we're exploiting this type of

227
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,830
technology could be useful for an

228
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,500
attacker well in cases where there are

229
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,270
no monitoring for this type of attacks

230
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,279
of wireless exploitation it will be

231
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,560
useful for sustaining access to a

232
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,770
particular target for re-establishing

233
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,300
access to that target right and that's

234
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,330
again gonna be based on how that that

235
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,480
target is is put together for it also as

236
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,860
John mentioned it's going to be has the

237
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,230
capability of circumventing a lot of

238
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,440
your classic choke point type security

239
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,570
you know your perimeter and your TRO

240
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,580
point on the network this is useful to

241
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,800
establish command and control and also

242
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,770
to propagate between devices in a way

243
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,779
that does not trip establish network

244
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:30,670
based sensors degree of repeatability

245
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,709
can also be very useful though is going

246
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:33,970
to be dependent on the target

247
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,320
environment that's also going to be

248
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,240
dependent on whether or not that target

249
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,770
is again monitoring for this type of

250
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,650
attack the last piece is useful is the

251
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,510
ability to invisibly pivot from one

252
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,670
device to another through wireless

253
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,560
interfaces and I'm gonna repeat this a

254
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,560
third time if the target environment is

255
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,860
not being monitored so risk here is why

256
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,300
understanding risk area is important

257
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,040
from a threat context it's important

258
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,750
because we want to there's two main

259
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,770
things first one engineering if we

260
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,089
engineer to reduce

261
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:08,470
we raised the risk for the attacker

262
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,689
we're reducing likelihood of those types

263
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:13,569
of attacks conversely if the risk areas

264
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:15,519
get eliminated you are increasing the

265
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,889
likelihood for those attacks to occur so

266
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:20,709
some of those risk areas physical access

267
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:22,149
a lot of these attacks many require

268
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,850
access or proximity to your target

269
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,029
although as John I believe is going to

270
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:29,980
talk about the potential from pivoting

271
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,149
from one device to another something

272
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,029
that we have to look we have to be

273
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:36,579
watchful of and is beneficial for an

274
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:38,709
attacker there could be some front

275
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:40,509
investment in new technologies and

276
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:43,360
tactics that could pose a risk there

277
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,569
could be time related risks to execute

278
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:49,930
related to this attack inconsistencies

279
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,730
in the target environment will reduce

280
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,279
the overall return on investment but

281
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,170
that is per target and the overall the

282
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,870
repeatability is something that the the

283
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,100
adversary is going to always want to be

284
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,449
worrying about they don't wanna put a

285
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:02,860
lot of money into an attack they'd only

286
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,319
use once so final thoughts is that as

287
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:09,670
exploitation tactics in this area

288
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,920
although they're nascent now as they

289
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:18,089
increase what we should see are a

290
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:20,170
reduction of the overall risk for an

291
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,399
attacker and again that means an

292
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:23,079
increase in likelihood of seeing these

293
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:26,620
types of things and the useful scenarios

294
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,389
for exploiting wireless IT devices and

295
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:34,240
protocols should increase over time

296
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,790
again increasing the likelihood that we

297
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,009
see these types of things at a minimum

298
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,269
what we should be doing as a community

299
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:41,980
is really establishing a baseline of

300
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,559
what we can see around us and monitoring

301
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,999
for those types of threats so that we

302
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,189
can again in the future make make a more

303
00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:50,110
informed decision as these types of

304
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,660
exploits start becoming more prevalent

305
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:57,719
thank you Thank You Nick Thanks

306
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,300
so it's always good to have contacts

307
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,500
when we're talking about new threat

308
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,670
areas because you know the sky is

309
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,380
falling with sixty billion devices but

310
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,060
what is the context and so that kind of

311
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,040
sets a good context now some of that was

312
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,010
very technical and spoke in big words

313
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,450
when I was very very young I worked at

314
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,970
one of the agencies and I was trying to

315
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,470
understand these things and they told me

316
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,690
well John it goes like this

317
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,959
one day a very senior politician said

318
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,540
I've got to get into this embassy

319
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,649
there's some information I want out of

320
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:26,940
it how do we get it and they went to the

321
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,860
agency there was super hi-tech looking

322
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,670
externally and they said yeah a couple

323
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,170
hundred million dollars a new building

324
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,200
fifty people a year of R&D will get you

325
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,000
everything that's ever spoken or said

326
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,290
and they said well that's kind of

327
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,700
expensive and kind of long we kind of

328
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,589
want it now and they went to that sort

329
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,240
of the National Police for us they said

330
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,730
what are you thinking they said ah well

331
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,890
like the garage on fire when they all

332
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,120
run out we'll send a guy in the back

333
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,320
door and he'll break in we'll get you

334
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,750
what you need this and fire it kind of

335
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,700
risky we don't like that you know our

336
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,230
experience with barn burning wasn't very

337
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,260
good and then the third guy there who

338
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,339
was kind of like the internal security

339
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:05,130
agency said look at guys it's pegged the

340
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:11,760
maids on my payroll context lots of

341
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,100
examples of DEFCON so if you want to do

342
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,529
open source on RF attacks and what

343
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:18,390
people are doing we go to DEFCON and we

344
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,959
look at things and they do all kinds of

345
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,370
attacks and some of the attacks are

346
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,110
coming out in the open press and so you

347
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,760
may have heard of things like I was

348
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,370
Jackie sniffer a word of warning you're

349
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,079
balancing on some pretty significant

350
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,850
ground here when you start to say on

351
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,339
doing attacks or I'm researching attacks

352
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,190
or I'm in possession of devices that can

353
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,190
do attacks you fall under the Criminal

354
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,560
Code of Canada so when you're dealing

355
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,329
with people say oh I know all about the

356
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:49,860
threat I'll do that threat Alice for you

357
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,170
make sure that those people are properly

358
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,470
licensed by the Government of Canada to

359
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,130
conduct such activities very very

360
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,329
important you might find yourself in hot

361
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:02,550
trouble or hot water otherwise by the

362
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,990
way Nick and I have access to a licence

363
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,940
so RF hacks in the news let's go briefly

364
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,410
and you can research

365
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,240
later on Network world wired and gadget

366
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,660
PC world

367
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,569
Ars Technica ZDNet sans the register

368
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:23,940
Gizmodo you know and it goes on and on

369
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:33,509
and on blackhat of course and more this

370
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:36,149
is the key takeaway if you want to

371
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:38,040
remember anything about what the future

372
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,730
is going to look like down there 2011

373
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,769
maybe three hacks at Def Con

374
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:45,810
I said Def Con was the place where we go

375
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,310
to look for open source things that are

376
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,069
happening you get up to 2016 there's 20

377
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:51,800
attacks and that curve looks pretty cool

378
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,290
so that tells you that there is a trend

379
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,290
over the last five or six years that

380
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,850
radiofrequency based attacks are

381
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,649
actually happening and being perfected

382
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,170
so what are the technologies that are

383
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:11,000
being used well software-defined radio

384
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,540
so software-defined radio is build the

385
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,009
radio once and then control everything

386
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,550
by software and that's kind of cool ten

387
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:24,689
years ago a cheap one was twenty

388
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:29,310
thousand dollars an enterprise-class one

389
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,019
or an attacker class one was in the

390
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,779
order of a hundred thousand dollars well

391
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:39,149
that was a long time ago today $20 puts

392
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:41,910
a software-defined radio in the hands of

393
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:45,060
any kid and $1,000 gets you a pretty

394
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,939
precise tool so now the cost of the

395
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:50,250
attack tools has dropped but that's just

396
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:55,309
hardware I mean what about software ah

397
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,559
software the new radio other programs

398
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,529
some are up there the software is free

399
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:02,970
downloadable and the cool thing is the

400
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,789
software is designed to be used on the

401
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:07,740
software-defined radio so now you have a

402
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,619
$1,000 attack tool and free open source

403
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,689
software

404
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:14,789
caveat emptor be careful what you design

405
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:16,319
with that open source software go back

406
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,359
to 101 ok of the Criminal Code of Canada

407
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,539
but it shows you that the cost of the

408
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:25,309
attack is starting to drop

409
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:27,599
now the big secret the Internet of

410
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,120
Things isn't about things it's about the

411
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,590
radios its radios that are embedded

412
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,260
around us

413
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,460
for example that Samsung s7 look at that

414
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,980
nine radios on the s7 that's kind of

415
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,870
cool where do they operate and you'll

416
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,179
start to see a trend that these things

417
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:52,860
are operating at the bottom and about

418
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,679
700 megahertz 500 megahertz and the top

419
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,440
end at about 3.5 gigahertz and that's

420
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,900
where we're starting to see all of the

421
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,409
protocols so you don't have to say 20

422
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:08,850
gigahertz 28 gigahertz 18 no 50 Meg's to

423
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,590
6 gigs is where it's happening and where

424
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,440
it's always going to be we follow the

425
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,740
trends we follow the standards there's a

426
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,740
home automation hub some of our sort of

427
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,409
trend look at that down to the bottom

428
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:24,059
four hundred Meg's up at the top 2.4

429
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,970
gigs

430
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,350
the attackers guide to the radio

431
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,570
spectrum if you have an attacker who's

432
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,330
going after the internet of things

433
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,039
that's where he's gonna be in that sweet

434
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,440
spot he's not interested in that other

435
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,419
stuff for a lot of good reasons first of

436
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,309
all the no targets there those 60

437
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:45,770
billion devices they're gonna be here

438
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,400
and this is where the current internet

439
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,610
threat internet of thing threat focus is

440
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,110
we're gonna look at these technologies

441
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,870
at the top you see Wi-Fi high data

442
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,150
throughput very short-range at the

443
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,130
bottom you see things like cig Fox and

444
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,980
on-ramp very low range data but very

445
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,789
long and I can confirm the Wi-Fi has a

446
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:11,570
range of one kilometer

447
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,620
now 15 years ago I was doing this

448
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,169
testing yeah a kilometer was pretty good

449
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:21,390
you'd get a decent Wi-Fi signal and

450
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,330
you'd get it off of devices that weren't

451
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,980
supposed to be turned on but were and

452
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,390
allowed you to do some pretty

453
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,330
interesting tests and that's just Wi-Fi

454
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:34,140
and and if you're a really good PCMCIA

455
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,409
card who remembers PCMCIA cards well the

456
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:37,770
first

457
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,330
Wireless cards are in there based on

458
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,700
what the Harris chipset if you took that

459
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,010
little cover off you could solder in a

460
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,140
new antenna connection and it would go

461
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,610
to this thing here which is big antenna

462
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,470
with an even bigger amplifier on the

463
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,050
back and all of a sudden you had an

464
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:55,770
attack tool then there's an attack tool

465
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,680
on that thing that I haven't loaded up

466
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,680
in years it's called frame thrower and

467
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,350
frame Thor was a hoof anism for

468
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,340
flamethrower

469
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,260
but if you remember the days of Wi-Fi

470
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,330
dfn occation attacks you could just

471
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,220
throw out D authentication frames and

472
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,140
you could take Wi-Fi off and that

473
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,180
concept was this was a tool that was run

474
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,890
under Windows 3.1 and you could sit

475
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,280
there and say Oh target network let's

476
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,430
flame it we didn't release that tool

477
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,730
into the wild section 101 ok it was a

478
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,920
great tool to experiment with that never

479
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,110
released into the wild so there are some

480
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,950
responsible people out there right so

481
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,870
what's the first thing that an advanced

482
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,330
persistent threat does reconnaissance

483
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,430
reconnaissance reconnaissance here's a

484
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,420
guy he put a ZigBee collection device on

485
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,760
a drone and he went around an industrial

486
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,960
park and said what ZigBee is out there

487
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,100
this has already happened

488
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,920
so he's going after ZigBee why because

489
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,480
they'd be had some interesting things to

490
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,520
it it was an unsecured protocol he flew

491
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,290
a drone around and says look who has

492
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,000
ZigBee I've done my reconnaissance

493
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,620
now that I've done a reconnaissance I

494
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,540
know if there's ZigBee in the

495
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,060
organization i want to attack and that's

496
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,560
just Sydney there's a lot of other

497
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,510
protocols out there too so that's kind

498
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,720
of interesting and the real problem is

499
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,300
that today if we care to look in our

500
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,130
organization's we find that it's ready

501
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,140
for radio and when you look you say oh

502
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,000
my gosh there's a nun configured ZigBee

503
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,220
network over here there's a bluetooth

504
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,020
keyboard or a mouse running here with

505
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,790
vulnerability we start to see these

506
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,230
things when we start to look into

507
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:38,280
organizations so what we need though for

508
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,230
this new field is a methodology and just

509
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,550
like everybody else I think we should

510
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,170
look at something similar to detect

511
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,920
analyze and respond but for dealing with

512
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,110
radios and that's different we're not

513
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,520
dealing with routers switches hubs and

514
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,420
all that Network stuff

515
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,460
people understand it's radios so who are

516
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,750
the radio people that are really good

517
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,820
what I go out there and look for people

518
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,760
I said well this guy won the DARPA

519
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,560
spectrum challenge with software-defined

520
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,080
radio that's pretty good that's like at

521
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,820
the top end of kind of researchers that

522
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,460
are out there now so those are the

523
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,900
people that I have discussions with and

524
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,790
that's very interesting what they do um

525
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,130
but let's get back to detect analyze and

526
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,350
I throw in locate and respond because

527
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,150
locate is kind of like a subset of

528
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,970
analyze but deserves special special

529
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,760
mention and detect the trend these days

530
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,350
we use collaborative software-defined

531
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,180
radios we don't use these big heavy

532
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,920
black boxes and run a computer on them

533
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,720
we actually take the chips we build them

534
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,710
into a sensor you build a

535
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,720
special-purpose sensor with multiple

536
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,190
software-defined radios on a single

537
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,140
sensor platform because then you can do

538
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,850
an imagine imagine that the things like

539
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,650
it you can say one spectrum look over

540
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,000
here the other radio look over there the

541
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,010
third radio do this continually scan and

542
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,420
you start to get some intelligence in

543
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,090
the way you scan for information and

544
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:51,030
find unknown signals analysis is to use

545
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,590
device fingerprinting what's in the

546
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,000
device so what's in that cell phone

547
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,250
those seven radios and that Samsung can

548
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,140
you analyze all of those and yes if

549
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,790
you're good you can but when you start

550
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,590
to do analysis of protocols that means

551
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,400
you're doing some heavy lifting

552
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,290
mathematically it's not the sort of

553
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,030
thing that's done on a laptop in a

554
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,670
multi-user large institution you're

555
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,260
talking of a back-end that's run on the

556
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,090
cloud where you can get the processing

557
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,100
power you need to look at the hundreds

558
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,720
if not thousands of devices in an

559
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,180
organization with five six seven

560
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,480
whatever radio is on them and when you

561
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,670
do your analysis if you drop down into

562
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,070
the protocol level you can start to say

563
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,720
I can create something that's very

564
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,430
interesting for the security world I can

565
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,660
create something called a radio

566
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,360
frequency persona or an RF persona

567
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,390
meaning that cellphone that belongs to

568
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,360
whomever you can say this is somebody

569
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,190
somebody's cellphone I know who it is

570
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,460
and if I tie that in to something else

571
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,250
which I'll show you later the RF persona

572
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,080
becomes very interesting from a security

573
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,620
perspective we're associating devices

574
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,660
with people locate is localization if

575
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,310
you say there's a threat and the radio

576
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,630
frequency fight and my days from

577
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,650
electronic warfare I can remember

578
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,750
sitting there just before the jump off

579
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,600
into

580
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:12,190
ah Panama there's a threat and the first

581
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:16,840
thing the colonel says we're got a

582
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,400
localized you've got to give them some

583
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,830
geolocation contacts to say the threat

584
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,510
is here he'll say oh great I'm not

585
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,800
worried about there I'm worried about

586
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,660
over here thanks very much when you walk

587
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,190
into the senior people and say there's a

588
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,390
threat and you don't tell them who what

589
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:32,760
and where they get kind of excited and

590
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,370
we respond so response is making sure

591
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,100
you have some human readable information

592
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,150
that you can give to the people that

593
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,010
need to make decisions so the RF persona

594
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,720
is very interesting it's a convergence

595
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,120
of physical and cyber security you know

596
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,130
all the radios and if you tie it into

597
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,990
access control systems and access badges

598
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,000
you can say oh the radio belonging to

599
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,560
the person is in the facility because

600
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,240
you know there are various e satiric RF

601
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,620
attacks assail make somebody else's

602
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,480
radio look like something else

603
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,620
and if radio is present and the persona

604
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,900
is not the person is not well that

605
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,580
creates something interesting to bill

606
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:11,650
analyze so detect let's drill down and

607
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,510
detect I talked about frequency bounds

608
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,640
you're gonna talk to some people out

609
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,540
there or say twenty eight gigs

610
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,670
thirty-two whatever no no no no no in

611
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:21,460
this iot of sixty billion devices it's

612
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,150
coming we're there and there's the top

613
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:28,500
protocols by front-end where W is Wi-Fi

614
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,570
fifty megahertz to six gigahertz no

615
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,810
further don't get sucked into buying

616
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,210
very very expensive tools which will do

617
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,200
nothing because the thing about

618
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,540
software-defined radios six gigs is

619
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,520
cheap after that its new sets of

620
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,320
chipsets and converters and they become

621
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,790
very very expensive

622
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,140
now lots of vendors would love to sell

623
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,340
you at twenty eight gigahertz radio

624
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,350
let's go to sit there and do nothing and

625
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,580
report on nothing it's like going to

626
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,070
port one hundred thousand Wow what port

627
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,270
one hundred thousand on your firewall

628
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,490
with my new box you know we don't have a

629
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:03,820
port 100 thousand and the detection has

630
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,400
to be scalable right so if you're

631
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,080
putting sensors up there and detecting

632
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,090
it's got a scale from the single office

633
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,530
which many people are pretty good at

634
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,570
doing now two whole buildings to

635
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:14,890
multiple floors to things that are

636
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,560
spread geographically worldwide you know

637
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,429
if you take the example

638
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:19,990
a military you have a headquarters here

639
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,220
and you've got a deployed headquarters

640
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,899
somewhere in the world you want to be

641
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:25,629
able to scale that detectability with

642
00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:28,539
your sensors or of your sensors and

643
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:30,309
remember you're analyzing a

644
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:31,809
multi-protocol Internet of Things

645
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:34,059
environment there are billions of

646
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,070
devices and more and more protocols

647
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,009
coming that kind of analysis is not done

648
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:41,200
on a laptop or a workstation it's

649
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,549
something that requires some pretty

650
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:44,529
heavy lifting in the backend so the

651
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:46,299
enterprise class systems that are out

652
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:49,419
there right now are doing it on the

653
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:54,940
cloud and by analysis I mean this many

654
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,429
people will come in and there's a pretty

655
00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:01,299
signal that is GSM you've got GSM in the

656
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:02,039
environment

657
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:07,419
wait no analysis is this and we break

658
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:10,179
down the GSM into this information and

659
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:12,549
more because it's much more relevant to

660
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:14,499
us and we store and save all this

661
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:16,929
information over time because we can go

662
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:19,539
back into these recorded logs of what we

663
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:21,399
saw and if there's an event we have a

664
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:23,830
post event analysis where this is a blip

665
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,720
on a screen and it's gone and that's

666
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,549
really kind of meaningless so we start

667
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:29,470
to understand that analysis is not just

668
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,059
a software defined radio showing a

669
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:33,009
pretty cool spectrum it's a bunch of

670
00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:34,690
back-end lifting where people are taking

671
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,700
apart the protocols and looking at the

672
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,470
information that's contained in those

673
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:42,999
protocols and a subset of analyzes

674
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:44,110
locate remember I said you don't go to

675
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,059
that commanding the commanding officer

676
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:47,740
and say there's a threat and without

677
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,350
telling them where and then modern speak

678
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:54,039
we understand propagation inside a

679
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,019
building very very difficult subject but

680
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:57,639
some guys are doing excellent modeling

681
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:59,830
right now we have to look at error

682
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,539
analysis sources of errors and there we

683
00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:02,799
start to talk about balance in our

684
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,809
systems right no sense having a

685
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:06,909
software-defined radio that's precise

686
00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:08,710
with the timing chip down to one part in

687
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,990
a billion when the antenna is you know

688
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,419
plus or minus 6 DB over five off days of

689
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:14,830
frequency that's not matching so we have

690
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,330
to match and understand the sources of

691
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,309
error filtering smoothing

692
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:19,570
cross-validation which really means

693
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,919
check targets if you have multiple

694
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:22,570
sensors in the room they each talk to

695
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,039
one another say I'm here you're there

696
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:26,230
yet we agree our propagation analysis is

697
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,279
pretty good or maybe we changed the

698
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,019
model and make sure we agree so it

699
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:30,639
becomes automated processes and the end

700
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:31,779
of the day is a

701
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:35,229
location estimates and in our location

702
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:37,330
technologies you will hear all kinds of

703
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:42,609
things the ground truth after studying

704
00:28:42,609 --> 00:28:44,769
it since 1987 I can't believe it's been

705
00:28:44,769 --> 00:28:46,299
that long that I wrote my thesis paper

706
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:49,059
on geolocation techniques angle of

707
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:51,039
arrival and T do a or time difference of

708
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,049
arrival inside a facility useless forget

709
00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:54,609
it don't let anyone tell you it works it

710
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:58,359
does not power on arrival works well and

711
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:00,369
it was the current thought up into about

712
00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:02,109
a year ago power on arrival says

713
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:03,729
basically I get some very precise

714
00:29:03,729 --> 00:29:05,769
measuring instruments we say precise

715
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:06,849
measuring instruments in the

716
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:08,710
software-defined radio world that means

717
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,799
they're expensive expensive instruments

718
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:13,599
that can give you pretty good results

719
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:16,659
but expensive infrastructure supporting

720
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:18,969
them we're talking of cables and timing

721
00:29:18,969 --> 00:29:21,909
mechanisms that are precise to better

722
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:23,649
than 10 nanoseconds and power

723
00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:24,849
measurement that's accurate to within

724
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:26,830
fractions is the DB over complex and

725
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,450
very difficult thing to do but it is

726
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,669
done some guys do have products they're

727
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:33,820
very precise the cost and the complexity

728
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,950
does not scale to enterprise class

729
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:39,309
deployments so power on arrival on

730
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:41,139
arrival works well but doesn't

731
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:43,629
subduction prototype I've been testing

732
00:29:43,629 --> 00:29:46,299
it for two years I'm meeting him flying

733
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:49,479
a week from now to Paris we're going to

734
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:51,839
sit in Paris and chat about things

735
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:54,549
including this new tool on how this new

736
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:58,119
tool which goes up to 2.5 gigahertz can

737
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,859
be adapted for the Internet of Things

738
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:02,529
and this tool is a precise instrument

739
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:04,690
it's a good instrument and it will

740
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,169
enable you to locate with pretty good

741
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:09,999
certainty within a few inches any

742
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:11,679
emitter and we're trying to get it up to

743
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:12,999
six gigs and we think we have a

744
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:16,029
mechanism for doing it so that's the fun

745
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:20,979
part of what I get to do I lost my

746
00:30:20,979 --> 00:30:22,930
clicker there it is

747
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,920
don't detect analyze respond locate

748
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,510
here's localization and then when you

749
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,820
create this RF persona you can say oh

750
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,640
I've got two personas here and if you

751
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,260
collect enough data you could say well

752
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,000
where were they during the date range

753
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,160
well you could say a single day a

754
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,250
specific time they were here that's kind

755
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,350
of neat if you say I have a range or a

756
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,270
date where some problem occurred I can

757
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,400
go back in time and look at the events

758
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,850
and recreate who what where when what

759
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,590
frequency what protocol and if I've

760
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,300
stored all that protocol information I

761
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,830
can say this is the radio that was

762
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,360
probably used oh here's the threat

763
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,370
factor that's a theory that's starting

764
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:07,750
to work out in practice and I can do a

765
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,940
single persona and all of his associated

766
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:13,660
devices over time or I can simply look

767
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,150
at there and say my entire environment

768
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,730
what devices are there and this gives

769
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,740
something called the electronic order of

770
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,410
battle what are the electronic devices

771
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:27,420
and where are they in my facility and

772
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:31,240
what might be threats so you've got some

773
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,520
pretty good analysis tools with the

774
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,040
geolocation and the RF persona to start

775
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,900
to drill down and do security

776
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:42,520
assessments on your facility and it's

777
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,140
important that there's a response and so

778
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,220
if an immediate knowing threat pops up

779
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:52,090
that threat is set up to an operation

780
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,800
center somebody who can take charge so

781
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,050
we have socks now we have reports and

782
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,930
returns the things that are doing IOT

783
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,060
security should be sending reports back

784
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,760
to the sock in human readable format not

785
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,460
there's a problem at 2.4 gigahertz on

786
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,070
hop 15 yeah I get that

787
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:11,170
no there's a Bluetooth thing and it's

788
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,880
giving Internet access and it wasn't

789
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,650
here before and it's in the server room

790
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:17,290
oh that's kind of important and if you

791
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,780
have a basic tool like Marty Kaiser you

792
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,060
can run down there and say it's this

793
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,560
server here and pluck it out and find

794
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,850
out what happened maybe find the

795
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,140
bluetooth dongle that was plugged into

796
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,560
the port at the back so that's you know

797
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,960
where we think you should go well I'm a

798
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,050
smart guy been around a long time and

799
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,909
one of the things I've been asking

800
00:32:36,909 --> 00:32:39,429
myself for 15 years what does the other

801
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:44,529
guy do what are the well what does the

802
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,269
enemy do right what does he do how does

803
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:49,330
how does he do things because I mean if

804
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,859
he's not doing anything either he's dumb

805
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:51,849
and I don't think he's dumb

806
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:54,009
or maybe he's doing things he's doing

807
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:55,599
things maybe I want to take note of what

808
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,710
he's doing and why is he doing it

809
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:06,279
there is the GUI that I cut out of the

810
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:09,599
screen of the Russian export system and

811
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,279
the Russians when they see a protocol

812
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:16,330
they don't like they do jamming with a

813
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:20,169
Cassandra SJ 11a push a button and jam

814
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:26,489
now yeah they do jamming da Nevada G

815
00:33:26,489 --> 00:33:28,599
radio electronic iya

816
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:35,830
Baba was Vatsa comrades the struggle for

817
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,109
the airwaves is back

818
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:40,239
NATO radio electronic combat they

819
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:43,239
haven't lost a beat in 30 years it's

820
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:45,749
great to see

821
00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:48,489
please don't jam we can't do that

822
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:50,049
legally in Canada I think that's also

823
00:33:50,049 --> 00:33:52,629
under the Criminal Code - outlaw jam any

824
00:33:52,629 --> 00:33:54,940
system that you have should be sending

825
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:58,179
up reports and your response should be

826
00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:00,609
dealing with it in a logical way with a

827
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:04,090
tool not by brute force jamming we're

828
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:06,729
not flying fighter jets we are looking

829
00:34:06,729 --> 00:34:11,168
after networks so where do we think

830
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:14,349
these sorts of systems are useful right

831
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:17,319
now well there's lots of classified

832
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:19,480
facilities out there last time I heard

833
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,449
the number of secure compartmented

834
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:26,349
information facilities was growing at

835
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:27,909
almost an exponential rate and it was

836
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:30,309
hard to figure out where what they were

837
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:33,279
all doing and you know your sweep teams

838
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,049
come in once a year once every two years

839
00:34:35,049 --> 00:34:37,329
maybe once every three years maybe you

840
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:39,339
want to put an automated system in there

841
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:40,750
and move it around from facility to

842
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,480
facility to say what's in my facility

843
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,789
and where is it so you can say oh and

844
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:47,199
it's supposed to be no wireless facility

845
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,149
but guess what there's ZigBee in the

846
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:50,489
air-conditioning unit attached

847
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,050
to the wall or maybe we want to get rid

848
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,210
of that kind of thing so this is where

849
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:57,750
we see the tools initially going for

850
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,730
high-value facilities where you want to

851
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,200
find the ZigBee the z-wave the home

852
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,670
security or the wireless systems the

853
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,290
security systems all that stuff and

854
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:07,020
maybe get rid of it or mitigate it if it

855
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,260
poses a threat the other place is in

856
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,660
digital force protection there's lots of

857
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,240
VIP conferences and we see fortune 500

858
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,010
is moving away to things like Montebello

859
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,170
and they'll buy out Montebello for three

860
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,640
days and have a conference there with

861
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,950
all their CEOs maybe we want a portable

862
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:25,080
system that can sit there and say hey

863
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,720
there are a few things out here that we

864
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,150
need to be aware of in these protocols

865
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:33,450
and we also want the handheld tools to

866
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:35,550
go with us a week as a practitioner can

867
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,950
say mm-hmm there is an emitter it's over

868
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:38,310
here

869
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,230
what am I going to do about it and

870
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:43,110
mitigate it or accept the risk like I

871
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,119
say we don't want to jam that's always a

872
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,000
bad thing in North America and similarly

873
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,710
if we have deployed operations in the

874
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,480
military it's where we see these sorts

875
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,980
of things because we get allies showing

876
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,109
up people coming in and out it's good to

877
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:57,150
know who's parked the emitter right

878
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,800
beside your headquarters and why I sir

879
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,470
and what it's doing so knowledge is

880
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,820
power when you have critical

881
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,970
infrastructure there are IOT things in

882
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,950
the critical infrastructure maybe we

883
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,480
want to start examining our critical

884
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,810
infrastructure because you know big

885
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:16,230
server rooms like this exist someone at

886
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,750
State Farm many years ago two rooms a

887
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,460
size four it is sitting with computers

888
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,619
where they ran their insurance and one

889
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:24,600
was production and one was death they

890
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,600
always been great they consume a lot of

891
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,970
power okay they had their own power

892
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,030
facility they consume a lot of HVAC what

893
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,970
if the HVAC was controlled by ZigBee or

894
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,640
some other protocol that wasn't secure

895
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,369
how would it be if that drone flew

896
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:42,810
around on the reconnaissance said I'm

897
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,040
just going to take down State Farm for

898
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,619
two days and hold them ransom August the

899
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:49,980
30th hotter than Hades air conditionings

900
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,619
on high drone goes by yeah you got

901
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:54,930
ZigBee controlling your HVAC shut down

902
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:57,810
the HVAC turn up the temperature I want

903
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:00,300
a million dollars in one day or your

904
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,740
servers are all going to melt

905
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,980
or if you're not operation the military

906
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,930
operation that's like I've just shut

907
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:10,530
down your server center because there's

908
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,690
no bar power going to it the heats been

909
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,430
turned on the people can't work I know

910
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,230
about you and me computers can sometimes

911
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,630
work to 30 or 50 degrees Celsius when

912
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,220
it's 50 degrees Celsius in the computer

913
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,750
room the computer guys running out the

914
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:26,099
door so we could detect things in our

915
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:27,869
critical infrastructure the most

916
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:29,910
important thing today is to ask

917
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:34,020
ourselves the question where is I o T

918
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,270
what IOT devices are running in our

919
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,940
organizations now that sixty billion

920
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,760
devices is coming there's stuff already

921
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,680
in the infrastructure we should be

922
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,200
asking ourselves a question what

923
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,440
protocol where what's it doing why is it

924
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,520
there and creating an awareness of this

925
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,250
potential security vulnerability that

926
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:00,630
might be there and that's my

927
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:03,050
presentation I hope you enjoyed it

928
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:03,880
[Music]

929
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,999
