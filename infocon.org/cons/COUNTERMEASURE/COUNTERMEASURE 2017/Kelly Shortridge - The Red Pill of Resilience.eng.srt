3
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,869
hi good afternoon so thank you for

4
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:27,000
having me I'm really excited to close

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,070
out the conference here today so I'm

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,660
gonna be talking about their red pill of

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,970
resilience this is not the reddit red

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,970
pill this is the matrix red pill so

9
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,540
don't get any wrong ideas and resilience

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,400
as a topic extremely important to me so

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,590
I hope I can convince you that it's

12
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,920
important too so first I'm Kelly Shore

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,450
I am a product manager at security

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,420
scorecard I used to do Investment

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,130
Banking I started the security startup

16
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,140
but what I really like to do kind of on

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,120
my nights and weekends is research the

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,820
intersections of behavioral economics

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,860
with InfoSec as well as look at

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,259
applications across different domains to

21
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:08,430
information security so I think there's

22
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,680
a big problem in InfoSec right now and

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,119
it's existed for a long time probably

24
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,979
like a lot of you guys have been in the

25
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,200
industry maybe for 10 years you've seen

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,180
this happen there's an obsession with

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,910
stopping or the more creative flirting

28
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,590
that I don't think is particularly

29
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,649
healthy so I think as well there's been

30
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:27,330
an insufficient exploration of what it

31
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,970
means to be resilient and I think most

32
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,740
poetically stated this is by Robert

33
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,929
Jordan referencing one of Aesop's fables

34
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:36,209
the oak bought the wind and was broken

35
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:38,429
the bill the willow bent when it must

36
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:40,649
and survived so I think to speak of

37
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:42,149
stopping or thwarting anything without

38
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:44,130
thinking about resilience doesn't make

39
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,640
any sense so prevention and deterrence

40
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,410
can serve as really valuable tactics I

41
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,390
think we all can agree on that but it's

42
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,520
not the only thing it can grant some

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,470
level of peace but it doesn't guarantee

44
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,330
that you'll continue to survive the war

45
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,429
so to speak generally needs a

46
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:01,979
Generalissimo Chiang kai-shek of China

47
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,720
poetically put it as the more you sweat

48
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,119
in peace the less you bleed and more the

49
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,380
idea is you can attempt the peace

50
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,270
through prevention we need to be able to

51
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,050
survive the war through resilience the

52
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,819
discourse in InfoSec I think has mostly

53
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,410
kept resilience at a buzzword level

54
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,540
particularly thinking about cyber

55
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,670
insurance if they talk a lot about

56
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,290
resilience I don't think we've had a

57
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,180
proper exploration of what that actually

58
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,340
means and really thinking about what

59
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,270
it's meant in other

60
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,730
contacts today so I think resilience has

61
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,740
this kind of torrential conceptual power

62
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,670
and I'm hoping to explore it here today

63
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,990
so resilience is ultimately about

64
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,330
accepting reality this is the nature of

65
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,120
kind of the war we're in and it's also

66
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,560
making sure to build your defensive

67
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,610
strategy around that reality first I'm

68
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,860
gonna talk about why it's time to talk

69
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,690
about resilience and why I think it's

70
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,220
time to have a paradigm shift and I

71
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,020
really don't use that term lightly and

72
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,500
also how our collective grief led us to

73
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,760
this point so I really think that we've

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,770
been going through a state or the stages

75
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,680
of grief in our industry next I'll share

76
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,020
the etymology of resilience InfoSec is

77
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,580
one of the newest applications there

78
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,840
have been a ton of others in different

79
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,060
domains including those with complex

80
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,820
systems so I'm gonna explore those then

81
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,670
finally I'm going to really hone in on

82
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,050
the three key characteristics of

83
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,670
resilience which are robustness

84
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,640
adaptability and transform ability so

85
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,900
really thinking about how you can

86
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,140
withstand attacks how you can reduce any

87
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,300
sort of losses incurred then finally

88
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,410
like how you can challenge your

89
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,670
assumptions going forward the stages of

90
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,510
grief I'm assuming most of you all are

91
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,860
familiar with them but I'm going to

92
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,450
recap and then show you how they apply

93
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,890
to InfoSec so I think the reason why

94
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,750
we've seen we're talking about

95
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,250
resilience is we're entering the final

96
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,720
stage of grief which is acceptance

97
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,940
basically the kind of thing that we're

98
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,980
grieving is the fact that there will

99
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,570
never be such a thing as an unhackable

100
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,990
organization or system so over the past

101
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,000
20 years I think we've been reaving this

102
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,560
fact that companies will never be able

103
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,510
to stop all attacks they'll never be

104
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,900
involuntary little can be done against

105
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,030
the latest exploit latest attack vector

106
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,970
and most the time we have plenty of

107
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,459
unknown methods and unknown actors with

108
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,200
whom like against whom we have to

109
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,630
wrestle like most grief it is in a

110
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,250
linear process I think we've had fits

111
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,290
and starts but I'm hoping that we can

112
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,820
finally get to kind of this final

113
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,430
acceptance stage so versus denial which

114
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,340
is clinging to a false sense of reality

115
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,800
I think it manifested as back in the 90s

116
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,419
companies thinking Security's not that

117
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:37,830
important to me we really aren't at risk

118
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,330
and not actually deploying any solutions

119
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,490
next is anger so recognizing the denial

120
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,379
can't continue and becoming frustrated

121
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:46,610
that it can't

122
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,349
I think this manifested in some of the

123
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:50,539
harsh penalties and legislations that we

124
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:52,629
saw kind of late 90s early 2000s

125
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:54,770
prosecuting and punishing vulnerability

126
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,569
researchers even those that are giving

127
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:57,949
away their research freely or we're

128
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:00,590
disclosing responsibly so basically it's

129
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,710
your fault that I need security the

130
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,449
third stage is bargaining so it's hope

131
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:07,099
that you can actually avoid the cause of

132
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:07,849
your grief

133
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,220
I think this resulted in the explosion

134
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,720
that we currently have of all the new

135
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,699
tools tons of fragmented solutions

136
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:15,919
because maybe we can stop attacks from

137
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,860
happening at all the fourth stage is

138
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,930
depression call and actually mentioned

139
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,669
security nihilism and I think this is

140
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:24,919
part of it so it's despair at the

141
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,289
recognition of your predicament so I

142
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:28,759
think it was kind of the refrain of like

143
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,650
everyone's gonna get hacked why does it

144
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,300
really matter it doesn't matter what we

145
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,039
do like as long as we're meeting

146
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:35,500
compliance who cares

147
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,940
but the final stage is acceptance and

148
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,340
that's embracing inevitability the new

149
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,740
reality so it's understanding that there

150
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,819
is a neva tech but it's also recognition

151
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:48,770
that you have the ability to prepare and

152
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,659
not all is hopeless so attacks will

153
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:54,830
happen but I can be prepared I do fear

154
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,690
that the bargaining stage has set us up

155
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,520
for failure in transitioning to the

156
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,529
acceptance phase again as I mentioned

157
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:02,150
there's been an explosion of security

158
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,490
tools which causes a huge problem and

159
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,409
results in what I think is an untenable

160
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:08,630
market for lemons there have been some

161
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,460
there's a paper called like no such

162
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,840
thing as a silver bullet insecurity

163
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,759
that's a really good paper on kind of

164
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,310
this problem bud also preys on this

165
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,349
desperation to bargain it's no different

166
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:20,000
than like selling the hope of a cure to

167
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,319
those who are chronically ill through

168
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,529
snake oil the bargaining stage in my

169
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:27,529
opinion is the basically the demand for

170
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:29,479
which snake oil is the supply and it

171
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:32,270
sets us up for failure but security

172
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,069
nihilism also isn't the answer again

173
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:35,930
that's part of the depression phase I

174
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,729
think it's an inaccurate conclusion

175
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:39,979
there are things you can do and one of

176
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:41,240
those things is make sure that you're a

177
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,909
resilient organization because when you

178
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,199
think that everything is hopeless it

179
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,729
doesn't incentivize anyone in this

180
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:49,430
industry to pursue smart strategies

181
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,529
right so I think it's really important

182
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:53,089
we have a conversation about what

183
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:55,250
resilience means and there are tactics

184
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:55,530
you

185
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,120
do that will actually make a meaningful

186
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,720
difference the etymology of resilience

187
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,670
and I know we are not in a college

188
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,620
lecture so I will keep this brief

189
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,960
basicly up until the early 19th century

190
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,210
the primary meaning of resilience was to

191
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,060
rebound it really started out in

192
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,430
engineering and that was in 1858 so it's

193
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,980
really to imply strength and ductility

194
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,540
basically the ability for a material to

195
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,670
go back to its original shape when it

196
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,940
was under some level of stress what

197
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,010
we've seen is that a definition in kind

198
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,470
of InfoSec and other realms has been an

199
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,820
abstraction from this physical

200
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,680
characteristic so bouncing back to

201
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,650
whatever the normal is defined like a

202
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,100
pre-existing stable equilibrium but in

203
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,810
the 20th century we saw in particularly

204
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,330
starting in the 1950s and awaking in

205
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,850
psychology where it's actually basically

206
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,040
one's ability to adapt to hostile

207
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,290
situations and stress over time because

208
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,970
naturally if you're exposed to some sort

209
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,280
of traumatic event you can't just bounce

210
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,900
back psychologically to the original

211
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,100
state you're not going to be prepared

212
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,600
we're kind of like you know think about

213
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,000
PTSD you have to have different coping

214
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,720
strategies in the 1970s it started being

215
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,600
used in ecology and the social sciences

216
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,860
eventually going into like climate

217
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,180
change basically all the areas where

218
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,130
humans are also affected by things that

219
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,290
happen scientifically and you can't just

220
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,330
think about it as we're rebounding to

221
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,650
the same equilibrium so it's really

222
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,880
thinking about how do you have

223
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,190
adaptability in that then finally in the

224
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,290
2010s with climate change disaster

225
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,330
recovery this idea of evolutionary

226
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,340
resilience is really important which is

227
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,169
that systems co-evolved together and

228
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:31,610
I'll talk about that in a second so

229
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:37,760
complex systems what is a complex system

230
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,599
that's basically when a lot of

231
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,250
underlying components interact with each

232
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,799
other it's very difficult to predict

233
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,110
behavior because everything is nonlinear

234
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,750
and examples in our daily lives like our

235
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,540
universe our planet's climate our cities

236
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,460
our brains our cells all of these are

237
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,770
complex systems I also happen to think

238
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,500
InfoSec is a complex system it's plagued

239
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,300
by an inability to predict attacker

240
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,250
actions and frankly oftentimes defender

241
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,410
actions too has highly interconnected

242
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,990
dynamic relationships their attackers

243
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,660
and defenders but then there are other

244
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,850
in the ecosystem like government's

245
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,650
software vendors software providers and

246
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,170
so forth so I think to attempt to unfurl

247
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,430
all these relationships is really

248
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,500
prohibitive and you can't do that in a

249
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,280
complex system so the first application

250
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,480
of resilience through the lens of these

251
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,820
complex systems was by CS Halling who

252
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,440
was one of the founders of ecological

253
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,620
economics and this was in 1973 the

254
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,390
basically the amount of change that

255
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,040
could be absorbed for the underlying

256
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,980
structure of the system changed so

257
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,140
ecological systems can be highly

258
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,420
resilient but also exhibit a high level

259
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,730
of fluctuation each time so a good

260
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,620
example of this is chestnut trees

261
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,930
actually so we were not in North America

262
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,940
forests were once full of chestnut trees

263
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,470
but there was a chestnut blight in the

264
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,030
first half of the 20th century that

265
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,310
completely wiped them out but the forest

266
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,900
didn't disappear was that oak and

267
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,600
hickory trees propped up like sprung up

268
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,580
in their stead it's basically continued

269
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,230
to adapt even though it had the same

270
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,070
underlying structure evolutionary

271
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,350
resilience is kind of beyond the CS

272
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,050
Halling interpretation in 1973 again it

273
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,610
assumes that there are socio ecological

274
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,640
systems that are co-evolutionary the

275
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,500
idea is it's not just about adapting

276
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,990
it's also about transforming so it

277
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,790
completely rejects the idea that you

278
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,020
should bounce back to whatever you

279
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,030
thought your normal was it's that there

280
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,650
is no real normal and you have to be

281
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,540
able to never like go between these

282
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,090
sorts of equilibriums you should also

283
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,190
have multiple level controls and also

284
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,780
the ability to kind of like reorganize

285
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,420
around whatever your reality is and also

286
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,220
being able to understand and question

287
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,230
the assumptions about what your reality

288
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,350
is as an example communities can

289
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,360
diversify their agricultural landscapes

290
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,160
and production systems in response to

291
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,780
climate change or other sorts of changes

292
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,720
so you can designate some moya's for

293
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,330
like so soil conservation multi cropping

294
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,670
organic agriculture you can protect some

295
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,490
forested areas as like preservation but

296
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,740
then use other parts for whatever the

297
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,310
needs of the town are this leads us to

298
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,960
what are the core characteristics as I

299
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,070
mentioned before its robustness

300
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,590
adaptability and transform ability you

301
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,210
have to be able to withstand a shock

302
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,730
adjust so as to incur less damage and

303
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,590
then also be opening to challenging

304
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,500
previous decisions and goals so in

305
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,720
InfoSec it means robustness you have to

306
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,060
be able to withstand an attack

307
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,470
adaptability is being able to adjust

308
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,180
your environment so you in current less

309
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,770
damage when attacked then

310
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,050
transformability is challenging your

311
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,940
existing assumptions around who will

312
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,630
attack you

313
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,700
what sort of attack it will be what the

314
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,810
right strategy is unfortunately in most

315
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,760
domains robustness was the dominant

316
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,000
defensive strategy can be linked back to

317
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,440
that idea of engineering resilience

318
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,730
which is really persisted for a long

319
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,820
time so in flood prevention for example

320
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,710
barriers are a form of robustness they

321
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,570
block storm surges that happen during

322
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,670
like hurricanes and other sorts of

323
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,670
storms hurricane Harvey though if y'all

324
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,190
are familiar it happened in Texas the

325
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,780
primary source of damage was actually a

326
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,060
flooding from rain not from the storm

327
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,100
surge so you have to have adaptability

328
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,260
and transform ability to incur less

329
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,060
damage from it and then also rethink

330
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,920
your existing strategy and what your

331
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,830
assumptions were so I know this is a

332
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,750
super trait that it's not about the

333
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,040
destination it's about the journey

334
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,900
that's like an Instagram caption but

335
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,030
it's actually really true here so it has

336
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,740
to resilience has to be framed as a

337
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,110
continuous evolving process but it also

338
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,810
has to be sustainable so Peter timonin

339
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,730
Timmerman who's also an ecological

340
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,880
economics caller described it as

341
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,320
resilience as the building of buffering

342
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,480
capacity into a system to approve its

343
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,070
ability to cope going forward the idea

344
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,930
here is if you focus just on robustness

345
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,240
I leads to a presentation of the problem

346
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,370
based on reducing the risk itself so

347
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,310
basically it's how can we withstand the

348
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,930
hurricane versus we know the hurricane

349
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,420
will hit us how do we make sure that the

350
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,160
damage doesn't completely wipe out our

351
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,160
community so addapt ability and

352
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,020
transformability accept that the risk

353
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,630
will exist while robustness doesn't so

354
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,160
it stresses the need to reduce the

355
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,110
potential damage and then restructure

356
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,210
around the risk and around your reality

357
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,180
I think a very appropriate quote is by

358
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,620
Susan Elizabeth Howe she's a

359
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,640
seismologist at the USGS and she looks

360
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,340
into like earthquake prediction and she

361
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,810
said a building doesn't care if an

362
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,940
earthquake or shaking was predicted or

363
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,070
not it will withstand the shaking or it

364
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:34,880
won't

365
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,230
so I think there's been a lot of focus

366
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,880
in security around how do we predict

367
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,709
breaches and not to say that's not an

368
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:41,360
important problem it's good to

369
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,430
understand the likelihood of it but if

370
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,139
you haven't designed your systems to

371
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:46,550
make sure that you can withstand a

372
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,769
breach you're not going to make it even

373
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:52,339
if you can predict it so even though our

374
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:54,470
industry I think we've borrowed from the

375
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,000
military that there are lots of unknown

376
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,310
unknowns or strategy it's kind of still

377
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,079
based in hubris that we can save

378
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,120
ourselves in the event of a breach with

379
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,529
systems that can kind of withstand

380
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:05,750
unknown risks at unknown times with

381
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,540
unknown faces but an evolutionary

382
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,490
resilience approach accepts that all of

383
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,480
these things will happen

384
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,310
that there are unknowns and accepts that

385
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,440
change is inevitable

386
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,550
so in insurance the system actually

387
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,069
survives by changing itself by making

388
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:21,970
you kind of have your own unknown face

389
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,470
that the first characteristic is

390
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:30,620
robustness so robustness involves

391
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,240
withstanding and resisting a negative

392
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,699
event as I mentioned engineering used to

393
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:36,380
this concept of robustness to mean

394
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,630
resilience it's basically how long it

395
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,550
takes to get back to whatever your prior

396
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,490
equilibrium was but if you think about

397
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,220
it if whatever system it was experienced

398
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,589
some sort of negative shock some sort of

399
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:51,139
damage due to an event the equilibrium

400
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:52,819
probably wasn't very good going forward

401
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:54,350
cuz it meant it was vulnerable to that

402
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,660
event so you wouldn't actually want to

403
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,870
go back to that equilibrium because then

404
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,800
then you're just setting yourself up for

405
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,100
failure again it's actually leads into

406
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,290
the safe development paradox so

407
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,220
basically when it's believed that a

408
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,199
technical word control will somehow

409
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,050
eliminate the risk or prevent some sort

410
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,970
of shock at least a larger potential

411
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,130
damage so it's a paradox because the

412
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,509
stability that's promoted by

413
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:19,579
implementing some sort of control to

414
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:21,769
reduce the risk actually results in you

415
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:23,889
building out more so think about in the

416
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,970
case of like cities which I'll get into

417
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,339
in a bit like if you have a levee it can

418
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:30,220
result in you building out the city more

419
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,540
so because there's a false sense of

420
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:32,990
security

421
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,819
you're basically over time increasing

422
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:37,279
that risk so ultimately you're creating

423
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,319
a maladaptive feedback loop so once the

424
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:41,300
structural mitigation is in place more

425
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,160
development happens but then as the

426
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,199
development becomes entrenched you need

427
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,760
more controls to make sure that the risk

428
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,960
doesn't actually cause

429
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,140
any damage going forward as an example

430
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:55,070
you know there's more so in the 80s fire

431
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,320
started to being suppressed and for us

432
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,730
that were fire adapted originally

433
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,870
because they didn't want forest fires

434
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,300
and fuels started to build up in the

435
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,700
form of trees or shrubs people wanted

436
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,110
you know to have human settlements

437
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,310
nearby they started building out

438
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,530
obviously people like pretty lungs with

439
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,870
trees shrubs everything else so what

440
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,700
happened for example in the 1990s in

441
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,040
Florida is that these fires really had

442
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,050
these forests had tons of tons of fuel

443
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,790
for the fire they were used to being

444
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,650
fire adapted having regular fires to

445
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,200
kind of call everything and then people

446
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,940
were completely devastated because the

447
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,360
fire was way worse than it used to be I

448
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,250
think similarly insecurity implementing

449
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,200
technical controls creates that false

450
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,640
sense of security that leads to

451
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,980
increased damage as well so retro

452
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,350
actively hardening or patching legacy

453
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,300
systems and which phones are frequently

454
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,160
found think about like with the Equifax

455
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,960
breach actually leads you to keep

456
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,760
building on top of these systems further

457
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,440
entrenching them which creates the need

458
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,090
for more technical controls and leads to

459
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,090
that maladaptive feedback loop so

460
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,320
basically feeling like the front threat

461
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,270
is being prevented leaves you to have

462
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,770
that false sense of security which is

463
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,740
not healthy as I mentioned in flood risk

464
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,150
management is actually called the levee

465
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,400
paradox so building a levee can lead to

466
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,990
a sense of the problem being prevented

467
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,849
supporting further development and

468
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:09,730
construction on the risky floodplain and

469
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,750
what's interesting is less than three

470
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,069
percent of people in Illinois for

471
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:15,349
example in areas with levees actually

472
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,940
have flood insurance so again it's a

473
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,380
false sense of security so they're kind

474
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,119
of completely screwed if the levee

475
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,740
doesn't work and a flood actually

476
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,140
happens so it lowers people's awareness

477
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,359
of the risk and the ability to respond

478
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,330
appropriately to it so when implementing

479
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,550
a robustness control it's absolutely

480
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,530
essential to ensure it's not encouraging

481
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,090
further development that could be

482
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,400
harmful and basically accumulating risk

483
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,770
over time that becomes cataclysmic so

484
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,870
don't just focus on resistance in your

485
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,940
controls really if you're doing that

486
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,440
you're treating the symptoms of bad

487
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,000
planning with structures and that won't

488
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,750
actually fix anything I also think

489
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,980
there's a lesson here for cyber

490
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,600
insurance if you think back to the flood

491
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,130
insurance example where people are

492
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,040
totally unprepared insurance companies

493
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,560
don't actually categorize those flood

494
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,490
plains that have loved

495
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,980
necessarily as floodplains themselves so

496
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,570
means that homes or offices in those

497
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,640
areas that become flooded don't have

498
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,380
like related insurance requirements

499
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,400
which means they don't have the proper

500
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,800
building codes and so forth so firms

501
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,300
offering cyber insurance so it should

502
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,280
consider really carefully what they're

503
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,290
saying will exempt companies from having

504
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,880
some sort of insurance or additional

505
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,000
insurance related to the safe

506
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,890
development paradox is the idea that

507
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,540
preventing a system from negative

508
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,790
exposure over time trying to silo it off

509
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,890
means that the system will only function

510
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,020
be able to function in that artificially

511
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,090
stable safe basically it'll only be able

512
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,400
to function if it's siloed off so in the

513
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,140
levy paradox it creates an artificial a

514
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,820
stable system which can only survive

515
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,820
when there are dry conditions

516
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,990
another example kind of from the

517
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,090
wilderness again is with coral reefs so

518
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,220
marine reserves are created to protect

519
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,809
coral and make sure that they aren't

520
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:53,090
exposed to the effects of climate change

521
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,550
like ocean acidification and thermally

522
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,540
induced coral bleaching

523
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,820
but unprotected Curl actually proves

524
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,020
much more resilient to climate

525
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,910
disturbance because they face ongoing

526
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,950
degradation due to other factors and

527
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,929
they actually start to mix with more

528
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:08,420
disturbance tolerant species so what we

529
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,800
think we're trying to protect we're

530
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,679
actually setting up for failure so an

531
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:15,080
infra sec you have to likewise expose

532
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,360
your systems to external stressors so

533
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,440
even if you're building something that

534
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,360
you think will only ever be internally

535
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,690
facing like like internal only api's you

536
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,920
should design them with a threat model

537
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,990
in mind that is still externally facing

538
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,490
so like making sure you have data

539
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,230
standardization even if it's in turtle

540
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,179
only so obviously always test your

541
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:34,040
systems as if they were externally

542
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,330
facing and making sure that they're

543
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,770
resilient to kind of these global

544
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,980
threats the overwhelming focus to date

545
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,570
on info suck as I mentioned I think has

546
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,480
been on how to stop Fort block attacks

547
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,890
really how to prevent them from

548
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,300
happening in the first place and

549
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,670
bouncing back to normal so traditional

550
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,960
components of security if you think

551
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,800
about firewalls

552
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,230
antivirus system hardening are all

553
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,740
components of this robustness strategy

554
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,260
and the other problem is that even with

555
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,240
remediation the goal is to return back

556
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,250
to normal but as we saw with Equifax

557
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,870
like when you have immutable data

558
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,550
there's no such thing as returning to

559
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,550
business as usual it just won't happen

560
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,860
so pen tests tend to focus just on

561
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,960
vulnerabilities and what's needed to fix

562
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,909
rather than proposing new technologies

563
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:19,220
or new architectures that would make

564
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,690
sure that your system isn't vulnerable

565
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:24,860
in the next instance other domains held

566
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,450
this sort of strategy as well and it

567
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,669
worked out really poorly for them so

568
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:30,530
engineering led approaches tended to

569
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,780
defy try to define nature rather than

570
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,330
trying to work around nature so the

571
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,740
single equilibrium and flood risk

572
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,659
management is to have dry conditions and

573
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:40,460
flood plains so that people can continue

574
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,590
living in them dikes storm surge

575
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,929
barriers dams were all attempts to

576
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:46,549
withstand a flood and keep them from

577
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,620
happening and they reflect engineering

578
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,900
resilience approaches but the goal is to

579
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,640
keep the same artificial equilibrium in

580
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,080
spite of the water systems natural

581
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,610
behavior that hasn't worked out very

582
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,510
well so I think the engineering only

583
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,799
focus has led to the current situation

584
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,380
where companies basically survival rests

585
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,929
on them keeping up to date with patches

586
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:08,690
which is really hard to do the model

587
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,700
that has to be embraced is one in which

588
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,669
even if a system is like not patched it

589
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:15,380
can still survive that all your data

590
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,929
isn't out in the open so even if users

591
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:21,409
click on PDF zip exe your systems are ok

592
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:24,289
as we saw with with coral if there isn't

593
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:25,730
some sort of palpable risk and you

594
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,520
weren't testing against that risk

595
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,870
resilience is very unlikely to actually

596
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,730
be developed do you have to assume that

597
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,200
attackers will gain access to your

598
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,220
system and then develop around that but

599
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,270
I don't want to say that robustness

600
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,070
isn't important because it is one of the

601
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,289
key characteristics of resilience so you

602
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:44,750
have to have you know layered approaches

603
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,070
so drawing again from flood risk

604
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,080
management there have to be layer of

605
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,549
controls and diversity of solutions

606
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:51,710
against storm surge barriers dikes

607
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,780
dams early warning systems and so forth

608
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,929
you have to have multiple controls a

609
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:58,610
good example is on New York City where I

610
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,440
live has published guidelines for

611
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,110
climate change resiliency and recommend

612
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,510
a combination of controls so for example

613
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,980
the excess heat that's likely to come

614
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,929
about from climate change they recommend

615
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:11,030
having backup generators to hybrid power

616
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,250
systems using systems with higher heat

617
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:13,820
tolerance

618
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,950
passive cooling and ventilation with

619
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:16,820
window shades or high-performance

620
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,789
glazing like not just one thing like set

621
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:21,409
it and forget it you have to do multiple

622
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:25,070
things diversity of controls also helps

623
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,309
provide redundancy and

624
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:29,769
certain conditions so when complementing

625
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:31,240
measures are in place it's less likely

626
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,340
that there will be catastrophic damage

627
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,190
if a single control fails the trade-off

628
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,809
here is between efficiency and

629
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:40,419
effectiveness obviously so the easier

630
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:42,759
route is having lower upfront costs to

631
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:44,889
implement a singer' single control but

632
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:46,720
if you want effectiveness it will take

633
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,100
layered controls which will be

634
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,139
longer-term and potentially higher cost

635
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:53,139
that'll pay dividends over the course of

636
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:56,679
the system's life cycle I don't think

637
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:58,330
this is a new concept for many of you

638
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,999
like you can deploy the apt blinky box

639
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:03,549
on your network it purports to stop all

640
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,289
attacks I think we all know here it

641
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:08,230
doesn't so what happens if an attacker

642
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,450
has legitimate credentials to like a

643
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,279
cloud-based service it's not really

644
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:14,409
gonna help you in that case or as we saw

645
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:17,440
with Kaspersky the apt blinky box can

646
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,929
actually be used by the apt itself to

647
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:23,320
get into your network I think diversity

648
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,850
can also be seen through the lens of

649
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,769
systems so I'm not the first to suggest

650
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:29,110
this idea dan gear got fired for it back

651
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:32,289
in 2003 and at stake talking about the

652
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:34,749
hegemony of Microsoft as far as systems

653
00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:36,940
dominus so we think of fragmentation

654
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,259
normally as poor to have from a

655
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:40,509
management perspective but there is an

656
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:42,340
argument in its favor which basically

657
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,950
shared hosting provides correlated risk

658
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,049
and we can't forget that because the

659
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:48,639
financial crisis was caused by this as

660
00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:51,549
well everyone ignored correlated risk so

661
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:53,460
if there's a breach at one provider

662
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,809
vulnerability in a common shared library

663
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,629
it's gonna create like much greater risk

664
00:23:58,629 --> 00:24:00,100
exposure than there would be otherwise

665
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,320
so you have to consider whether

666
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,169
fragmentation is actually worth it so

667
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:07,809
there is a pitfall which is um of

668
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:09,879
efficiency which is that it creates a

669
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:12,700
limited kind of area of operation in

670
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,649
which your systems can survive basically

671
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:16,450
when you're only able to function within

672
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,970
kind of your nice beautiful garden it's

673
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,649
not gonna work otherwise but if you

674
00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:22,269
introduce fragmentation and you kind of

675
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:24,820
have messy diversity of systems you're

676
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,320
kind of hardening the system over time

677
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,879
because you can adapt better to a

678
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:29,499
certainty that arises out of the

679
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:32,830
pregnant ation but it is up to for

680
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,850
debate whether you want the

681
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,649
manageability or you want the minimized

682
00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:38,139
impact via diversity asset management is

683
00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:40,000
hard enough as it is if you have lots of

684
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,220
diversity and fragment

685
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,970
obviously that's gonna make it much

686
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,190
harder so that's I think something that

687
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,750
I would love to talk about on an

688
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,330
industry level but uh thinking in

689
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,890
decision trees can also make sure that

690
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,270
you have this proper diversity of

691
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,100
controls so I've discussed decision

692
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,840
trees and prior talks like a black hat

693
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,910
all my slides are always online so you

694
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,530
can check them out but the goal should

695
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,330
be to walk through the steps an attacker

696
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,830
would take in order to get to whatever

697
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,809
their goal is but importantly it's also

698
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:06,520
thinking about what mitigations they'll

699
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,410
come across like very simply if you've

700
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,090
to factor you have to think about okay

701
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,400
the attacker encounters two factor what

702
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,620
do they do next you can start to see how

703
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,360
you need to layer and complement your

704
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,260
controls in that vein so raising the

705
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,120
costs to the attacker serves to me as a

706
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,530
bridge between robustness and

707
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,390
adaptability there are a few quotes

708
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,340
which I reuse constantly and one is by

709
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,440
denote ISO V which as attackers will

710
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,210
take the least cost path through their

711
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,250
attack graph from their start node to

712
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,980
their goal node so if you can raise the

713
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,600
cost to the attacker you can start

714
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,580
deterring attackers and kind of that

715
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,650
notion of how can we prevent the attack

716
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,570
from happening at all but it does mean

717
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,950
attackers will need greater resources

718
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,450
and a grade of level of sophistication

719
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:49,990
to do so which is what you want one way

720
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,730
to raise costs is through diversified

721
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,830
controls but another way is through

722
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,550
adaptability

723
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,860
so adaptability is about reducing the

724
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,170
cost of damage incurred and keeping your

725
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,130
options open

726
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:11,010
to support eventual transformability the

727
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,630
evolutionary approach I mentioned where

728
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,700
systems are Co evolving is one which the

729
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,320
assumptions are that conditions will

730
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,140
change constantly and adapt over time so

731
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,880
the system itself has to incur this

732
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,950
long-term change and reversion to that

733
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,930
pre-existing state isn't actually

734
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:28,650
desirable the intergovernmental panel on

735
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,420
climate change actually highlights the

736
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,950
need for realism and warns about the

737
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,790
dangers of incremental change versus

738
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,110
adaptation and that a lot of people call

739
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,960
adaptation or what they call adaptation

740
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,420
is actually just incremental changes so

741
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,220
they specifically recommend questioning

742
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,720
underlying assumptions and existing

743
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,850
structures you have to acknowledge the

744
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,559
inevitability of this macro level change

745
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:52,590
and then you make manage transformation

746
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,920
the goal rather than anything else so it

747
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,390
creates a false sense of security if

748
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,710
you're just kind of undergoing these

749
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,150
incremental changes without really

750
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,559
questioning your assumptions about the

751
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,929
reality and it's part of the safe

752
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:06,059
development paradox in my view so you

753
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,350
can't alleviate symptoms in the

754
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,400
short-term but you're not really

755
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,679
preparing yourself for success long term

756
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,620
a good example that's on a macro level

757
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,510
related to climate changes actually with

758
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,610
animals so traditional production

759
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,380
strategies for wildlife at risk is to

760
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,910
like keep them if you think about the

761
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,250
pandas like siphon off some area where

762
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,080
they can enjoy bamboo whatever else so

763
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,510
it's preserving existing habitats the

764
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,520
problem is they're in static locations

765
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,960
and they become increasingly isolated

766
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,300
and actually creates genetic ghettos

767
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,700
that set up those animals for failure if

768
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,370
they ever have to leave those areas but

769
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,020
if you look at what wildlife naturally

770
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,480
doesn't have done and has done over time

771
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,700
in Prior climate change events they

772
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,500
actually track their ideal location so

773
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,630
they'll migrate like for example up the

774
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,250
mountain to whatever is preferable for

775
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,410
them so recommendations that you now see

776
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,640
for climate change in preserving

777
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,100
wildlife now include the idea that for

778
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,470
example if ideal conditions or let's say

779
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,170
you know across from a city you create

780
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,910
whatever their current situation is you

781
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,920
create like a very narrow land bridge or

782
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,210
they can pass through and get to that

783
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:09,510
ideal location I like to think of legacy

784
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,100
systems like these preserved habitats

785
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,080
we're preserving them through patching

786
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,740
and retroactively hardening

787
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,830
but again the adaptive model from nature

788
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,960
is that we need to actually migrate to

789
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,690
new territories and new systems so to me

790
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,760
it's similar in effect moving to a

791
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,830
different mode of operation or new

792
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,100
infrastructure as a tangible example an

793
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,809
organization status code might be that

794
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:34,240
they use inlaid PHP code within the HTML

795
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,070
of their web apps to perform database

796
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,559
queries so if injection bawlin is found

797
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,870
in one instance of the PHP code they'll

798
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,610
patch that they won't really do a review

799
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,679
of all of their systems so they're

800
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:46,210
improving robustness by patching that

801
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,309
code and they're returning to the stable

802
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,870
equilibrium but they're not really

803
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,820
solving the problem embracing

804
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,650
adaptability would say okay instead of

805
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,570
using inline PHP code let's create a

806
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:58,150
single class for database queries it

807
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,190
also helps if you have lots of developer

808
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,840
turnover they're not going to be totally

809
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,400
confused trying to hunt down all the

810
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,660
instances of inline PHP code

811
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,790
preservation can also lead to misleading

812
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,280
indicators of resilience so for example

813
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,590
with coral again there are static

814
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,150
measurements like high coral cover or

815
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,160
fish abundance they're actually poor

816
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,630
indicators because they're lagging

817
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,580
indicators so they're just measures

818
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,140
measurements of what used to be

819
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,850
favourable conditions and don't reflect

820
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,670
the current reality so what you want to

821
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,320
do is ensure that your threat models

822
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,670
aren't based on favorable past

823
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,160
conditions so organizations using a

824
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,800
library with no known Vollmer

825
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,690
or perform continuous reviews but they

826
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:43,630
should the issues that attack our

827
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,070
methods or vulnerabilities aren't always

828
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,690
well publicized a lot of times they're

829
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,910
kept private so you have to frequently

830
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,440
review their secure your security

831
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,330
posture assuming that there will be

832
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,100
bones found that eventually something

833
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,840
will come out this is a recent example

834
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,580
probably some of you had to update your

835
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,200
threat models and systems based on

836
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,300
eternal blue coming out it's not like

837
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,070
when it came out suddenly it was

838
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,320
starting to be used had been used years

839
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,179
and years before you just weren't aware

840
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:10,330
of it and the climate change realm

841
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,130
moving members of a species that are

842
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,470
used to warm areas to intermingle with

843
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,150
client it's kind that live in colder

844
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,490
areas actually helps improve the

845
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:21,370
adaptability of the herd I think

846
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,440
likewise apps built on legacy systems

847
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,970
and libraries which have never been

848
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,830
exposed to the outside world which

849
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,600
suddenly need exposure to external aid

850
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,880
TI's tend to fare extremely poorly in

851
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,260
security terms you may have worked on

852
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,210
projects that kind of fell apart once

853
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,060
you expose them to the outside world so

854
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,200
similarly in the unprotected coral

855
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,450
example the lack of the system's

856
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,640
exposure to the threat has weakened its

857
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,560
ability to adapt and survive the threat

858
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,570
so you should intermingle your

859
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,130
internally facing systems with your

860
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,320
totally facing systems to ensure they

861
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,790
meet kind of these global standards

862
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,010
again your pen tests have to be kind of

863
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,360
assuming that at some point they will be

864
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,080
externally facing another example is the

865
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,460
goal for cities in the face of natural

866
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,530
disasters is to maintain a flexible

867
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,300
approach in order to properly adapt

868
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,490
their response to lots of different

869
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,980
kinds of risks that change over time so

870
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,540
cities have to cultivate and it's

871
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,640
recommended guidance and certainty in

872
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,860
surprise into their approach otherwise

873
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,420
they're being completely unrealistic

874
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,350
about the kind of ecosystem they're in

875
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,190
similarly I think you have to test

876
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,960
attacker playbooks against yourself to

877
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,550
determine how quickly you can actually

878
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,100
adapt to attacker methods so probably a

879
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,870
lot of you wish you had in-house red

880
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,970
team's some of you may if you do have

881
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,070
them have your red teams map out the

882
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,540
decision trees that they use when

883
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,340
they're conducting their assessment also

884
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,100
map out all the different ways that they

885
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,630
actually didn't succeed and just make

886
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,190
sure that you're doing that over time to

887
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,860
see like how you're adapting to as they

888
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,960
evolve their own methods over time for

889
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,340
those of you who don't have red teams

890
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,960
that's obviously unrealistic to hire

891
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,570
them often at least once a year is still

892
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,340
useful they're starting to be tools

893
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,570
coming out there to doing automatic

894
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,670
playbook testing which could be useful

895
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:01,030
going forward but on other ideas if

896
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,380
you're familiar with Netflix's chaos

897
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,270
monkey you have to be able to test your

898
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,070
ability to absorb the impact of an

899
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,720
attack and minimize the damage

900
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,210
so once such test is failure injection

901
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,150
so chaos monkey is part of Netflix's

902
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,040
suite of tools called the simian army so

903
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,960
it kills instances in order to test

904
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,150
their ability to survive some sort of

905
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,700
like widespread outage it's actually

906
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,500
described as a resiliency tool so it's

907
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,300
kind of perfect it was designed with a

908
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,590
performance use case in mind but I

909
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,270
actually think you can be used really

910
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,860
well for security because it makes

911
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,480
persistence really hard

912
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,250
you're constantly killing instances at

913
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,230
random attackers aren't gonna know like

914
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,180
one or where or like how long they're

915
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,800
gonna have of course very good attackers

916
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,880
are gonna be able to conduct their

917
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,279
operations learn very quickly but for a

918
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:44,080
of attackers it's probably going to be

919
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,159
prohibitive the idea with chaos monkey

920
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,659
for Netflix is to design a cloud

921
00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:51,820
architecture which even if a single

922
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,549
component fails kind of the whole system

923
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:56,529
survives so similarly you need to design

924
00:32:56,529 --> 00:32:58,539
a security architecture again where if

925
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:00,729
one component fails your system doesn't

926
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,169
have a complete meltdown

927
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:05,889
I understand rethinking security

928
00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:07,539
architecture is hard you don't have

929
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:09,219
enough people you don't necessarily have

930
00:33:09,219 --> 00:33:12,279
enough budget I do think a lot of times

931
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,869
people think about organizational

932
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:15,940
pressures is the main hindrance to being

933
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,950
able to adapt and InfoSec but I actually

934
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,200
think the complexity uncertainty from

935
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,119
that fragmentation of tools that I

936
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:24,309
mentioned is frankly the number one

937
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:25,779
source of being overwhelmed because it's

938
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:27,009
like where do you even start and

939
00:33:27,009 --> 00:33:29,229
architecting some sort of new security

940
00:33:29,229 --> 00:33:32,859
strategy but I think one way to do that

941
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:33,999
is actually switching to new

942
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:36,639
infrastructure so I don't know how many

943
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:40,210
of you use containers but the plain case

944
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,070
monkey is one example containers is

945
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:45,339
another it really helps with

946
00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:47,139
transformability which is what I'll be

947
00:33:47,139 --> 00:33:50,139
talking about next but I think they're a

948
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:51,909
natural fit kind of for evolutionary

949
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:53,679
resilience because they promote

950
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,029
adaptability and support

951
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:57,309
transformability I don't pretend to be a

952
00:33:57,309 --> 00:33:59,289
container expert you want to learn more

953
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,659
about containers at just as a sort

954
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:02,139
Witter

955
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:03,969
that's a link to a ton of talks that are

956
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:05,889
really helpful but I think she

957
00:34:05,889 --> 00:34:07,419
highlighted in her recent talk at DevOps

958
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:09,579
days that containers actually represent

959
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:12,219
an opportunity kind of like a salvation

960
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,510
from the trade-off you normally have

961
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:17,020
between security and usability as per

962
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,639
Microsoft containers are a way to wrap

963
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,649
up an application kind of its own pretty

964
00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:22,809
neat box they're an isolated resource

965
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:25,510
control and a portable runtime

966
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,129
environment so basically serves as a

967
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:29,260
layer of abstraction between the

968
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,270
application and its host server and it

969
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,679
can be like virtualized or bare metal

970
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,260
and so it allows for easier migration so

971
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,909
even if the underlying infrastructure

972
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,289
changes you can still have your

973
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:39,819
applications and you don't have to

974
00:34:39,819 --> 00:34:42,789
rebuild them every time so it really

975
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,559
bolsters flexibility and flattens

976
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,399
complex avail implicitly er to figure

977
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,109
out what's going wrong the legacy

978
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:52,210
approach makes figuring out root cause

979
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:54,639
really really difficult but you have

980
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,080
with containers bare

981
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,360
probably working systems you understand

982
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,460
kind of like all the dependencies makes

983
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,450
remediation a lot less messy also it

984
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:06,520
allows for better transportation to

985
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,830
infrastructure you can actually manage

986
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,720
again dependencies and licenses a lot

987
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,640
more easily then it's also easier to

988
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,290
kill the infection and stop the spread

989
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:16,420
so similar to chaos monkey you can just

990
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,890
kind of like wipe out a container and

991
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:21,400
rebuild it if it becomes infected you

992
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,290
have to ensure adaptability to manage

993
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,540
resilience erosion as well so in the

994
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,150
case of coral there are these posts type

995
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,820
stressors so you can think about those

996
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,830
as acute kind of short term stressors so

997
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,930
it's like tropical cyclones coral

998
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:37,360
bleaching destructive fishing but then

999
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,190
there are press type stressors which are

1000
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,720
long term so that's pollution

1001
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,570
sedimentation overfishing ocean warming

1002
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:46,270
acidification so it really causes um

1003
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,970
when the long term stressors occur a lot

1004
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,980
it causes the resilience the acute

1005
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,710
stressors to really go down so basically

1006
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,630
the more complexity you have in your own

1007
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,190
systems that's gonna be a press type

1008
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,140
stressor that long term stressor it's

1009
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,460
gonna reduce your ability to withstand

1010
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,650
the short-term impacts like a data

1011
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:05,110
breach so as you add complexity to your

1012
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,420
apps and systems it comes more difficult

1013
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,580
to test every possible path attackers

1014
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,740
could get into and it begins trending

1015
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,630
frankly towards infinity which no one

1016
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,590
wants to have to deal with

1017
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:17,350
so you basically eroded your resilience

1018
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,480
if you can't test your vulnerability any

1019
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,760
longer so you won't have adaptability or

1020
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,750
transformability

1021
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,979
the final piece is transformability

1022
00:36:30,979 --> 00:36:33,440
so you want to challenge your existing

1023
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,049
assumptions and reorganize your system

1024
00:36:36,049 --> 00:36:37,759
around the nature of your reality so

1025
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:39,920
back to the prior example of the

1026
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,769
horrible inline PHP code it makes it

1027
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:44,299
really hard to reorganize your system

1028
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:45,890
around reality versus single class

1029
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,450
because it's very hard to migrate it

1030
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,849
over time as your company's environment

1031
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:51,440
changes you're basically gonna have to

1032
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,910
wrestle with that all the time your

1033
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:53,960
engineers are gonna be really mad

1034
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,219
because they have all this technical

1035
00:36:55,219 --> 00:36:58,210
debt no one's gonna be happy

1036
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,950
research from other domains has explored

1037
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,599
the policy implications of trades for

1038
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:04,640
mobility and also how to implement it on

1039
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,109
a practical level so in disaster

1040
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:08,479
recovery particularly urban areas has

1041
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:10,039
been really well researched in the Spain

1042
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:13,219
so again thinking about floods what

1043
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:14,450
makes more sense in the event of a

1044
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,069
hurricane or something else is actually

1045
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:17,900
moving systems out of the way

1046
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,420
ideally building in the urban area in a

1047
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,819
way that doesn't directly expose it to

1048
00:37:22,819 --> 00:37:24,549
the threat even if it's low probability

1049
00:37:24,549 --> 00:37:26,539
so the policy should be to change

1050
00:37:26,539 --> 00:37:28,160
location not keep adding those

1051
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,799
structural controls so as a tangible

1052
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:32,690
example of this if you've been to New

1053
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,489
Zealand Christchurch was really

1054
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:37,099
devastated by an earthquake in 2011 the

1055
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:38,930
cost to rebuild has been put at 40

1056
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:41,150
billion dollars which is huge it was the

1057
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,190
second most populous city at the time of

1058
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,509
the earthquake it's now the third most

1059
00:37:44,509 --> 00:37:45,969
populous it was that much of a hit

1060
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:49,460
killed 185 people and destroyed over a

1061
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,869
hundred thousand houses so it was a

1062
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:53,960
massive wipeout when New Zealand did is

1063
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,670
they didn't let people just rebuild in

1064
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,950
the same area for obvious reasons or

1065
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,630
what should be obvious from the talk but

1066
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,329
they designated a red zone where

1067
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:03,249
rebuilding was neither safe nor

1068
00:38:03,249 --> 00:38:05,930
economical so basically they conducted

1069
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,430
an assessment to figure that out

1070
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:10,069
they offered money to the citizens you

1071
00:38:10,069 --> 00:38:12,229
had houses there in order to relocate

1072
00:38:12,229 --> 00:38:13,999
so the assessment really embraces this

1073
00:38:13,999 --> 00:38:15,920
transformed ability it questions the

1074
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,599
assumptions about should houses actually

1075
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,420
be unlike a fault line and says that you

1076
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,269
should do something else instead you

1077
00:38:23,269 --> 00:38:24,710
should identify the red zones within

1078
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,809
your own IT systems so which

1079
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:30,769
technologies or sort of infrastructure

1080
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:33,079
strategies present the highest level of

1081
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,910
risk and are gonna be really hard to

1082
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,619
actually fix vulnerabilities and won't

1083
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:38,410
have that sort of level of resilience

1084
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,579
maintenance cost can also be thought of

1085
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:41,060
this like

1086
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,560
said complexity will reduce your

1087
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,960
resiliency over time so what are your

1088
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,790
red zones that are contributing to that

1089
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:49,970
complexity so systems

1090
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,410
I think systems that are directly

1091
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,660
exposed internally or entirely

1092
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,280
public-facing should be obvious ones

1093
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,240
where they need extra love and attention

1094
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,860
exposing critical functionality anything

1095
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,240
having personally identifiable

1096
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,520
information like UC systems with

1097
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,530
outdated libraries systems with no

1098
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,420
backups that aren't easily restored all

1099
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,130
of those you should really think about

1100
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,320
like do you want to move it to better

1101
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,270
infrastructure like how can you make

1102
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,040
sure to protect it and question your

1103
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,840
assumptions around why are you using

1104
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,580
those systems why are you operating them

1105
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:23,210
in that way so I don't think defining

1106
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:25,460
red zones really should be focused on

1107
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,990
vulnerabilities I think it needs to be

1108
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,700
thinking about the path to actually

1109
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,740
compromising systems so for an example

1110
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,470
an API consuming critical data should be

1111
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,520
in a red zone whether it has

1112
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,140
vulnerabilities or not because it's

1113
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,720
consuming critical data you have to

1114
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,700
assume again that'll be attacked and you

1115
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,440
have to build your assumptions around

1116
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,680
that model so you want to identify the

1117
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,480
assets that fall under your red zone

1118
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,430
criteria and migrate them to a safer

1119
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,520
system so locking down public exposures

1120
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,800
so then it's only accessible via your

1121
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,530
corporate VPN rebuilding the asset using

1122
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,750
newer infrastructure technologies like

1123
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,330
containers proxy encrypted data further

1124
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:04,400
into the architectures core security

1125
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,410
logging and monitoring walking down

1126
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:08,360
privileged access kind of the basics in

1127
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,370
that way so by implementing all or at

1128
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,590
least some of those solutions the system

1129
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:15,260
won't be in a red zone any longer so

1130
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,460
it's similar you can think about moving

1131
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,680
a power plant out of the floodplain and

1132
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,900
building it like on a cliff and adding

1133
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,710
like early warning systems so using

1134
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:27,560
again the example of levies researchers

1135
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,060
have proposed an idea that you actually

1136
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,890
have planned decommission of levies over

1137
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:33,140
time because it would be really unfair

1138
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,880
to ask people to move away overnight

1139
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,010
because this is a floodplain and we're

1140
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,330
doing this new strategy people would

1141
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,400
probably get up in arms so you have

1142
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,560
these planned decommissions the idea is

1143
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,540
that levies can be then a stopgap before

1144
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,940
you actually transform so I think the

1145
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,620
idea is that you want to continually

1146
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,630
consider how you can prepare in advance

1147
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,820
for migration so maybe you have planned

1148
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,020
decommission of like

1149
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,670
systems you make sure that as you're

1150
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,650
building out new applications there on

1151
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,450
new infrastructures that you're able to

1152
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,330
transition them over I think instead of

1153
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,830
just continually retro actively

1154
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,360
hardening and patching your systems

1155
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,480
again be starting to migrate have an end

1156
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,310
date for when you'll stop patching and

1157
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:12,320
everything so it also ensures that you

1158
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,790
aren't renewing software or hardware

1159
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,170
that you don't think actually bolsters

1160
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,240
your security posture and like you're

1161
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,740
always checking those assumptions about

1162
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:22,130
what's working and what's not I also

1163
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:23,450
think collaboration is really really

1164
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,770
important in this a lot of as you

1165
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,060
probably picked up what I've talked

1166
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,190
about requires have this cross

1167
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,190
organizational collaboration so rather

1168
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,960
than relying on like inferred knowledge

1169
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,880
towards a predefined goal you should be

1170
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,590
upfront about like here are the risks

1171
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,660
here's what we're accepting is for the

1172
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,310
risk here's where the risks aren't

1173
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:41,930
covering what we're doing which I know

1174
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,670
sometimes the security professionals

1175
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,440
makes us uncomfortable because we want

1176
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,300
to be able to say yeah we've got it

1177
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,130
we're doing a great job it's much more

1178
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,780
beneficial to the organization to be

1179
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,670
resilient to say listen we're doing a

1180
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,350
great job to cover these sorts of risks

1181
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:56,510
but listen the controls we have are

1182
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,720
still leaving us exposed to X Y Z

1183
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,620
otherwise it's really difficult for

1184
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,210
communities to figure out how they can

1185
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,830
help and what they need to do to prepare

1186
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:07,160
I think you should have open sharing

1187
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,900
that kind of the protections in place

1188
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,120
what risk remains and uncertainties in

1189
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,030
the approach as well to try to foster

1190
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,380
collaboration particularly engineers

1191
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,760
like I don't know about yellows

1192
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,140
experience but I think engineers a lot

1193
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,430
of times find security really

1194
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,470
fascinating so bring them in and start

1195
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,670
telling them about this and maybe

1196
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,560
they're using something like containers

1197
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,820
or something else where they think it

1198
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,110
could mitigate some of the risk

1199
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:30,020
I think containers are an interesting

1200
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,730
example because they benefit so much

1201
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:33,170
from something like containers and

1202
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,970
security can as well and improves

1203
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,070
adaptability for both groups so everyone

1204
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,410
really benefits I think the trend

1205
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:40,940
towards flexibility is maybe one of the

1206
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,980
strongest in engineering today and it

1207
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,870
also obviously supports what I'm talking

1208
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,820
about for security there's a book that

1209
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,530
came out recently by O'Reilly called

1210
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,660
agile application security if you want

1211
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,400
to read more about this idea of

1212
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,900
partnering with engineering on these

1213
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,720
sorts of projects really in this

1214
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,070
collaborative model your role is to

1215
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:00,350
manage what I call state transitions so

1216
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:03,440
you want to help people you know migrate

1217
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,300
away from the floodplain area where they

1218
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,610
don't have insurance to the safer area

1219
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,410
I don't think you can remove the need to

1220
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,570
like create or implement solutions to

1221
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:13,220
some extent you're still gonna have to

1222
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,080
do a lot of the work but also think

1223
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,720
about kind of offloading and outsourcing

1224
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,100
some of the work onto the rest of the

1225
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,620
organization again like with the

1226
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,640
engineering group they'll probably

1227
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,290
conduct the work to like migrate to

1228
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,730
containers you don't have to do that

1229
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:27,410
there requires you sitting down with

1230
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:30,140
them and thinking through it a good

1231
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,120
example is I'm John for Flint at

1232
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,650
Facebook gave a great talk a few years

1233
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,480
ago about implementing two-factor

1234
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,460
authentication at Facebook so the goal

1235
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,980
is to put 2fa on SSH to make it hard for

1236
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,600
attackers to pivot into Facebook's

1237
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,610
production environment as you can

1238
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:45,320
imagine like he had to think very

1239
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,440
carefully about UX because SSH like you

1240
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,180
don't really want to add any friction to

1241
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,460
that process so they decided to use

1242
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:56,720
Jewish security and a Yubikey nano so if

1243
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,950
you're not familiar with you because you

1244
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,450
just have to touch basically a dongle on

1245
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,220
the side of your laptop in order to

1246
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,680
authenticate the duo's cloud-based token

1247
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,330
ensured that there was backup access in

1248
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:07,190
case like an engineer loss there you

1249
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:10,130
Baqi the key discovery for them during

1250
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:11,450
this project was you can actually

1251
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:13,550
implement so this is a direct quote you

1252
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:15,110
can actually implement security controls

1253
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,700
that affect every single thing people

1254
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,500
are doing and still make them love it in

1255
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,990
the process it works so well that they

1256
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:22,790
decided to put it on to their email into

1257
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:25,130
their VPN too but it required them

1258
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,810
really reaching out and speaking across

1259
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:29,600
the organization even though I

1260
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,010
recognized like software is eating the

1261
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:32,930
world every company sort of becoming a

1262
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,760
tech company most companies now have

1263
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,010
like dev teams in-house or engineering

1264
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,990
teams in-house that's not true for

1265
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,760
everyone sometimes you have a limited IT

1266
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,620
group it doesn't mean you can't

1267
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,090
collaborate you probably have a General

1268
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:45,920
Council or some other risk person or

1269
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,800
even like sales frankly there are ways

1270
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,840
that you can leverage like how to make

1271
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,730
their jobs easier and how to make their

1272
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,590
jobs better it'll still promote

1273
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:58,670
flexibility for you for this sort of

1274
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,290
transform ability to happen you need

1275
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:02,030
really responsive governance systems

1276
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,580
obviously you have to implement decision

1277
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,900
making processes that are really

1278
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,210
responded to emerging threats you have

1279
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:09,710
to ensure that your organization is

1280
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,990
learning from prior experiences so you

1281
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:13,430
have to be able to update your models

1282
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:15,110
after a breach think again about those

1283
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:17,720
sort of decision tree processes your

1284
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,760
entire organizations community has to be

1285
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,470
prepared so again it goes

1286
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,510
to the transparency around sharing

1287
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,730
information you have to as an

1288
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:27,980
organization be open to continually

1289
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,510
challenging the assumptions around your

1290
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:31,550
strategy in security I think

1291
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:33,319
implementing a security culture and

1292
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:35,030
having fun with it in your organization

1293
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:36,829
is perhaps the best chance of doing so

1294
00:45:36,829 --> 00:45:39,650
like kelly la mora Lauria is she's known

1295
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:41,420
better talked to yesterday like they

1296
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,160
have an actual their security team has

1297
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,869
an actual candy budget at flatiron

1298
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:46,609
health to encourage people to come by

1299
00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:48,650
and just talk and also talk about like

1300
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,810
what are their challenges how to make it

1301
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:52,640
work better for them instead of like

1302
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,530
being adversarial it's really like

1303
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:55,970
reaching out and making sure that

1304
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:58,069
there's some way that you can make their

1305
00:45:58,069 --> 00:45:59,630
lives easier and then the intern they

1306
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:07,640
can make your life easier too so to wrap

1307
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,819
it up I think this is my very very

1308
00:46:10,819 --> 00:46:12,470
humble attempt at a definition

1309
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:15,319
I hope it's refined over time I think

1310
00:46:15,319 --> 00:46:17,329
resilience and security means a flexible

1311
00:46:17,329 --> 00:46:19,579
system that can absorb an attack and

1312
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:22,220
reorganize around the threat so the

1313
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,660
system in this case is likely your

1314
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,640
organization but I think it applies at a

1315
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,950
more micro level as well so it's not

1316
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:30,050
about the ability to just withstand or

1317
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:32,150
prevent an attack that's the blue pill

1318
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,880
the red pill is that attacks will happen

1319
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,890
to you that's just the reality but you

1320
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:38,960
have to architect your security with

1321
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,450
that assumption so I'd like to think

1322
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:43,310
that I've shown you kind of how far the

1323
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:45,619
rabbit hole goes with all of this and

1324
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:48,050
that robustness adaptability and

1325
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:49,790
transform ability and all three in

1326
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:51,800
concert or the only way to kind of like

1327
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,980
survive robustness again is optimized

1328
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,170
through diversity of controls of the

1329
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:59,930
healthy fragmentation adaptability

1330
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:02,089
minimizes the impact of an attack and

1331
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:04,849
also keeps your options open for example

1332
00:47:04,849 --> 00:47:06,410
through new types of infrastructure such

1333
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,839
as containers then transform ability

1334
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:10,430
demands that you challenge your

1335
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,470
assumptions and reorganize around the

1336
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:14,540
reality so it's a reality that affects

1337
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,069
communities and that requires a

1338
00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:19,310
collaborative effort so in Malcolm if

1339
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,810
you're familiar with Jurassic Park he

1340
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:22,339
was my favorite character growing up

1341
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,450
sorry

1342
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:26,240
I think it's actually a very built very

1343
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,470
applicable quote for how you should

1344
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,810
think about strategy so the history of

1345
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:31,940
evolution is that life escapes all

1346
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:35,000
barriers life breaks free life expands

1347
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,950
New Territories painfully perhaps even

1348
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:39,530
dangerously but life finds a way so I

1349
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:41,000
think a lot of times we think of

1350
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,740
security is in this kind of like silo

1351
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,390
and very neat box where you can only

1352
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:46,880
perform certain functions but I think

1353
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,290
you should think about how can you break

1354
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:49,970
free it'll probably be a little painful

1355
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,200
for your organization

1356
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,730
but your job is to manage those

1357
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:54,470
transitions and make them as painless as

1358
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:57,500
possible so much like with life as per

1359
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,240
Malcolm's quote you have to think about

1360
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,220
the survival of your organization's data

1361
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:03,560
at stake and really think along the

1362
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,560
lines of this model so I do think that

1363
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,930
there's there's hope attacks evolve but

1364
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:10,850
we can evolve to like we don't have to

1365
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:13,490
it's funny when I was doing research for

1366
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,370
this I just in Google you know did my

1367
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:18,740
search for before 2003 they're talking

1368
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:19,820
about the same things they're literally

1369
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,770
articles about going to conferences tons

1370
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,480
of fragmented solutions that always talk

1371
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,890
about stopping the thread and blah blah

1372
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:27,170
blah it hasn't changed much so we do

1373
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,580
need to change because that's the nature

1374
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:31,100
of our reality so I think we have to

1375
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,080
accept our grief an architect and

1376
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,050
effective and realistic defense we can't

1377
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,790
just keep languishing in anger and

1378
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:40,850
bargaining and denial so I think the

1379
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:43,010
blue pill if I put it relegate us to the

1380
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:44,720
role of a fire fighting cat who's drunk

1381
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,210
on snake oil so the belief that this

1382
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:49,220
sort of artificial equilibrium of yeah

1383
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,650
we can stop attacks it's what supports

1384
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:53,780
the fragmentation of solutions the

1385
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,000
absurd claims of like stopping all O'Dea

1386
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,890
exploits and then constant firefighting

1387
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:00,080
so it feels like the cat-and-mouse game

1388
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,060
it's more like a cruel joke which i

1389
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:03,470
think all of us would like to move on

1390
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:06,200
from that so i say instead of accepting

1391
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,880
snake oil take the red pill of

1392
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,460
resilience instead i think it will

1393
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,600
encourage us to have the right

1394
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,220
incentives to actually improve our

1395
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,950
strategies going forward i like to close

1396
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,540
with this quote for a reminder for all

1397
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,880
of us goes back again Colin talked about

1398
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,980
the security nihilism of oh well

1399
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,450
attackers can still get around it

1400
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:25,040
whatever that's not how you think about

1401
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,020
it it's good enough is good enough good

1402
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,330
enough beats perfect that's life very

1403
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:31,550
little is perfect in life so you need to

1404
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:34,250
operate that way as well with that thank

1405
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:35,830
you

1406
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:39,460
[Applause]

1407
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:42,800
