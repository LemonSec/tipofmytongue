3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,770
my name is food as Mike just said I come

4
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,540
from from Norway I work at Telenor which

5
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,120
is sort of the belle of Norway I've been

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,660
there for three years and I am helping

7
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,230
build a global search sock service for

8
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,120
talent in Asia Central Europe and new

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,910
Nordiques and before that I did seven

10
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,890
years at the national cert basically

11
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,910
hunting apt and I'm I used to be a

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,829
techie once when I was young and

13
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,590
beautiful I promise I was young and

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:02,130
beautiful I'm not really that anymore so

15
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,810
I and I'm not a developer even though I

16
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,840
I come from a developer background so I

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,550
cannot do stuff like assembly line and

18
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,660
I'm not going to be the cool guy you

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,670
know I reverse this cool malware what I

20
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,940
do most of my time is to think about how

21
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,420
we should work to become more effective

22
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,120
and that is was that's what's this talk

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,479
is about this is a bunch of models that

24
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,080
I think is useful for an incident

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,049
response team when you want to try to

26
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,000
become more effective at combating

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,090
advanced threats and taking the red pill

28
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,979
of attacker eviction that's like that's

29
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,670
the sexy title but this is the boring

30
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,250
title how to structure your thinking

31
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,890
when countering espionage and sabotage

32
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,909
from apt so little too long to be have

33
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,280
as my title but that's what this talk is

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,909
about and we're going to look

35
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,740
specifically at sort of how you are

36
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,170
going to attempt to evict mission-driven

37
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,509
you know and well-organized adversaries

38
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,590
which of course translates into your own

39
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,850
coz welcome the NSA you know the

40
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,980
Russians the Chinese the Israelis the

41
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,140
Iranians you know the the nation-states

42
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,100
and contractors of the world that is

43
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,930
task weed getting into your networks and

44
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,610
do stuff that you don't want them to do

45
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,760
there

46
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,870
so we're talking incident response

47
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,760
rights and this is the very can you see

48
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,650
this yeah I think should be particular

49
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,900
so this by the way this is how this is

50
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,270
how much lives are going to look I

51
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,790
cannot be bothered spending three months

52
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,349
making you know cool word art or

53
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:48,330
graphics in PowerPoint so I just draw

54
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,080
them and I import the pictures I hope

55
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,010
you're okay with that so this is this is

56
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,360
a simplified incident right

57
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,849
you're breached then you detect it you

58
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:02,220
analyze it for a while and then you try

59
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,810
to kick the attacker out and everyone is

60
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,630
happy and of course it's not even

61
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,220
remotely as simple as that and I'm

62
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,750
you're not supposed to read all this

63
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,459
it's just there to tell you no it's more

64
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,890
complicated because there's a whole lot

65
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,230
of planning going into an operation that

66
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,660
ends up being an apt attack in your

67
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,480
infrastructure but at some point you're

68
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,430
breached and then you don't know

69
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,250
anything for I don't know weeks months

70
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,799
years sometimes and then you discover

71
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,989
and that's what other people call dwell

72
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:33,450
time you know between compromise and you

73
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,540
detecting it and then you you you follow

74
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,950
all kinds of best practices and you

75
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,750
don't do anything until you've analyzed

76
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,760
and scoped the incident and then you

77
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,290
think oh I'm really clever and I'm going

78
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,030
to kick them out but somewhere in the

79
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,950
middle of that one of your analysts

80
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,660
uploaded a sample virustotal and the

81
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,120
attackers got wind of your you know that

82
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,609
you know about it so they spent their

83
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,260
the rest of the time planning how to

84
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,750
resist your eviction right and then you

85
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,459
think okay I'm good to kick them out and

86
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,170
you try and you think oh now the

87
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,750
attackers lost access but did you

88
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,790
succeed did you really kick them out and

89
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,459
what about when I try to re-enter the

90
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:09,510
point is there is a lot of uncertainty

91
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,120
here when dealing with quote-unquote apt

92
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,100
and advanced attacks targeted attacks

93
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,380
where everyone call it when you're

94
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,060
responding that there's just a lot of

95
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,090
uncertainty it's actually surprisingly

96
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,910
hard to know whether or not you're ready

97
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,460
to try to kick out such an attacker and

98
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,299
I guess this is

99
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,349
there's a sort of the problem statement

100
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:43,870
of this talk in a way or the problem and

101
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,310
that these models I'm going to present

102
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,409
is going to try to help you tackle that

103
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:51,430
is to deal with this uncertainty to have

104
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,349
a better foundation to make good

105
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:58,330
judgments all of you of course know

106
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,159
Department of Homeland Security I'm sure

107
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:02,759
a lot of you especially your coz guys

108
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,580
even know Chris Patera personally they

109
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,099
have an excellent presentation out about

110
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:10,990
best practices and communists missteps

111
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,360
when you're dealing with well they call

112
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,229
it major incidents the point is that one

113
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:21,699
of the within the missteps section there

114
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:24,280
is a lot about not acting too soon like

115
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,800
you know be careful before you act

116
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,060
because you don't want to tip off your

117
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,940
attacker until you are ready to you know

118
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,729
effectively kick them out so unlike will

119
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:35,530
are unlike whether for instance our

120
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,080
Terrier bleeding which there is no too

121
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,520
soon when you're trying to stopping a

122
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,270
bleeding when it comes to countering apt

123
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:48,699
there is actually a too soon right but

124
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:52,560
how do you know when the right time is

125
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,319
this comes back to the uncertainty and

126
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,240
yeah you want to try to reduce the

127
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,919
uncertainty before you act

128
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:05,409
not because it's like you whether it's

129
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:07,449
the to soon thing or something else you

130
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:09,940
want to make sure that you don't have

131
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,770
too much uncertainty when you decide to

132
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:19,180
act and that means you have to

133
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,840
understand the attacker you need to

134
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,979
understand what's going on anyway

135
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:26,529
infrastructure right so I will start off

136
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:28,419
by looking at somebody I call it apt

137
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:31,210
patterns so coming from a developer

138
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,099
background at least it's like everything

139
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:35,020
is patterns you know so let's look at

140
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,199
some apt patterns to better understand

141
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,229
what's going on and of course I was

142
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:42,930
telling a friend about this before and

143
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,729
she was going you know half the room is

144
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:47,139
going to be CSE right you don't have to

145
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:49,000
tell them up they tell them about apt

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,510
but

147
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,270
so bear with me and if you think I'm

148
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:56,050
wrong you let me know but yeah let's

149
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,440
start off so the first pattern of sorts

150
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,710
is that when it comes to intrusions into

151
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,480
your network I tend to think of them as

152
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,270
you know one of two either it's a sting

153
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,900
operation

154
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,150
you know sometimes called smash-and-grab

155
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,300
you just go in very targeted you steal

156
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,280
something and you're out and the other

157
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,720
one is where you sort of go in and you

158
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,400
actually infiltrate the infrastructure

159
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,010
with the intention of staying there for

160
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,080
a while and the reason I have like

161
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,720
fourth examples up here is because you

162
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,980
can have like a really simple

163
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,930
smash-and-grab where sort of you fish a

164
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,480
specific person you get onto that

165
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,340
person's computer and you let you know

166
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,140
you're expected to find some emails and

167
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,020
some documents on his servers user

168
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,080
profile and then you grab that and

169
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,490
you're done and the other one is like

170
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,960
you go in and you're sort of spread out

171
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,360
a little bit but you're very specific

172
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,740
goal with while you were you there and

173
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,590
once you get it you go out as opposed to

174
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,040
if you gonna you know go sort of a

175
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,540
persistent infiltration but then again

176
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,410
you have like the small footprint

177
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,590
persistent infiltration and you have the

178
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,360
the kind where you hear about sometimes

179
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,410
you know full compromised like

180
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,440
everything is compromised so that's sort

181
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,420
of that's how I think of intrusion

182
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,980
patterns when it comes to targeted

183
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:17,890
attacks and this I guess is something

184
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,330
that I don't need to explain to you guys

185
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,630
but it's here anyway like this is the

186
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:27,250
typical quote-unquote apt operation they

187
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,390
have some foothold in your

188
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,310
infrastructure here with three nodes

189
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,810
three compromised nodes talking to a

190
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,090
situ and they're gonna that's gonna be

191
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,500
the bridgehead that they're gonna use

192
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,630
most of the time so if you detect it

193
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,880
these guys here you're gonna see that

194
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,140
most of the the work they're doing

195
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,490
they're doing through these three

196
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,890
breach ads but if you sort of come if

197
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,590
you find this command and control

198
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,210
channel you find these three clients and

199
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,190
you go oh wow I got apt you gotta clean

200
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,320
this up fast and you clean this up and

201
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,620
then you dodged that bullet you sort of

202
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,970
missed the point right because these

203
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,370
kinds of operations they're gonna have

204
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,590
one or two you know backup small backup

205
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,190
clusters

206
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,480
compromise clients with different

207
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,200
malware different SI toos different IPS

208
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,280
they're gonna have they're gonna have a

209
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,080
web shell on a web server somewhere to

210
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,360
get back in if you kick them out they

211
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,710
have probably you know if you don't have

212
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,450
to factor authentication they will have

213
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,190
harvested some VPN credentials to get

214
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,160
back in through VPN and something really

215
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,400
cool that we've seen is installing

216
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,210
what's on Windows Exchange is called a

217
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,910
transport agent which is where you can

218
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,210
you can you can create a DLL that will

219
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,640
you can use it to filter email like so

220
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,200
spam filters for instance will be

221
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,750
implemented as a transport agent so

222
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,950
these guys they had made a transport

223
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,210
agent that would just look for some

224
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,960
magic header and if that magic had had

225
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,080
her appeared in an email they would read

226
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,120
the body of the email and execute code

227
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,460
that was in there right so even if we

228
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,140
did all the other things and we left

229
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,730
that one out I still had code execution

230
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,220
opportunities in our infrastructure so

231
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,490
onto the next one and this is actually I

232
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:11,080
realized actually last night that this

233
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,440
slide alone should probably be its own

234
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,190
presentation but this is something that

235
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,990
at least for me over the last couple of

236
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,000
years or sort of been like aha moment

237
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,180
that is when you're working at these

238
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,800
kinds of intrusions you need to realize

239
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,180
that there are several layers of them

240
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,260
and there is the access layer and I

241
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,380
learned recently that CSE's see any

242
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,950
group is called the same as an SAS tau

243
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,630
which is kind of funny because this

244
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,730
picture here just they basically took

245
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,230
their way of operating and they made it

246
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,480
their name because the a is acts

247
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,089
tailored access operations right and you

248
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:51,280
know the a that's access there you go

249
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,000
access layer that's the that's when they

250
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,860
penetrate your infrastructure and they

251
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,480
get a foothold and I'm and sort of

252
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,030
maintain persistency and backup weighs

253
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,730
in and everything and then it's sort of

254
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,370
the business layer

255
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,980
that is the tailored part I mean they're

256
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,390
in there to give access to something

257
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,030
right so they have tailored their access

258
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,160
so that they can get access to database

259
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,550
a B and C and I work at a telco and

260
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,190
turns out the big intelligence agencies

261
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,920
are really interested in what in the

262
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,380
public debates with NSA in the u.s. is

263
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,720
called communication metadata but

264
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,460
basically who called who one for how

265
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,720
long and from where so part of the the

266
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,210
tailoring on the access layer will be to

267
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,730
make it easy to extract that kind of

268
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:43,500
information from us as a telco right and

269
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,170
then it's the I call the mission layer

270
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,730
but I should have called the operations

271
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,780
layer because then it would have

272
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,240
actually been tau operation because

273
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,520
that's like why what are you doing you

274
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,230
cannot observe this directly you have to

275
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,450
sort of deduce what that is but we

276
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,890
analyze it so let's skip ahead here so

277
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,450
again don't try to read this I'll put

278
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,860
the slide deck online this is for your

279
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,350
reviewing afterwards but what's

280
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,350
important to understand you need to make

281
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,150
sure that you are able to distinguish

282
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,270
between what is basically what I've

283
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,150
started calling evil sysadmin like that

284
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,060
it's just the attackers sysadmin just

285
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,690
admitting their access you know so a lot

286
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,160
of the activity that you will actually

287
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,260
observe when you are analyzing an apt

288
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,600
intrusion it's just gonna be sis

289
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,140
saddening of the access that they have

290
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,480
based on sort of land of origin and sort

291
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,700
of how their play books look they will

292
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,080
come in in the morning just to make sure

293
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,720
everything is up pinging all the systems

294
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,690
they're supposed to access to you know

295
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,370
try to query a database just to see that

296
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,380
this still can sort of query it okay

297
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,210
okay so good and then they don't do

298
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,130
anything for the rest of the day maybe

299
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,560
and tell us sometimes they come back in

300
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,630
and oh I've got a task I'm gonna extract

301
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,950
this data and then they go in and they

302
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,130
just query in the extracted data so you

303
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,470
need to distinguish these two types of

304
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:09,540
activities because when you're going to

305
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,320
plan your response it isn't so on the

306
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,030
technical side it's important of course

307
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,240
they're full but when people say scope

308
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,940
during

309
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,890
incident like this basically what they

310
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:24,160
often mean is is scoping the access now

311
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,990
right the compromised assets and

312
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:30,010
identities but I think we should focus a

313
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,220
lot more on figuring out not just what

314
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,680
the access looks like but what are they

315
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,080
actually going after like try to

316
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,940
identify as assess down to the right

317
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,380
there and you can't probably cannot see

318
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,840
like try to identify the attackers

319
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,610
critical pathways to their

320
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,310
mission-critical data which in the green

321
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,800
thing is the green layer there is the

322
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,290
databases right try to identify why they

323
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,870
built this access you know and at least

324
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,940
make sure that whatever you do you try

325
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,860
to secure those because that's what

326
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,520
they're after

327
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,170
who cares which laptops and servers

328
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,110
they're wrong it's it's the data sources

329
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,610
that you need to protect first and

330
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:11,020
foremost so let's move on as I said this

331
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,970
could probably be its own presentation

332
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,100
so we don't have time for that okay so

333
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,680
why why are you being attacked in the

334
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,600
first place that is also something that

335
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,600
can I don't know baffle people having

336
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,650
worked with this kind of incident

337
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,590
response for almost a decade I've had a

338
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,000
lot of conversation with people who just

339
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,740
have one why why are they attacking me I

340
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,560
don't get it I don't have anything

341
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,690
interesting which of course is never

342
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:42,340
true and what I'm sort of where I always

343
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,530
circle back to is that if you're being

344
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,280
hit by targeted attacks like this there

345
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,460
is there exists an adverse adversarial

346
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,410
adversarial relationship somewhere that

347
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:01,210
you are relevant to that is the only

348
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,280
reason you're seeing capabilities like

349
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,200
this deployed against you if there is no

350
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,210
adversarial relationship between two

351
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,220
parties or more somewhere you don't see

352
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,720
this you don't get this in your network

353
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,790
if that doesn't exist and we we tend in

354
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,830
a security community to say oh you have

355
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,020
an adversary problem and then basically

356
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,780
what people are talking about is the CNE

357
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,310
teams you know the Taos of the world

358
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,850
they mean like the hand key on keyboard

359
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,810
operators doing the collection

360
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,160
of course that's that's not your

361
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,720
adversary at least not the one that has

362
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,939
an adversarial relationship with you the

363
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:41,689
adversary is someone else like for since

364
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:44,269
we're in Canada I guess Nortel is a good

365
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:47,360
example right it wasn't three PLA that

366
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,809
was nor Charles adversary it was I'm

367
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:52,189
just gonna go out and say it Huawei

368
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:56,149
right and they they pillaged Nortel for

369
00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:00,290
what a decade and if you thought that

370
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,379
the 3p Li guys was if that was creepy

371
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,100
libel it was at least the Chinese was

372
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,449
the adversary you sort of missed the

373
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:10,790
point right because the adversary was

374
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,620
actually one of the competitors who

375
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,499
benefited from this so this I think so

376
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:18,170
so a lot of people of course all you

377
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,370
guys who work in the intelligence

378
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,069
community you get this but surprising

379
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:25,189
amount of people working in the security

380
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:28,519
industry doesn't really get this and of

381
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,230
course if you go to your managers in IT

382
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,889
in IT operations they absolutely do not

383
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:35,360
have this perspective and I think this

384
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,069
isn't a perspective that is important to

385
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:41,089
bring in during incident response and

386
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:42,709
yeah sometimes this is you sometimes

387
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:44,269
it's actually you who have the

388
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,769
adversarial relationship that is

389
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:48,410
relevant for this attack on you but

390
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,329
other times you're just a random little

391
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:52,519
random but other times you're you are

392
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,709
targeted because you can give access to

393
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,629
the final targets and again coming from

394
00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:01,309
a telco the reason that all the major

395
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:03,110
intelligence services of the world are

396
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,179
super interested in telcos isn't because

397
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:06,709
they really want to target us but but

398
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,780
because we give them access to something

399
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,319
that they really really like who calls

400
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,530
to positioning data on people yeah so a

401
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,780
so telco we for the really really target

402
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,130
that there are really sort of the scary

403
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,419
threats out there like the really

404
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:25,549
capable organisations attacking us

405
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:27,589
this is the case they are not really

406
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,130
after us but they're after our customers

407
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,840
and being able to distinguish this

408
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,820
during incident response is are you a

409
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,230
direct target or you're sort of an

410
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,940
indirect target is also important for

411
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,679
how you think when you plan your

412
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,419
response like what is the best way to

413
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:43,899
respond

414
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,730
so and okay I'm sorry very crowded or

415
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:53,020
unclear slide but let me try to explain

416
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,770
it as best I can so you see the

417
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,600
Intelligence Agency up there in yellow

418
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,420
and you have the CNE attack group you

419
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,920
know the attack team or what everyone

420
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,480
call it some kind of a projects

421
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,750
operation in town right running an ops

422
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:16,450
against let's say Telenor a lot of the

423
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,250
time when we respond to this we are only

424
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,670
sort of responding to basically the

425
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,340
access the access layer right we are

426
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,500
responding to compromised assets in IT

427
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,370
that's what we respond to only the most

428
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,590
mature of companies and I haven't to be

429
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,360
honest Matt a lot of companies who

430
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,480
really are doing this responds to what

431
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,370
is actually the biggest risk here and

432
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,920
that is the business side of things so

433
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,750
at least where let's say let's use

434
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,550
corporate espionage as an example like

435
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:52,900
and Nortel right it's it's the it's not

436
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,080
hell's competitor that is the big issue

437
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,930
here right it's the impact on business

438
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,520
that is the big issue it's not the

439
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:08,800
compromised assets but I'm gonna yeah

440
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,110
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say

441
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,580
I think that most insurance response

442
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,480
team of the world or are just doing the

443
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,290
the the sort of the response to the

444
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,470
access layer you know the attack on IT

445
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,170
operations and not the other side and I

446
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,940
think that should change if we want to

447
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,580
if we want to be more effective at

448
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,520
countering that the risks that these

449
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,690
threats supposed to us okay so that was

450
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:42,850
the apt patterns anyone fall asleep not

451
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:47,410
yet not too much gorilla so we're going

452
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,600
to have a very short intermission sort

453
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,560
of no more slides with the

454
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,710
with diagrams on them for a little while

455
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,190
just gonna make some I'm gonna assert

456
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,230
something here because now we've been

457
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,730
talking about apt intrusions and sort of

458
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,680
started talking about how to respond to

459
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,850
it

460
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,210
and a lot of the time we are when we

461
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,010
talk about this in the security

462
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,470
community we're talking about kicking

463
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,650
them out their master attacker you know

464
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,960
kicking them out and I think we need to

465
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,590
start talking about keeping them out

466
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,840
right and this I actually believe that

467
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,850
this is an important mindset changed

468
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,310
that that needs to happen that become

469
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,690
because kicking something out that is

470
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,850
like oh there's a leaky pipe on my

471
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,620
kitchen I'm gonna wipe the floor that is

472
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,740
kicking out right there keeping out is

473
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,550
oh wait I have a leaky I have a leaky

474
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,860
plumbing thing here let's fix that and

475
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,080
then we're gonna clean the floor but

476
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,240
once I clean it they're not gonna come

477
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,980
right it's not gonna start leaking again

478
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,440
immediately right so I think we need a

479
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,020
mindset change where we are saying we're

480
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,640
going to keep them out how we're gonna

481
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,250
keep these guys out so that you do all

482
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,480
the things you need to keep them out

483
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,460
then you kick them out instead of just

484
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,840
identify what's there and there and

485
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,400
there and there kick and you haven't

486
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:15,800
done anything to resist reentry and this

487
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,990
actually goes back to this kind of

488
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,260
cluttered IT ops versus business

489
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,490
response because the first one sort of

490
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,500
just responding to the access into your

491
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,930
network and helping IT ops clean up the

492
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:34,580
network I hope we at some point can say

493
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,780
that was the old way that we did

494
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,370
Incident Response and that we are and

495
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,080
everyone is talking about mitigating

496
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,760
risk but I haven't really seen a lot of

497
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,460
companies actually do it it's easy to

498
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,040
talk about but bringing in a bringing in

499
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,780
business and trying to figure out what

500
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,330
the business risk actually is from these

501
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,750
incidents I don't know but we need to so

502
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,770
we should yeah we should keep talking

503
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,330
about it but we should also try to

504
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,610
figure out a way how to actually do it

505
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:11,010
sorry and then all this talking about

506
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,220
cleaning up I think miss is a very

507
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,900
important point when it comes to

508
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,510
incident response toward in these

509
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,500
situations and that is that sometimes

510
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,830
letting them operate might be the best

511
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,630
way to mitigate the big risks you're

512
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,380
facing and I've talked about this with a

513
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,320
lot of incident responders and way more

514
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,470
than half goes like are you crazy we

515
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,300
would never be allowed to do that how

516
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,070
could you be allowed to do that this is

517
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:48,720
insane and maybe it is but sometimes if

518
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,310
you want to if you want if you want to

519
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:53,310
counter the business risk you cannot act

520
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,720
immediately on the IT operations risk

521
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,190
because if you do that if you act

522
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,260
immediately on the IT operations side

523
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,570
the access side of things you're not

524
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,120
even gonna come close to figure out the

525
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,200
other stuff so when I hear people say

526
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,480
that yeah you know let it run for a

527
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,700
while most of the time it's because we

528
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,520
need to scope the access layer the blue

529
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,410
layer you know the IT ops side of things

530
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,690
so that we can identify everything that

531
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,310
it come is compromised so that when we

532
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,820
clean up we clean up everything a lot

533
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,440
more seldom do I hear people say let it

534
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,060
run for a while so we figure out what

535
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,580
they're doing because most of the time

536
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,900
when people start extra trading

537
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,500
sensitive data it's like stop but if you

538
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,240
don't let that happen you're not going

539
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,970
to be able to figure out what the

540
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:45,600
business risk is but I see why this is

541
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
scary

542
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,870
my position on this is that it doesn't

543
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,850
matter if you let them keep at it for a

544
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,560
while or not because even if you kick

545
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,880
them out they're going to be back in and

546
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,610
there's gonna be a new dwell time so and

547
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,290
during that time they're gonna do this

548
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,540
anyway so you might as well just let

549
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,220
them do it while you're looking at it

550
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,780
because then you can figure out what the

551
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,630
big thing is and maybe actually change

552
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,700
something on the tactical or strategic

553
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,750
level that will mitigate

554
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:23,030
bigger risk so be bold so how can we

555
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,070
even come close to making decisions like

556
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,860
that we started out by talking about

557
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,110
well okay I was doing the talking but we

558
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,860
were all together right

559
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:36,020
I was talking about the uncertainty in

560
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,590
these kinds of situations and how do you

561
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,330
make these decisions with so much

562
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,880
uncertainty well the answer is of course

563
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,350
to try to reduce the uncertainty so now

564
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,510
we're going to go back to a lot of these

565
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,750
hand-drawn diagrams because the way I

566
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,480
think we should do this is to apply a

567
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,299
lot more analytical models to our work

568
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:03,140
you know structured analytical thinking

569
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,450
that's a thing so there are a couple of

570
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:06,919
really good books out there on

571
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:10,340
intelligence analysis but not that much

572
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,390
on sort of how do you how do you apply

573
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:19,010
those thoughts for our kind our kind of

574
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:23,470
work so let's see how I am doing on time

575
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:27,820
actually not quite bad that's good

576
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:32,390
because now comes a lot of I guess what

577
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,840
was here now was sort of I was up until

578
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,120
now this I guess wasn't surprising like

579
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,380
it wasn't yeah I've read that before

580
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,700
I've thought that before yeah of course

581
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,980
it's like that I hope we can continue

582
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,679
like that but but the what comes now is

583
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,200
just imaginations that this comes from

584
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,299
my imagination I have to be quite honest

585
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,730
I have no idea if this is actually going

586
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,230
to work because I'm still creating this

587
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,179
basically and sort of this is a work in

588
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:01,760
progress we are going to implement this

589
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,559
and try to do this where I work in

590
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:06,049
Telenor search but we haven't come that

591
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:07,730
far yet so your basic this is hot off

592
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,460
the press it's just so if it's rubbish

593
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,250
you can blame me if it's good you can

594
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:18,860
say our telemetry so first thing this is

595
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,080
the super simple stuff like I mean you

596
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,630
need to make sure that when you respond

597
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:27,549
to this you figure out the dwell time

598
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,980
I'd say short well time like also

599
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,640
between intrusion and detection that's

600
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,360
like hours to days medium let's say days

601
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,330
to weeks and longest months to years and

602
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:46,190
if you can catch something and you

603
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,240
figure out very

604
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,860
clear that yeah I think you know I think

605
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,140
we actually caught this pretty fast yeah

606
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,710
go for it you know just go after them

607
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,390
and try to clean up as fast as you can

608
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,510
because they haven't been able to you

609
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,780
know infiltrate you properly yet they

610
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,190
haven't been able to damage you yet so

611
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,530
you might as well you know try to kick

612
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:10,460
them out and prevent them from gaining

613
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,920
insight and foothold and providing or

614
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,650
giving you now crossing your damage if

615
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,740
it's days two weeks yeah well then it

616
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,870
depends a lot on your team your area is

617
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,090
response team and the kind of

618
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,280
capabilities that they have if you're

619
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,290
able to have a high operational tempo

620
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:30,530
you know you have a lot of you have a

621
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,720
lot of data a lot of telemetry and you

622
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,240
have good orchestration you can probably

623
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,480
catch up with these guys and maybe you

624
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,840
know go for a clean up but if you find

625
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,490
something and they have been in there

626
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:48,020
for years and you hear these stories all

627
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,650
the time I have in my career heard of

628
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,800
this or seen this many many times that

629
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,510
when you start looking into an intuition

630
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,760
like this it turns out that there are

631
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,160
traces of the attacker for as far back

632
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,700
as you're able to go in your log sources

633
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,510
so you know yeah they were in there in

634
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:11,000
2013 at least because that's as far back

635
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,530
yes we have data and then it's like okay

636
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:18,080
no matter what you do you're probably

637
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,309
not going to be able to get them out

638
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:20,960
because they and a by now probably know

639
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,460
your infrastructure better than your IT

640
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,510
operations you know they're gonna have

641
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:28,429
every password from every system there

642
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:30,260
yeah they're just gonna know you so well

643
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,820
that even if you kick them out they're

644
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,400
just gonna they're gonna have 17 ways

645
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,510
back in so then then you got it then you

646
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,010
may then you may need to you know shut

647
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,270
down and you hear you hear about this

648
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,140
from time to time you know you have

649
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,820
maybe any have to shut down the entire

650
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,440
network and just reinstall everything

651
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,110
reset everything or even worse you hear

652
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:50,690
this sometimes to just build a new data

653
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,240
center and migrate right of course it

654
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,820
depends on the threat but this is a

655
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,669
function of the dwell time as well so

656
00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:00,690
getting an idea of the dwell

657
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:05,850
time is important then back to intrusion

658
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:10,800
patterns based on what you're seeing if

659
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,960
you if you think you're more on the

660
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,060
sting operation side of things well then

661
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,940
it's easier to clean up because the

662
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,190
complexity of the infiltration is less

663
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:26,700
right or if you see traces of them being

664
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,940
everywhere it's like okay now I know now

665
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,830
that this is going to be very hard so if

666
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,400
you have a long dwell time and you see

667
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,710
you see indicators that this is like you

668
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,200
know a really heavy persistent

669
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,390
infiltration then you know okay just by

670
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:45,720
these two factors you know that this is

671
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,430
gonna be super hard at that point you

672
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:53,460
don't really have to rush in my opinion

673
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,420
it's like okay

674
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,280
these two things alone and this you

675
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,780
should actually be able to get an idea

676
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,240
of just within hours and days of your

677
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,500
investigation if you say okay we in this

678
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,180
data source we see them back to three

679
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,630
years and yeah we see them on like so

680
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,270
many systems it's not even funny already

681
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,590
now you know that you can take a step

682
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,030
back in just like okay you know what if

683
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,800
I spend a month investigating this isn't

684
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,240
what's gonna make a difference they're

685
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,070
been in for so long even if we try to

686
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,390
kick them up now they're gonna have so

687
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,030
many ways back in we might as well take

688
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,090
our time and this is how we can just

689
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,370
these two very simple concepts you can

690
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,220
use to make decisions on how you want to

691
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,430
respond and even better hopefully you

692
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,160
can you can use these concepts to get

693
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,670
management approval for doing it because

694
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,350
that is going to be the big issue right

695
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,420
yeah we are totally compromised and we

696
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,520
don't want to do anything because that's

697
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,050
what's going to sound like we don't want

698
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,640
to do anything what do you mean you want

699
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,100
don't want to do anything no okay so I

700
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,870
didn't really not do anything but I mean

701
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,860
we're going to kick them out you're

702
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,820
gonna do a lot of stuff we're gonna

703
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,960
analyze we're gonna try to figure out

704
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,140
what's going on but sort of having that

705
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,640
conversation with upper management is

706
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,350
super hard but I think just these two

707
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,240
simple counts concepts these two simple

708
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,790
models can actually help you start that

709
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,950
conversation and maybe even

710
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:17,100
okay I guess I understand you explained

711
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,840
it to me so yeah okay I'll give you a

712
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,950
month or two or three so on to something

713
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:28,380
a little bit more elaborate kind of

714
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,520
random name

715
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,700
I like 3x3 matrix is so this was called

716
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,980
the thread type matrix and that is you

717
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,960
want to try to figure out what kind of

718
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,110
threat actor you're up against

719
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,820
what kind of motivations they have for

720
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,640
being in your infrastructure this ties

721
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,610
back to for instance the difference

722
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,800
between being a direct target and being

723
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,600
an indirect target like are you are you

724
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,800
attacked because you can provide access

725
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,700
to the real target or are you the real

726
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,780
targets like for the Taos of the world

727
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,530
attacking telcos like Telenor we are an

728
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:11,640
indirect target but all the times when

729
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,950
other threat actors attack it's

730
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,020
industrial espionage and so we are the

731
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,810
target and that sort of that so that is

732
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,790
a different kind of threat type sort of

733
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:31,200
different profile and I decided to

734
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,560
divide this into strategic tactical

735
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,170
operational and strategic that means now

736
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:39,110
and let's start at the bottom actually

737
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:42,390
operational means they are attacking you

738
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:45,150
because of operational needs in the snow

739
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,310
so so nice to be in Canada because I

740
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,140
have so many examples to give in the

741
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,510
snow mix there is actually something

742
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,630
about sorry CSE guys there is actually

743
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:58,110
something about how CSE is doing this

744
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,210
and at the time which is probably many

745
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,040
years ago they had like a surge two

746
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,870
times a year where they were just used

747
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:08,179
SIGINT find runner bro

748
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,600
you know internet exposed services and

749
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,060
exploit them and sort of you know pull

750
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,350
them into what we in the old days called

751
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,780
the botnet kind of thing you know

752
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,490
actually about that just get access to

753
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,160
it right put web shops on a fella know

754
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,050
and create what they call in the sort of

755
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,180
military speak orbs operational relay

756
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,160
boxes and then we just sort of gather

757
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,840
you know thousands and thousands of

758
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,500
these as a resource you know just to use

759
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,570
as proxy networks and see to service and

760
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:40,200
whatever so if if you are compromised

761
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,110
and you think that this is what's going

762
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,940
on based on based on everything that you

763
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,190
see around the compromised you think

764
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,900
that ok so I've actually just been

765
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,400
attacked because they want they want to

766
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,970
use my service as their infrastructure

767
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:56,400
well then I'd say you're up against sort

768
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,040
of an operational threat or they're not

769
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,810
operational threat but the threat actors

770
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:05,820
motive is operational that means that if

771
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,950
you just clean that up right now there

772
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,168
is no need to that there is no and you

773
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:11,460
patched your vulnerabilities there is

774
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,918
actually no reason to believe that that

775
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,510
threat actor is going to come back in

776
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,690
even though it's an apt there is no

777
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,330
there is no motivation for them to try

778
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,250
to be persistent on your web server it

779
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,070
was just an opportunistic target right

780
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:28,050
so then is the tactical motivation that

781
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,918
is more so a lot of espionage is done

782
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,960
corporate espionage is done because of

783
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,760
contract negotiations and stuff like

784
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,110
that and one of the more interesting

785
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:43,980
concrete examples I've talked to people

786
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:50,780
about is someone who lost north of 120

787
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:53,520
million Canadian dollars in a contract

788
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,690
negotiation because of an apt one breach

789
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:00,660
where they would you know steal

790
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,940
everything really regarding the the

791
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,660
contract negotiations and the when that

792
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,850
company piece together what had happened

793
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,280
and they made sort of an estimated how

794
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,570
much money they lost because of that

795
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:17,750
there was 120 million Canadian dollars

796
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:21,619
no not million yeah

797
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:28,770
yeah 100 and 120,000 Canadian no I'm

798
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:29,970
trying to do conversion in my head I

799
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,079
should have done this before I should

800
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,730
have the number down here sorry eight

801
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,849
hundred thousand eight hundred million

802
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:38,130
kroners and it's six point five whatever

803
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,490
I'm sorry a big number that's the point

804
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:45,119
yeah why did I even try to do this I'm

805
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,150
sorry you know I want to get it right

806
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:52,980
no one cares so that's the kind of a

807
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,440
tactical motivation where there is a

808
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,359
there is a specific objective and there

809
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,420
is a time frame most of the time and the

810
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,030
attacker they date they attack that they

811
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,809
infiltrate you to try to support some

812
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:11,490
kind of young tactical objective and

813
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,140
then it's a strategic one and for

814
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,119
instance go back to you know the big

815
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,130
intelligence services and telcos they

816
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,289
have a strategic motivate motivation for

817
00:36:19,289 --> 00:36:22,020
attacking telcos like Telenor because

818
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:28,920
they they want access sort of our the

819
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,779
access that we can provide them to

820
00:36:33,779 --> 00:36:36,180
metadata phone calls and positioning

821
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,970
it's just it's sort of a strategic

822
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:42,119
resource I guess for them so looking at

823
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,549
an intrusion you should try to figure

824
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:46,920
out what kind of motivation is behind

825
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,029
this what kind of threat are you up

826
00:36:51,029 --> 00:36:53,130
against like are they is strategically

827
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,779
motivated are you tactically motivated

828
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,510
already operationally motivated as I

829
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,680
said if they're if you think they're

830
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,510
operationally motivated just kick them

831
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,609
out and that should be it

832
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:04,740
if they're if you think they're

833
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,140
tactically motivated well now you know

834
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,660
they're on they're on the clock like I

835
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,029
said if you have it's a full deep

836
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,940
compromise that has lasted for years

837
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,980
there's no rush well if you think that

838
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,869
your attacker is tactically motivated

839
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,520
the rest of the Risso rush because they

840
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,410
are on the clock so if you can slow them

841
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:25,140
down they might not be able to hurt you

842
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,500
right well if they're if their

843
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,880
motivation is strategic like for

844
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,029
instance they're so the Chinese

845
00:37:33,029 --> 00:37:34,780
espionage on

846
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,330
the US and the rest of the world with

847
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:39,910
the apt one guys that was more

848
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:42,040
strategical strategically motivated

849
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,850
right just get everyone's secrets and

850
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,530
see if we can use some sort of

851
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:51,210
motivation at least part of it was that

852
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:57,340
it seems so if you're doing reso so I

853
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,230
mean like the different defense industry

854
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,310
right they're gonna have a lot of

855
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,920
strategically motivated attackers going

856
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,220
at them because everyone wants to know

857
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,570
you're the newest weapons technology

858
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:11,650
right and then of course you should use

859
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,090
the right to figure out what kind of how

860
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,040
capable is this attacker so low medium

861
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:22,450
high yeah basically the examples that I

862
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:26,440
I gave so if you have a highly capable

863
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,150
and strategically motivated adversary

864
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,190
attacking you or sorry I shouldn't say

865
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,010
adversary intelligence capability

866
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,440
infiltrating you that really puts the

867
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,750
eight that the P an apt those are going

868
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,130
to be the guys who are going to be

869
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:46,720
really really persistent well if you

870
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,700
have someone that is in the sort of low

871
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,770
capability spectrum and you think

872
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:54,430
they're operationally motivated there's

873
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,810
not going to be a P in there at all

874
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:58,540
right I mean so the whole term apt

875
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,880
doesn't really apply to this I've just

876
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,680
been using it because now everyone just

877
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:07,690
uses apts you know espionage but the P

878
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:09,760
an apt belongs up in the upper right

879
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,880
corner and and sort of figuring this out

880
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,490
getting an idea of the attacker based on

881
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:18,370
these just to simple access it's gonna

882
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,770
is going to inform your decision making

883
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,810
an instant response right because when I

884
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,340
said you can take a step back yeah well

885
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,060
if you think they're strategically

886
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,650
motivated and they're highly capable

887
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,050
there is nothing you and they have been

888
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,080
there for a long time that well time and

889
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,250
then they've gone for a sort of a deep

890
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:37,840
full infiltration you you don't need to

891
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,710
hurry because you're not gonna be able

892
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,510
to really you're not gonna be able to

893
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,880
get them out and there is no rush well

894
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,640
if it's tactical again well if it's calm

895
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,280
negotiation you think they're well fight

896
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,960
them as hard as you can until the

897
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,690
contract negotiations are done and then

898
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,270
they're probably just leave

899
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:02,050
so risk type matrix next next thing so

900
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:06,220
now it's time to turn the perspective

901
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,920
from the attacker to to assess the

902
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,660
target

903
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,520
so again operational tactical strategic

904
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,910
but this time it means what kind of risk

905
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,730
is this posing to us is it an

906
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:23,280
operational risk and by that I mean like

907
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,810
having malware on your servers is it

908
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:28,030
gonna make them unstable isn't gonna eat

909
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,040
resources or your service is gonna go

910
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,980
down because of this tactical well now

911
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,630
it actually matches pretty well to the

912
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,840
attacker like contract negotiations you

913
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,610
know is this project gonna fail because

914
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:45,850
of this are we gonna is this is this

915
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:49,240
procurement process going to be twice as

916
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,680
expensive because of this you know that

917
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,600
kind of thing a strategic is more like

918
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,240
oh that we lose all our R&D oh wow that

919
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,500
wasn't good and then just low medium and

920
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:06,370
high that's in the risk so we're not

921
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,990
going to read all this I basically just

922
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,300
sat down said this but you can find this

923
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,470
again in the slides when I put them

924
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,280
online the important thing here in this

925
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,230
in the diagram now is is what's on the

926
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:20,080
right side because on the operational

927
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,330
risk you're going to talk to IT

928
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,070
operations because I mean that's very

929
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:26,260
nice right I mean this is all malware

930
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,480
driven and you know it it's I access to

931
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,530
your IT systems so operational risk you

932
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:35,500
don't talk to IT if it's a tactical

933
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,970
business risk well you have to talk to

934
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:39,340
business you know that's going to be a

935
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,660
difficult conversation because they've

936
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,690
never heard of apt before and then if

937
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:45,580
it's a strategic risk well you have to

938
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,260
talk to upper management because then

939
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,780
those are the guys through whose job it

940
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,600
is you know to to make the strategies

941
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,340
and manage the risk to these strategies

942
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:58,570
and I'm gonna assert that as a community

943
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,320
we are doing all

944
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,230
locked her work down there just you know

945
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,740
on the operational side of things even

946
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,870
even if we know all this other stuff

947
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:12,050
exists we still mostly just talked to IT

948
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,560
right I wish someone would you know get

949
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,270
up and say you know you know seriously

950
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:20,180
no no no we're doing all of this but I

951
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:24,170
can honestly say that even though I have

952
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:27,740
created this slide deck I haven't been

953
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:33,759
doing this a lot more aspiring to

954
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:41,000
because as incident responders most of

955
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,810
us are technical so we go and talk to IT

956
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:48,440
and we talk technical you need different

957
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,390
kinds of skills different kinds of

958
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,370
people to go and talk risk to business

959
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:57,020
and then if you're gonna bridge the the

960
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,490
people who understand the technical side

961
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:00,020
of the risk with the people who can sort

962
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,060
of actually make sense of the business

963
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,270
risks you know there is a there is a gap

964
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:11,630
to be bridged and I'm not sure a lot of

965
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,060
t-shirts around the world or set up to

966
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,920
actually bridge that gap themselves at

967
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,910
least so next one and this this is

968
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:21,760
actually the title of the talk so what I

969
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,330
sorry Mike what I did after I submitted

970
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:28,130
this talk was that I just totally

971
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:31,370
changed it into not so in the original

972
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:34,220
talk was going to be just about this but

973
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,450
the more I worked on it the more I

974
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:37,820
realized no I need more models this is

975
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,800
just one out of several that we need you

976
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,390
know to do what I want to achieve with

977
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:45,410
this model so this is the fat pie or

978
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:47,360
seat him or whatever the cyber threat

979
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,310
intelligence matrix which is a name that

980
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,740
doesn't really mean anything but as you

981
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,990
can see fat pie is the first letters of

982
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:59,950
the two axis and how many of you have

983
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:03,170
heard about Ryan's dillion's detection

984
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:08,840
maturity level to retire after all the

985
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,990
curry or you haven't heard about it not

986
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:12,530
sure okay

987
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,970
then I I need to I need to

988
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:15,740
sort of ask one more question to figure

989
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,030
out whether or not you're just sleeping

990
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,500
or if you haven't heard about it how

991
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,060
many of you work with incident response

992
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:27,890
that was the usual five hands okay I

993
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,660
should have asked that before I started

994
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,910
and told you all this is only for

995
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,550
incidence response although this entire

996
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:38,050
talk is for incident response anyway

997
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,190
detection maturity level that is

998
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:43,490
basically you know what if you're

999
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:46,400
interested the slides are going to come

1000
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,320
online and then you can find the link to

1001
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,260
the presentation call yeah the

1002
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:52,430
presentation there and it's going to

1003
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:56,590
have links to the detection maturity

1004
00:44:56,590 --> 00:45:00,020
maturity levels but basically this is

1005
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,490
depth of knowledge when you're analyzing

1006
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:05,720
a threat what - what's depth of

1007
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,890
knowledge can you can you you know how

1008
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:11,510
far can you go like footprint that is

1009
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:14,060
the easy stuff that's IP hashes domain

1010
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,740
names whatever you know like concrete

1011
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,750
stuff that you can sometimes well what I

1012
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,339
guess you in threat Intel sharing

1013
00:45:19,339 --> 00:45:22,060
platforms which called observables

1014
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:26,450
Arsenal that's more like okay so you

1015
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:29,660
found a specific plug example so you

1016
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,580
know that they're using projects so

1017
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:34,520
using plug X as part of our Arsenal and

1018
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,839
maybe you can even say yeah they're

1019
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:38,390
using the early 2016 builder of this

1020
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:41,089
strain of projects and then tradecraft

1021
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:43,910
that is well I guess that is what makes

1022
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:46,130
most immediate sense here that's their

1023
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:48,230
processes their routines and stuff how

1024
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:50,150
did in their training how do they work

1025
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,950
how do they think how are you how do you

1026
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:54,859
structure the work and then the other

1027
00:45:54,859 --> 00:45:58,490
axis is stages of attack so that is sort

1028
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:03,410
of loosely based on the cyber kale chane

1029
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:07,880
but that is that paper by the way is so

1030
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,599
awesome and the way that Lockheed Martin

1031
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:14,510
used and I guess still uses the kill

1032
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,810
chain concept is awesome but now

1033
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:19,760
everyone seems to think that every

1034
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,550
attack in the world goes according to

1035
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:23,960
the cyber kill chain which it doesn't

1036
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,570
because that is a very malware oriented

1037
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:27,289
you know

1038
00:46:27,289 --> 00:46:29,279
penetrating your system with Mallory

1039
00:46:29,279 --> 00:46:35,670
kind of attack so I've simplified it and

1040
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:38,940
just try to make it more generic and say

1041
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,799
that if someone is going to attack you

1042
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:42,059
they're gonna first they're going to

1043
00:46:42,059 --> 00:46:44,009
prepare for it then there's gonna be an

1044
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:46,200
intrusion face and I don't have just

1045
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,569
mean exploitation you know getting code

1046
00:46:48,569 --> 00:46:50,009
running Orion system I mean the whole

1047
00:46:50,009 --> 00:46:52,589
access layer that we talked about

1048
00:46:52,589 --> 00:46:54,960
earlier right getting building

1049
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,180
access into your network and then the

1050
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:01,410
execution stage which is sort of okay

1051
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,799
using that access to to delivering on

1052
00:47:04,799 --> 00:47:07,289
their mission and their objectives so

1053
00:47:07,289 --> 00:47:12,359
what are we gonna use this for okay so I

1054
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:16,640
just told you this let's get beyond that

1055
00:47:16,759 --> 00:47:23,009
yeah so the purpose of this is to help

1056
00:47:23,009 --> 00:47:26,249
you identify knowledge gaps because if

1057
00:47:26,249 --> 00:47:28,710
you have knowledge gaps that means there

1058
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,719
is going to be uncertainty and we

1059
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:34,170
started out by you know saying we need

1060
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:35,999
to reduce uncertainty if we want to make

1061
00:47:35,999 --> 00:47:37,829
better decision as interim Incident

1062
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:40,890
Response so this is specifically put

1063
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:45,059
together to help you reduce uncertainty

1064
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:48,660
by identifying knowledge gaps so how

1065
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:55,259
okay I if you read about what not to do

1066
00:47:55,259 --> 00:47:57,299
and do during public speaking one of the

1067
00:47:57,299 --> 00:47:59,339
things that's on top of the knot not to

1068
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:00,809
do list is apologize

1069
00:48:00,809 --> 00:48:03,059
do not apologize just whatever it is

1070
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:05,430
just go I feel I have to apologize for

1071
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:07,319
this this is a bit too crowded for you

1072
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:09,989
guys to make any sense of unless you

1073
00:48:09,989 --> 00:48:12,839
have like 15 minutes later today

1074
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:16,019
after this is put online but I'm going

1075
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:17,190
to try to work you through it so don't

1076
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:21,989
try to read everything so if you have if

1077
00:48:21,989 --> 00:48:24,119
you observe that you have a hacked web

1078
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:26,400
server and someone placed a see knife

1079
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,239
web shell there

1080
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:31,410
well that is I'm at right corner by the

1081
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:32,759
way for those of you who want to sort of

1082
00:48:32,759 --> 00:48:36,690
see where I'm talking that is an

1083
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:38,539
observation that you would put in into

1084
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:40,310
you know for

1085
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:44,300
print in the intrusion phase and if

1086
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,310
someone sends you in a phishing email to

1087
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:48,830
a specific user from a specific IP that

1088
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:51,380
is also in a footprint in the intrusion

1089
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,900
phase and so forth to pick some of the

1090
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,750
other cells here like use mimikatz to

1091
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:58,400
harvest credentials from memory well

1092
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,730
that is an arsenal thing in the

1093
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,940
execution phase okay maybe it should

1094
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,530
actually based on what I just said maybe

1095
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:07,430
that should actually have been an

1096
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:08,840
intrusion face because that is basically

1097
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:16,390
and I can access an access thing so

1098
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,100
tradecraft

1099
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:23,780
uses ping - and one an IP to check if a

1100
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:27,890
host this up and then before all thing

1101
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:30,050
to the IP C share right that is a

1102
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,600
tradecraft thingy for the execution

1103
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:37,280
phase point is if you if you take all

1104
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,830
your findings and you map them according

1105
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:43,520
to this it will become immediate to you

1106
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,790
very quickly if it turns out that you

1107
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:49,490
have zero clue what is going on in the

1108
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:51,530
preparation phase like that would mean

1109
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,240
friends so so in the footprint for

1110
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,060
preparation upper left corner is like

1111
00:49:56,060 --> 00:50:00,430
register evil calm with enum thank you

1112
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,810
some of the apt one guys they just loved

1113
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:05,120
enum their like every every domain they

1114
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:10,580
register was an enum right if you know

1115
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,290
nothing about how they prepare their

1116
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:14,540
attacks against you you know you have

1117
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,880
knowledge gaps knowledge gaps that might

1118
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,800
be critical because when we are talking

1119
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,060
about preventing re-entry knowing how

1120
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,470
they setting how they set up their

1121
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:25,850
infrastructure for the next way is

1122
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:28,820
actually very important and if you when

1123
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,710
when you map all you know you see you

1124
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:32,300
know I have nothing nothing in the

1125
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:35,030
yellow column you can you can sit down

1126
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:37,430
with your managers and say you know what

1127
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:39,440
we have big knowledge gaps there's too

1128
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,180
much uncertainty here for us to actually

1129
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,800
kick these guys out now unless it's

1130
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,340
really urgent that we do so

1131
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:53,020
and you know so this the big bubble

1132
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,960
there that is one of the the

1133
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,520
observations from the last slide you can

1134
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,260
also use this to take your observations

1135
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,210
and just okay so this is what we absurd

1136
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:04,600
use projects on host set set set to

1137
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,130
query database server

1138
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:10,450
why for data type a okay projects which

1139
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:12,640
builder which train which group uses

1140
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,200
this you know you can spawn a lot of

1141
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,890
other questions host said said said okay

1142
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:19,870
how did they get onto that system why

1143
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:27,550
did I get to go to that system DB server

1144
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:32,170
why whether they get the creds can you

1145
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:34,380
use these credentials on other servers

1146
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,540
have they used this these credentials on

1147
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,640
these servers you know for every for

1148
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,230
every finding that you have you can sort

1149
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:43,030
of you can you can you can create a

1150
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:45,160
whole list in your questions that you

1151
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:48,580
possibly could answer and these will

1152
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,910
again you know map into different parts

1153
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:53,350
of the matrix and some of it will not

1154
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:55,390
even map into this but in map into some

1155
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:58,030
of the other models the point is you can

1156
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:00,910
use this to figure out if there are if

1157
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,670
there is a lot of stuff that you really

1158
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:06,550
should know before you try to kick these

1159
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:09,910
guys out that is the whole purpose of

1160
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:12,700
this is in the yellow box at the bottom

1161
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:17,290
there the fat pie is sort of its purpose

1162
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:19,720
is to sort of be able to soon canary for

1163
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,510
your response if you figure out you have

1164
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:23,890
too many knowledge gaps you probably

1165
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,990
shouldn't try to act until you fill

1166
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:28,420
those knowledge gaps and this is equally

1167
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,520
important if you figure out you have a

1168
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,810
lot of knowledge gaps that you're unable

1169
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:35,020
to close you need to figure out why

1170
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,480
maybe you actually have to rebuild some

1171
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,090
of the infrastructure before you act

1172
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:41,140
because before you do that you don't

1173
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,730
really have a defendable infrastructure

1174
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:44,080
so if you kick them out you're just

1175
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,950
gonna come straight back in

1176
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:54,489
this is just all of them combined the

1177
00:52:54,489 --> 00:52:56,859
fat by the c-team that addresses your

1178
00:52:56,859 --> 00:52:59,829
uncertainty the risk type matrix that

1179
00:52:59,829 --> 00:53:01,449
sort of says something about your

1180
00:53:01,449 --> 00:53:03,759
urgency you know do we have to act now

1181
00:53:03,759 --> 00:53:06,819
or can we wait a bit and so this is sort

1182
00:53:06,819 --> 00:53:09,989
of this is gonna be you're gonna get

1183
00:53:09,989 --> 00:53:12,849
you're gonna maybe the urgency says we

1184
00:53:12,849 --> 00:53:15,519
actually do need to act now and then the

1185
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:17,229
fat pie is kind of said we cannot really

1186
00:53:17,229 --> 00:53:19,269
do now but what you can get if you if

1187
00:53:19,269 --> 00:53:21,069
you try to organize your thinking this

1188
00:53:21,069 --> 00:53:22,569
way I'm not I mean you kind of use this

1189
00:53:22,569 --> 00:53:24,819
directly this is just you know concepts

1190
00:53:24,819 --> 00:53:27,459
to use when organizing your analysis but

1191
00:53:27,459 --> 00:53:29,499
if you do this you can actually start

1192
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:31,839
you know saying this suggests that we

1193
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,369
should wait this suggests that we should

1194
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:35,559
act now this suggests it's going to be

1195
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:37,359
super complicated you know so you can

1196
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,239
sort of piece together an argument and

1197
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:41,739
be able to present it to people and say

1198
00:53:41,739 --> 00:53:44,649
you know I I this is what I think we

1199
00:53:44,649 --> 00:53:46,659
should do this is why I think we should

1200
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:48,999
do it this way and I hear you want to do

1201
00:53:48,999 --> 00:53:51,849
it like this but you know based on based

1202
00:53:51,849 --> 00:53:53,679
on what you know I presented to you here

1203
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:55,359
if we do that

1204
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:57,339
that is going to hurt us here so you can

1205
00:53:57,339 --> 00:53:59,949
get a lot more granular discussion

1206
00:53:59,949 --> 00:54:02,380
around the decision on what to do and

1207
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:06,189
that is the whole point of all these

1208
00:54:06,189 --> 00:54:12,519
models so I think I have like four

1209
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:16,119
minutes left is that true yeah so good

1210
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,759
thing I only have four slides left or

1211
00:54:18,759 --> 00:54:20,649
something like that so we're going to go

1212
00:54:20,649 --> 00:54:22,419
to response patterns because now we've

1213
00:54:22,419 --> 00:54:24,489
been talking about the apt patterns

1214
00:54:24,489 --> 00:54:27,249
talking about analytical methods and now

1215
00:54:27,249 --> 00:54:27,959
okay

1216
00:54:27,959 --> 00:54:31,359
we I'm talking about instrument response

1217
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:33,009
let's talk about some incident response

1218
00:54:33,009 --> 00:54:35,130
patterns and this is sort of an

1219
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:39,909
sarcastic slide I'd say that's a very

1220
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:42,369
normal response pattern is just

1221
00:54:42,369 --> 00:54:44,019
ignorance so you can't really call it a

1222
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:45,279
response pattern but you know you just

1223
00:54:45,279 --> 00:54:48,459
ignore the problem completely Sony is I

1224
00:54:48,459 --> 00:54:50,019
don't know if they're ignorant or denial

1225
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:53,229
but like no no it's okay we know we know

1226
00:54:53,229 --> 00:54:56,199
but we accept this risk and yeah well

1227
00:54:56,199 --> 00:55:00,009
turn out that that Cesar was wrong then

1228
00:55:00,009 --> 00:55:01,359
you have denial you know someone tell

1229
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:02,580
you about the problem you just

1230
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:05,520
you just go no I don't I've literally

1231
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,560
had someone tell me that their CTO

1232
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:13,590
quote/unquote didn't believe in a PT so

1233
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:16,340
it was a question of faith apparently

1234
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:20,010
and not then is what I like to

1235
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:21,840
call the maqam old response pattern and

1236
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,850
that is like alert reimage alert to

1237
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:26,490
reimage you know you just

1238
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,740
and then it's the clean purge and score

1239
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:32,610
earth which basically is you know I

1240
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:35,430
don't scope and identify and clean up

1241
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:38,460
that's the clean purge is okay close

1242
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,840
down the network we image everything

1243
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,910
reset every password and scorched earth

1244
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:44,730
is you know build a new data center and

1245
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:46,760
migrate and in the middle there is

1246
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:53,340
engaged and that means playing chess

1247
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,110
with the attackers that means you don't

1248
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:56,850
just Scopes sit back and do nothing

1249
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:59,310
scope and then clean but you start you

1250
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:00,510
know you start poking them a bit you

1251
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:01,740
know I'm gonna I'm gonna close up this

1252
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,840
access I'm gonna make it look like you

1253
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,060
this was just totally random that we did

1254
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:07,800
this but actually we did it to keep you

1255
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:12,930
away from date the source X and the

1256
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:14,670
reason this is an arc the response arc

1257
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:17,100
is that on the left side you know very

1258
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,800
little effect the stuff that you do

1259
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,570
there has very little effect on the

1260
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:23,220
right side you don't really want to do

1261
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,840
that either I mean you do not want to

1262
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,430
build a new data center and migrate that

1263
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:31,620
is insanely costly right and I believe

1264
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,300
that in the middle there you strike a

1265
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,250
good balance between being effective and

1266
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:38,130
being cost effective the problem is that

1267
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:41,550
the engage response pattern requires a

1268
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:44,790
really excellent response team if you

1269
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,710
want to do that if you want to have it

1270
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:47,910
effective but you don't want to build

1271
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:49,530
new data centers from around you know

1272
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:52,140
how we know in them you need to have

1273
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:54,600
really really good people in your

1274
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,580
response team like highly specialized

1275
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,640
team of experts basically which cost a

1276
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,340
lot which is going to you know make a

1277
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,080
lot of companies gonna we can't do that

1278
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,770
but I think that strikes a good balance

1279
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:12,600
and now is for the wrap-up so why did I

1280
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,190
call this the red pill of attacker

1281
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:16,349
eviction well based

1282
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:21,019
these models that I presented I'm gonna

1283
00:57:21,019 --> 00:57:24,210
I'm gonna say that responding to these

1284
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:25,619
kinds of things is actually a lot more

1285
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:28,789
complex than most responders really

1286
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:31,650
realize and appreciate and you're up

1287
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:34,440
against something I chose to were Volant

1288
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,180
because I mean it's easy to think

1289
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:38,009
knowledge you know viruses and computers

1290
00:57:38,009 --> 00:57:39,900
yeah yeah I know the whole adversary

1291
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,180
thing but you know we're cleaning it up

1292
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:43,559
but on the business side of things it's

1293
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:45,059
actually someone coming at you know with

1294
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:47,279
a knife you know they don't play fair

1295
00:57:47,279 --> 00:57:47,759
you know

1296
00:57:47,759 --> 00:57:50,400
they're gonna break every rule in the

1297
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,839
book to win the competition against you

1298
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:57,690
it's like in a soccer field it's like

1299
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:01,979
you know hurting someone's need

1300
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:03,779
deliberately to have them off the field

1301
00:58:03,779 --> 00:58:07,589
right is that kind of thing going on and

1302
00:58:07,589 --> 00:58:09,210
that is the red pill here to sort of

1303
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:11,849
realize how complex it is and how how

1304
00:58:11,849 --> 00:58:16,410
bad it really is but the key takeaway

1305
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,210
from the whole thing is that if you

1306
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,339
really work at understanding what is

1307
00:58:20,339 --> 00:58:23,339
going on to you know use it for instance

1308
00:58:23,339 --> 00:58:25,319
using these models there is a lot we can

1309
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:27,630
do to improve how we do this then you

1310
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:29,969
can actually choose the right response

1311
00:58:29,969 --> 00:58:32,489
pattern to the identified intrusion

1312
00:58:32,489 --> 00:58:35,359
patterns and the trap and risk types and

1313
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:40,440
hopefully land on a better a better

1314
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,119
response plan than you would if you

1315
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:46,680
didn't and I'm gonna end this talk now

1316
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:50,130
with sort of my favorite well actually

1317
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:53,880
it is a prodigy album but it's sort of a

1318
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,609
motto because everyone is going like oh

1319
00:58:56,609 --> 00:58:58,109
the attackers have all the advantages

1320
00:58:58,109 --> 00:58:59,940
and I'm like nope if you use your

1321
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:03,150
home-field advantage you are at a very

1322
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:06,390
good place that's fighting back so even

1323
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:08,999
though you are always outnumbered you

1324
00:59:08,999 --> 00:59:11,999
should never be outgunned and this stack

1325
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:15,509
of models is just one more gun you know

1326
00:59:15,509 --> 00:59:19,859
in your stack to be able to fight back

1327
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:23,700
and I hope at least some of you will be

1328
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,039
able to use this for the good fight and

1329
00:59:26,039 --> 00:59:28,810
now I'm gonna

1330
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:30,580
and not give Mike a heart attack so

1331
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:33,220
thank you for your attention and yeah

1332
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:33,810
thank you

1333
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:35,180
[Applause]
