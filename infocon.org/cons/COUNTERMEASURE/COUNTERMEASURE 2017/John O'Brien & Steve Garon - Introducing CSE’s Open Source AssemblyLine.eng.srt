00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,730
[Music]

2
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,480
so I'll could do a quick introduction

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,560
again my name is Jonah Bryan I'm a

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,029
senior technical advisor within the

5
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:29,210
cyber defense branch it's CSE my

6
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,360
background is in malware analysis

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,489
primarily as a developer I came out of

8
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:36,860
school was you know the one rookie in

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,600
the room and when somebody asked who's

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,830
gonna volunteer to do this reverse

11
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,020
engineering thing looked around no one

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,460
really volunteered so I kind of put my

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,290
hands up and then I spent the next six

14
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,790
years smashing my face against the wall

15
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,470
trying to learn how to do this stuff

16
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,330
back in the day it was actually hard

17
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,710
right now that's pretty cool there's

18
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,659
there's lots of tools so if you're

19
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:54,769
interested we can talk about that

20
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:59,030
offline hi my name is Steve Gao and lead

21
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,220
developer for a semi line you can see

22
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,589
that my slide is in French so if you

23
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:04,819
have any questions in French and English

24
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,650
I can answer those questions in both

25
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,400
language yeah so I've been working with

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,750
John on malware analysis and and to do

27
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,720
Incident Response and then seven years

28
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,450
ago we decided that it was not working

29
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,970
very well so we started to do to develop

30
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,220
assembly line and from then on I've been

31
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,100
working on that project the one thing I

32
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,500
always kind of tell people is that don't

33
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,150
ever hire developers as analysts because

34
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,990
then they just want to do development

35
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,820
and that's kind of what we did and it

36
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,410
seems to have worked for us so and so

37
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,260
we've how do I start this I try to

38
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,610
describe who we are and I never really

39
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,340
do a very good job so I thought I would

40
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,290
start by describing who we aren't it's

41
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,890
just more fun so last couple weeks ago

42
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,500
and we were in CBC which is unheard of

43
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,080
for anything to do with the CSE and and

44
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,940
my ATM at the time made the mistake of

45
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,620
kind of throwing a little bit of sarcasm

46
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,810
into his interview and he used the word

47
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,970
C for super-secret spy agency which

48
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,490
obviously was quoted as the titles so we

49
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,139
are not the super-secret spy agency we

50
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,669
are here in front of you talking my

51
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,830
picture is on the web now we're kind of

52
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,750
out and the other kind of thing that I

53
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,920
like to talk about that it's the first

54
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,409
rule of Fight Club same as the first

55
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:20,060
rule of CC is you don't talk about Fight

56
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,909
Club and you don't talk about CSC we

57
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,709
seem to have failed at that but we're

58
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:26,689
okay with that we're good

59
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:29,380
we're definitely not CSIS and

60
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,390
I wrote this slide and I came back to

61
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,670
her later and I'm like oh that's kind of

62
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,140
really awkward makes this look like

63
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,060
we're kind of digging at CSIS and we're

64
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,410
not like we like CSIS they're great

65
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,540
people but if you're you know making the

66
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,860
choice between going to work for them or

67
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,150
working for us come work for us we're

68
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,570
way better

69
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,920
just totally way better we're and then I

70
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,840
noticed just the other day on Twitter we

71
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,660
get to use Twitter know that our comms

72
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,980
branch is actually kind of stealing our

73
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,870
jokes now so they actually went out and

74
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,670
they commissioned a survey to find out

75
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,290
whether or not Canadians knew who we

76
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,510
were and they don't they don't know who

77
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,890
we are at all they all think receives us

78
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,690
so I'm shouldn't keep repeating this

79
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,780
fact or not CSIS the other amusing thing

80
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,070
about this is that the people that did

81
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,480
know who we were couldn't actually

82
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,250
didn't actually know that it was called

83
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,780
communications security establishment it

84
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,980
seems to be Canadian security

85
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,620
establishment is the the motive the word

86
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,500
of the day so we're gonna keep coming

87
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,030
out here keep talking keep telling

88
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,170
people because I didn't today we

89
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,240
actually do need to hire people and it's

90
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,740
it's tough when they all go to see sis's

91
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,160
website not ours so let's talk about who

92
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,080
we actually are we are the government of

93
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,900
Canada's Leeds cyber security agency

94
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,820
I've taken the text on here is actually

95
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,460
the second part of our mandate and this

96
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,590
is part of the EIT security branch right

97
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,260
so our mandate is to essentially provide

98
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,090
advice guidance and services to help

99
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,470
ensure the protection of electronic

100
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,610
information of information

101
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,930
infrastructures of importance to the

102
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,960
Government of Canada that's a mouthful

103
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,400
in reality what that means is it's JA

104
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,490
it's our job to help protect everyone in

105
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,540
the government as well as think of it as

106
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,190
critical infrastructure right so these

107
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,540
are very legal words and they're hard to

108
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,840
define but we want to help you

109
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,130
the other two minutes that I don't have

110
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,870
listed on there are obviously our

111
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,340
mandate to do foreign intelligence

112
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,440
collection for again Government of

113
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,140
Canada priorities and to help provide

114
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,700
technical assistance to law enforcement

115
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,370
and military operations abroad we're not

116
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,420
going to talk about those because those

117
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,130
get into more you know complicated

118
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,840
issues but we're good at talking about

119
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,370
defence the word we're gonna focus on

120
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,400
that today so this is a quote we found

121
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,630
we were going through because we didn't

122
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,860
really want to have any real words on

123
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,010
the slides this is from 2002 I think

124
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,660
it's Richard Clarke the White House

125
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,540
cyber security adviser it's a pretty

126
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,250
harsh quote right if you spend more

127
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,190
money in coffee

128
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,570
your IT security if you worry about

129
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,400
whether to have you know decaf or I

130
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,230
don't drink coffee so I probably should

131
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,120
be talking about coffee but then you

132
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,090
deserve to be hot right that's arguably

133
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,860
true right if you focus on you know what

134
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,940
kind of breakfast and feed your

135
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,560
employees and you can't patch your

136
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,260
systems well I'd like to feel bad for

137
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,530
you but I kind of don't yesterday I

138
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,540
asked everyone in the room if they all

139
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,010
use two-factor authentication for their

140
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,840
online activities so did anyone actually

141
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,610
go home last night and kind of enable

142
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,980
two-factor authentication anyone pants

143
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,670
anyone No so why not right I gave you

144
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,010
some advice I gave you explain why this

145
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,390
would help you in your online world

146
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,820
people people choose to not take advice

147
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,380
and to not do security right so if the

148
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,090
security practitioners in the room and

149
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,770
the community can't do the bare minimum

150
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,590
right by our own standards how do we

151
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,300
expect departments and businesses and

152
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,250
small and medium large businesses to be

153
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,660
able to do the right thing right this is

154
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,460
this is the struggle that CSC has all

155
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,020
right we're providing advice which we

156
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,300
think is pretty good no one seems to

157
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,020
want to follow it so it's an odd place

158
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,750
to be in the speaker before he talked

159
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,940
about potentially all the bad stuff

160
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,010
that's going on in the world it's it's

161
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,070
pretty rough right we always want to

162
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,630
focus though on the cyber aspect of

163
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,520
things right but it's not that it's

164
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,990
going back to the olden days right

165
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,790
corporate sto espionage

166
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,760
you know theft organized crime right

167
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,560
they just have the internet now right so

168
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,660
if we approach the problem thinking

169
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,520
about the actual core mission of the

170
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,230
people that are attacking us then we can

171
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,790
start to kind of rationalize why they're

172
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,350
doing this and what we can do to

173
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,700
influence them rather than just worrying

174
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,470
about the cyber right everyone likes to

175
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,840
talk about ciphers but we can we can

176
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,690
change the game a little bit so all that

177
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,040
stuff aside let's talk about assembly

178
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,180
line so roughly seven years ago we were

179
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,890
small team myself Steve and one other

180
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,560
person and we had we were doing all of

181
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,330
our analysis for the for essentially for

182
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,150
all of CSC we had a fairly large analyst

183
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,620
team who were pretty good at actually

184
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,120
finding things right so they would find

185
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,950
things they would throw it to us

186
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,110
stas we have here so on a given day we'd

187
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,540
find about 10 bad things five of which

188
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,010
were unique five of which probably

189
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,570
Internet Explorer because back in the

190
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,250
day it was browser helper objects and no

191
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,090
one seemed to be able to tell the

192
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,580
difference between the two so depending

193
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,110
on which one of us was in the bill

194
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,510
was sick you know or whatever we get

195
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,520
between zero and five files done that's

196
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,280
kind of good but really not at the end

197
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,530
of the world

198
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,360
so our kind of mission our mayor you

199
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,530
know vision statement was we wanted to

200
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,660
have consistent analysis and reporting

201
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,430
form our analysts right we're developers

202
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,220
we can solve our own problems so we

203
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,630
started automating right and everyone

204
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,520
who's read didn't use the internet it's

205
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,010
probably seen this this comic before the

206
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,090
idea being that you know you start

207
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,380
writing some code you know takes a

208
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,670
little time you stop doing the real work

209
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,260
and then all sudden the automation kicks

210
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,670
in and then it's just great you can sit

211
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,500
there you know look at cat videos all

212
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,730
day you don't have to do anything

213
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,870
anymore

214
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,640
in reality you write some code it

215
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,110
doesn't work you write some more code it

216
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,580
breaks finally it works but then you

217
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,080
just have this thing this long tail of

218
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,210
development and I'd like to say that we

219
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,740
kind of didn't fall into this trap but

220
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,150
we're still here talking about assembly

221
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,190
line that's okay

222
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,900
the other kind of challenge with this is

223
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,050
that when we built assembly line instead

224
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,520
of actually making our jobs easier we

225
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,110
actually just found more malware all

226
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,230
right so we failed at that so

227
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,510
obviously any good development project

228
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,550
scope creep sets in and again we work

229
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,020
for the government so we are the experts

230
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,660
of scope creep so we took our little

231
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,280
thing and now which is like team of

232
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,850
three people will just gonna just make

233
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,560
some consistent reporting right everyone

234
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,960
will be happy and then we said yeah how

235
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,160
about we just switch that it was like

236
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,630
we're gonna detect and respond to all

237
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,010
malware targeting the Government of

238
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,600
Canada just you know whatever right

239
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,620
we'll just do the Internet so we did and

240
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,870
this happened right ten files to about

241
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,200
10 million files on a given day I'd like

242
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,820
to say that we have a cloud but you know

243
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,679
we don't write so we do both we do what

244
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,169
we can with what we have and we did that

245
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,809
a couple of times and everything lit on

246
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,220
fire and then we did it again and a

247
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,539
little fire again and then we did it

248
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,340
again and it worked so third time's the

249
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:43,789
charm

250
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,690
so assembly line this is very much saved

251
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,880
us when we started doing the development

252
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,250
on this this Verret this edition these

253
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,380
are kind of like the key messages that

254
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,630
we basically needed to fix right so we

255
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,620
knew that we needed to have a

256
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,330
distributed platform we weren't gonna be

257
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,730
able to do this on a single node because

258
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,440
again the Internet is all cat videos we

259
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,090
needed to handle unbalanced workloads

260
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,880
right so a million PDFs today a million

261
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,680
flash files tomorrow whatever all over

262
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,529
the place

263
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:13,019
again since we run our own systems and

264
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,209
everything breaks we had to build a

265
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:16,139
system that would be able to tolerate

266
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,659
and recover from failures and then again

267
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:19,949
it's the Internet we're kind of right

268
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:21,329
we're processing when I say the Internet

269
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:23,189
I'm talking the Internet as what the

270
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:24,479
Government of Canada sees right so

271
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,589
traffic into the Government of Canada

272
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:27,839
people's emails that type of stuff

273
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,389
so that's all very repetitive right the

274
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:32,999
Internet is just cat videos non-stop so

275
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:34,729
we needed very aggressive deduplication

276
00:09:34,729 --> 00:09:37,439
and then again we have analysts and they

277
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:39,239
know where we sit so if we just send

278
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:40,469
them all these alerts or tell them you

279
00:09:40,469 --> 00:09:42,779
things are bad and they're not bad they

280
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,539
will come and find us and they're very

281
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:47,909
persuasive about you know providing good

282
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:50,279
alerts and good good ways to deal with

283
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,649
this mess and then again scalable right

284
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:54,779
like this we assumed we went from 10 to

285
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:56,759
10 million we assumed that we're gonna

286
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,529
go from 10 million further up right so

287
00:09:58,529 --> 00:09:59,609
this system needs to be able to grow

288
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:01,349
past what we expected it to be able to

289
00:10:01,349 --> 00:10:05,159
do so where are we right now on any

290
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,689
given day we essentially will ingest

291
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,459
about 10 million files for triaging

292
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:11,099
purposes after deduplication we can get

293
00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:13,769
that down to about 2 million and then

294
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:15,479
based on those 2 million files we're

295
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:17,939
generating between 3,000 and 150,000

296
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:20,249
dollars that's pretty good on the low

297
00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:22,409
end if we send out 150,000 things there

298
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:27,149
it'll stay they like to find us so one

299
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:28,409
of the challenges that we have with

300
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:29,579
assembly line is actually describing

301
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:31,169
what it is right so I'm gonna try going

302
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:33,689
into 10,000 foot view and hopefully that

303
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:36,059
works for you so if someone gives you a

304
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:37,679
file write your malware guy someone

305
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,599
gives you a file what do you do you take

306
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:40,979
that file you submitted either through

307
00:10:40,979 --> 00:10:44,069
our API or our UI that file is then

308
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:45,329
tasked to a bunch of different services

309
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:47,239
so things just kind of go flying around

310
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:50,129
any any services the process of files

311
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:51,449
that find anything of interesting they

312
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:52,709
can extract something they can send it

313
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:53,970
back up and that kind of keeps going

314
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,529
through the queue everything becomes

315
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,019
related and then each service that's

316
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,119
running service what we call an analytic

317
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:00,689
or plug-in

318
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:02,579
service will to stick with that has

319
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,859
ability to generate a score generate

320
00:11:04,859 --> 00:11:07,169
tags or generate results and I don't

321
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:08,789
think we talk about score very much but

322
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:10,019
if you want to ask that question of how

323
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,519
we generate scores it's it's more or

324
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,849
less a pseudo-random number generator so

325
00:11:14,849 --> 00:11:17,249
you think I'm joking but I'm not know at

326
00:11:17,249 --> 00:11:19,619
all about the analyst right so out

327
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:22,109
malware is bad right this is kind of the

328
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:23,279
kind of the disclosure I want to give

329
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,089
you is that when

330
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:25,709
you did pull the system you're dealing

331
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:28,290
with malware right so you I assumed that

332
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,059
everyone knows what that means but I'll

333
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,860
tell you if you don't segregate the

334
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,959
system where you can you only need to

335
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,420
HTTP HTTPS to get into it SSH for admin

336
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,389
and some of the services will execute

337
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:41,100
them out where if you do a lot of them -

338
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,779
right so you have to assume that the

339
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:45,800
system itself is hostile treated as such

340
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,629
we have the ability to run binaries for

341
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:50,160
within the services we have the ability

342
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,360
to run containers we have the ability to

343
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,910
run VMs so depending on how much or how

344
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,709
little you trust an individual service

345
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:57,629
you have the option of choosing where to

346
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:00,089
put it and then the one last thing I'll

347
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:01,589
say is again because we run these things

348
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:03,329
on our corporate systems any file that's

349
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:04,589
download from the system we actually

350
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:07,790
wrap in this file format called cart and

351
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,589
we used to use a password-protected zips

352
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:12,509
with infected but all the AV people in

353
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:13,680
the room you've ruined that for us now

354
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,589
so we have a new thing we don't talk

355
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:18,149
about that in this in the in the talk

356
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:19,860
today but we can talk about that offline

357
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,199
it's actually pretty cool

358
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,029
so we're how does this actually plug in

359
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:28,019
right so assembly-line secure perimeter

360
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,879
over there don't trust it pretend it's

361
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,670
evil over here right so you have your

362
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,319
analyst you can do all of your manual

363
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:36,059
submissions that's great but

364
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,079
realistically you're gonna want to plug

365
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:38,519
this into something right so we call

366
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,959
this data sources because I don't want I

367
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,189
don't know what your data sources are

368
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:44,339
and if you have you know a network

369
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,679
collection or you can have you have AVS

370
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,389
anything that can give you a file we

371
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:50,069
consider that a source if you want to

372
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,329
plug this directly into your mail server

373
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:52,829
and just have it act as a mail transfer

374
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:54,569
agent we don't offer that as a service

375
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:56,459
but you can build it pretty easily on

376
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,620
the other end which I didn't draw is

377
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,959
kind of what happens after right so for

378
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,569
us we actually take alerts from this

379
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:05,459
system we use that to feed into our kind

380
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,259
of dynamic defense systems that we use

381
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:08,819
to protect the Government of Canada so

382
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:10,589
we're actually blocking things in real

383
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:14,040
time we're racing people to the click so

384
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,610
core components of the system there's

385
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,870
actually way more lines that should be

386
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,040
on this graph but it becomes really

387
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,329
confusing so we just took half of them

388
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:24,959
off so don't treat this as gospel the UI

389
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,519
API essentially will throw things down

390
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,290
to middleman middleman essentially our

391
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,110
ingestion processing it's job is to to

392
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,519
throw things away we don't want to

393
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,720
process things if we've seen them before

394
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,040
we don't want to process things if

395
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,209
they're there wirelessly we don't

396
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:38,189
process things if there's any reason you

397
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:38,550
can

398
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,140
middleman --the one that sets the

399
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,150
priority once it's decided that you know

400
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,620
you actually will scan this it'll throw

401
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,670
it into the dispatching layer

402
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,980
dispatching layers job is basically to

403
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,510
make sure that things complete right so

404
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,980
it's gonna fire it up to service a a b c

405
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,200
and what order whatever order you've

406
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,440
specified and its job is to either

407
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,670
complete them or make sure they fail

408
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,780
enough times that you don't really care

409
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,910
right we assume things are gonna fail so

410
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,240
we've designed for that we've got Redis

411
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,100
and rock as our kind of queuing and

412
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,320
storage layers I won't go into much of

413
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,520
that but if you are interested in

414
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,380
distributed computing we can talk

415
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,760
offline after it's actually really cool

416
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,650
we went from being like malware people

417
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,120
to like distributed engineers and it's

418
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,730
like it's actually really fun so enough

419
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,320
talk we're gonna let Steve take on the

420
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,360
demo stuff all right

421
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,070
so John was talking about the the

422
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,500
internals of the system and how we're

423
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,940
structured so I'm going to jump in to

424
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,340
our dashboard where it actually gives

425
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,320
you the health of our system that's the

426
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,760
demo machine of course like there's a

427
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,650
red card because we have no ingestion

428
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,960
right now going on so at the top here

429
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,660
it's the middleman so the ingestion goes

430
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,060
through all through this guy it

431
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,370
prioritized the file in critical high

432
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,280
medium low Q's and then it will feed the

433
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,530
files through the system at a given pace

434
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,950
so we don't overload the system and if

435
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,990
we if we get overloaded that doesn't

436
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,880
matter if we send 10 million files to

437
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,680
this and we can't process them and fall

438
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,840
behind we'll start dropping files on the

439
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,310
floor and just sample the files that we

440
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,400
scan and then here you got the

441
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,230
dispatcher dispatchers is possible to

442
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,970
send to all the services so it will

443
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,590
actually look at the file type do file

444
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,180
class analysis on the type and I route

445
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,300
it to the proper services for analysis

446
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,160
so if we have a PDF it will only go to

447
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,370
services that can process PDFs and at

448
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,630
the bottom you have each of the

449
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,040
different services that you run right

450
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,290
now in your cluster you can see for each

451
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,160
services you have the number of workers

452
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,000
on per provisions and the number of

453
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,310
workers that are actually worrying what

454
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,910
that means is we can actually have a lot

455
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,100
of worker provision and then we could do

456
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,410
distributed computing for the for those

457
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,720
workers and there's also the number of

458
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,550
profiles referencing

459
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,850
the service that means that right now

460
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,980
sat.1 so that means there's only one box

461
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,900
that can process that service so ideally

462
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,300
you'd want have multiple profiles that

463
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,910
can run a given service so if one box go

464
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,130
down you're okay you can still process

465
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,520
files it will just be slower I'm talking

466
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,100
about provisioning and profiles to

467
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,570
actually provision your cluster it's

468
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,070
actually really easy you have a

469
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,590
provisioning page where it shows you the

470
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,820
number of courses you have in your

471
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,560
cluster and the amount of RAM that you

472
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,270
have in your cluster and then you can

473
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,640
just pick the slider and say okay for

474
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,890
the service I want you allocate as much

475
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:29,700
of this like 12 apk for example and it

476
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,020
will tell you how many cores you need

477
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,910
for it and RAM it'll tell you if you're

478
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,850
over provision or not so so you can

479
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,860
slide any other services and get your

480
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,900
provision running and then you go at the

481
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,280
bottom and you just say test

482
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,900
provisioning plan and we try to

483
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,180
distribute those services accordingly

484
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,590
and all the boxes that we have in the

485
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,900
cluster and then we'll apply those

486
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,530
profiles to those different boxes there

487
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,650
was also a flex node parameter those

488
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,960
nodes instead of actually provisioning

489
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,700
them and actually applying a profile

490
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,890
that they'll have to run this set of

491
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,459
predefined services it will actually not

492
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,010
run anything and just look at the queues

493
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,780
of the different services and the one

494
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,160
that's the busiest it will pick that

495
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,260
queue launch as much services for this

496
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,079
for this as much instance of this

497
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,599
services and then try to get rid of that

498
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,910
queue to get rid of the bottleneck so in

499
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,980
one when your system is unbalanced

500
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,480
that's like the one way that we found

501
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,450
that we're just gonna change the rules

502
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,950
of the systems we can actually process

503
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,710
those home balance workload and then

504
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,880
when you're done when you've probably

505
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,730
only a cluster you could just hit the

506
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,160
host page where you have the list of all

507
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,200
the hosts on your cluster and you can

508
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,550
just say okay you pick the nodes you

509
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,020
want to restart and then you just click

510
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,610
the restart button and it will load the

511
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,380
new profile and it'll be provision as

512
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,680
you asked for it right enough about the

513
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,200
infrastructure let's actually submit

514
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,350
faster system so if I go to submit page

515
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,060
this is basically the landing page for

516
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,550
assembly-line you get there you can

517
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,550
submit files to the system I'll get your

518
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,440
attention to the sidebar here

519
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,660
it's where you can actually configure

520
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,940
your scam so if you look at this you can

521
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,340
cook your priority so if you have

522
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,750
something that needs to get done now you

523
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,370
need to jump in front of everyone you

524
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,050
could set a priority higher and then

525
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,790
you'll get your file right away level

526
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,740
you'll jump in front of everyone in the

527
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,420
queues of the service and in the queues

528
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,630
of the submissions of your user system

529
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:27,120
and then you have a time to live this

530
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,180
system is not at TKB we cannot store all

531
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,700
the data forever and that's not the

532
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,590
point it's really just an in/out system

533
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,620
we put a file in and then we scan it

534
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,500
give you a result and then just take it

535
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,180
out if you want to keep it and put it in

536
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,970
a KB if you want but we can't right now

537
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,800
keep all the files because of the load

538
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,290
that we get on the server for the for

539
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,410
the hash index and everything and then

540
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,230
you have service specific parameters you

541
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,410
can influence how the service will scan

542
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:01,470
a file so for example we were talking

543
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,590
about password-protected zips before

544
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,760
let's say you put a really weird

545
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,800
password on your file you can actually

546
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,230
just type in the password here and then

547
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,980
when we send the desert to the

548
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,720
extracting service it will actually use

549
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,300
that password to extract the file so

550
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,130
these are parameters you can send to the

551
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,400
services to change their behavior and

552
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,200
then the last but not least you have the

553
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,420
service selection so each service are

554
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,210
categorized by category and then you

555
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,100
have an extraction service networking

556
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,950
service that I can analysis service

557
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,930
dynamic analysis service and then you

558
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,060
can pick and choose the actual category

559
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,500
or pick and choose the individual

560
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,350
service and then you just put your file

561
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,360
in then you scan right now I'll select

562
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:52,500
all and then and then put a file in then

563
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:59,250
just hit scan so follow scanning you see

564
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,960
the results coming back five and then

565
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,670
it's actually done so I scan the file in

566
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:09,660
four seconds from 9 to 13 so obviously

567
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,430
that's not the speed that you're going

568
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,220
to get what we do in the backend we do a

569
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,850
really high level caching so if

570
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,470
because I've submitted that file so many

571
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,330
times to the system it knows exactly

572
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,010
what the results are so it's just

573
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,510
serving you the same results over and

574
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,299
over service results are deterministic

575
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,900
so if you have the same hash with the

576
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,940
same service version it will feed you

577
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,929
the same results when you view the

578
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:38,940
submission detail you have your all you

579
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,289
use selection that you did at the

580
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:42,990
beginning on that slide panel so I put a

581
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,840
password in for that zip it didn't use

582
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,130
that one because that's it was not

583
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,049
encrypted but yeah so you have a

584
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,419
password and you have the selection how

585
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:52,980
many days I wanna I want to have this

586
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,580
file for all that stuff there's a

587
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,380
metadata section here I don't have any

588
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,630
metadata for that submission but if you

589
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,390
were submitting the file through a

590
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,059
really high volume in gesture you could

591
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:07,620
put metadata so you can actually trace

592
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,370
back that file to a given source or a

593
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,120
protocol or whatever and then there's an

594
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,090
executed summary while we're scanning

595
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,039
those files we're extracting features

596
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,010
which we call tags and then these tags

597
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,549
have a type and value for example you

598
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:28,950
have domain names you have URI you have

599
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,030
a virus name so any any any tag that we

600
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,760
extract well some of them will actually

601
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,799
promote them to an executive summary so

602
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,230
analysts are able to make a good

603
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,880
decision on which files they shouldn't

604
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,220
they need to pursue so for example if I

605
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,650
click on a Dooku sample here I have an

606
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,659
implant name which is Dooku and then you

607
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,850
see it I lights the file in my zip

608
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,130
that's actually related to this so I can

609
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,020
actually drill down to those things and

610
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,580
if I click on any other thing it will

611
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,280
just highlight something else

612
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,650
so let's actually pursue this so let's

613
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,860
click on Dooku click on the file you

614
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,549
actually have the specifics of the file

615
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:11,700
so the hash is the SS deep hash the size

616
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,659
the type that we've determined and then

617
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:17,970
you have the frequency so the frequency

618
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,799
is when we seen at first when we've seen

619
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,840
it last how many times we've seen this

620
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,179
and then you have a submission summary

621
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:25,530
so we were taking parts of the

622
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,850
submission and try to get statistics

623
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,419
about this so here it's how many which

624
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:30,930
users

625
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:34,230
Milutin how many times it's been 12

626
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:37,230
times and then the exhaustive list of

627
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,910
generated tags all the features that

628
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,980
we've extracted they're all presented to

629
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,810
you at the top as you can see I've

630
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,280
clicked on Dooku on the previous page

631
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,990
and it's still eye lighted so I can

632
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,640
actually follow through and see okay who

633
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,920
did that who actually tell it told me it

634
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,110
was Dooku so if I scroll down you can

635
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,090
see oh it's the yarra rule that we have

636
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,160
for Dooku samples that's the rule

637
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,530
description and then you see here the

638
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,480
tags that we've generated because of

639
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,290
that rule so it's all good but what else

640
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,760
do I have on Dooku so if I actually

641
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,100
clicked a little search but I decide to

642
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,440
Dooku tag I could search the system for

643
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,070
other instances of Dooku everything that

644
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,610
we have in our database is fully indexed

645
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:23,040
so you can search on anything we use

646
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,540
solar as a back-end to do two searches

647
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,950
so that's kind of why we can't keep all

648
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,380
the data it's really hard for the system

649
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,700
when you have millions of files coming

650
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,060
in and you have to index all the files

651
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,500
so I can actually just remove I don't

652
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,210
want to search for only tags I can

653
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,370
actually search just for any instances

654
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,920
of Dooku so you can see I have results I

655
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,580
have signatures and I have alerts so if

656
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,990
you want to know what that signature

657
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:52,230
that I that I used to actually find a do

658
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,700
Kemal where you could actually click on

659
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,850
it and then you have the detail of that

660
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,980
signature here in the system so you get

661
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,520
the full detail here and we can even

662
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,280
edit those signature on the fly you can

663
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,860
click the Edit signature we built our

664
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,230
kind of own standard to actually

665
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,960
classified malware properly in our

666
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,560
system so for this test that signature

667
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,770
is a signature of group implant so it

668
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,840
actually detects implant and then the

669
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,030
name of it will be Dooku too so if

670
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,260
actually hits on something it will

671
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,110
actually tag this malware it's Dooku and

672
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,260
we have our old standard defined here in

673
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,510
a malware standard or if you go to help

674
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:36,540
you can see the yarra malware standard

675
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,820
so if you're interested on see how which

676
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,250
are the metadata fields that we've added

677
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,080
to the stand to the yarra signatures

678
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,980
actually

679
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,049
do all that classification and automatic

680
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:52,650
scoring okay last week when we're at a

681
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,510
hackfest there was a presentation about

682
00:24:54,510 --> 00:25:00,990
apks and it actually gave me a really

683
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,640
good idea to actually show you the power

684
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,450
of assembly line so I'm gonna submit an

685
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:11,400
apk malware and I'm gonna actually tell

686
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,750
the apk service to resubmit the the Dex

687
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,620
file as a jar so if I do this and I scan

688
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:27,840
it you can see here I get the apk I

689
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,470
click on it I can view all the generated

690
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,179
tags so we've extracted all the features

691
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:35,820
for this thing so we can actually do our

692
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,429
classification better and then you go

693
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:40,740
down in a system see go through the

694
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,010
service that actually generated all

695
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:46,919
those tags you'll see all the the things

696
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:49,140
that we have to report on it but then a

697
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,960
deep at the end you'll actually see ok

698
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,610
we've extracted a file so the service

699
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:56,010
created a new file and then resubmitted

700
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,600
it to the system it went through the

701
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,760
whole process and then this new file was

702
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,640
processed by the system if I click on

703
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,040
that file so that's that's now a jar

704
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,080
file so I took the decks of the Android

705
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,330
malware and then created a jar out of it

706
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,340
and now I'm processing that jar and now

707
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,960
we have another service which is called

708
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,900
espresso that does jar file analysis if

709
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,570
I click on this one you'll see that I

710
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,309
have supplementary files these are files

711
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:25,200
that are not resent to system for

712
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,510
analysis but I could help me to do my

713
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,760
malware analysis at the end if you go to

714
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,980
the bottom there's an audio recorder of

715
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,500
Java if I actually view those dis file

716
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,570
in the file viewer and then here you

717
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,450
have the source code for the implant

718
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,580
that's already you've been processed and

719
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,580
we've extracted it we've compiled it and

720
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,220
brought it back as a source file so

721
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,540
that's the kind of thing that we try to

722
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,940
do so we can extract files from one

723
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,340
binary tune and then we submit a system

724
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,540
and feed it to another sort of

725
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,640
and actually get more data out of that

726
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:06,420
that that service so that's all good for

727
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,520
one file when with a single submission

728
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,560
but we've said that we were processing

729
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,250
ten millions of files per day so how do

730
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:17,820
we actually go through all that data so

731
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,550
we have an alert viewer where we

732
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:24,480
generate alert system such data is too

733
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:35,280
old all right so we have an alert viewer

734
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,440
where we can view all the alerts for the

735
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,160
system these alerts will be classified

736
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,710
in in reverse order so the newest alerts

737
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,050
will show up on top so the analysts

738
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,700
instead of actually just going through

739
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,530
every single submissions in the system

740
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,790
they can actually just go to the other

741
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,040
view and see okay whatever we scored

742
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,770
high and we think is malicious until you

743
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:59,480
they can go through that data there

744
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,270
their group by md5 well by hash so you

745
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,850
can actually see campaigns like if you

746
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,590
have a one sample that was sent

747
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,660
hundred thousand times you'll see one

748
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,960
alert for that the 400,000 alerts one

749
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,540
one card for that alert and then you can

750
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,630
actually process those in batch you'll

751
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,770
see all the details that we've extracted

752
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:23,160
about this the this alert and then we

753
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,500
can actually categorize that alert okay

754
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,420
is that something that's malicious here

755
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,860
we have something that we know it's

756
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,230
malicious what's the priority of it and

757
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,030
then you can apply label so you can

758
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,790
actually do a search query in solar and

759
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,190
say okay if anything matches this kind

760
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,590
of file name with this reg axe I can say

761
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,810
okay it's camping X and then classify it

762
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:47,040
and treat it as a bulk and then you can

763
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,600
actually take ownership of an alert if I

764
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,100
click on this one and say ok I want to

765
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,330
take ownership of that alert I don't

766
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,950
want anyone else to process it I just

767
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,810
take ownership and then done everyone

768
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:58,100
else will see ok I'm processing this one

769
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,480
applying those labels and those campaign

770
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,340
is really tedious if you try to actually

771
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,900
go through and do it by hand

772
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,910
but what you can do is you can actually

773
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,210
apply filters so if you go to a workflow

774
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,110
filter you can predefined

775
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:14,170
anything any search query and then a

776
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,240
plot and have a consequences about that

777
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,820
that defined search so if I say okay if

778
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,640
I find any size that's bigger than one

779
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,429
mag and I'll I'll label it X large and

780
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,500
then all the alerts will now get an X

781
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,840
large if they're bigger than one mag in

782
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,580
the alert viewer and that will be done

783
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,809
automatically before they actually

784
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:36,340
display to the user and one more thing

785
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:41,650
in the alert viewer you can actually

786
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,200
drill down by properties so you can do

787
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,360
statistics on the properties and say

788
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,929
okay out of these samples I've

789
00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:52,270
attributed all these ones and seven of

790
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:55,900
them are attributed to a TP 28 I got the

791
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,900
seven ghost five Dooku and stuff like

792
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,460
that so you can actually say okay like

793
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,380
I'm interested in AP 228 I'll click on

794
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,570
this and these are the seven samples for

795
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:12,130
AP 228 on that time range alright so the

796
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,440
other things I wanted to talk about here

797
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,440
is the malware heuristics so basically

798
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,299
we're extracting those features we have

799
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:21,640
a ton of checks that we're doing we

800
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,320
don't want people to redo those checks

801
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,540
and if they add new services I don't we

802
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,190
don't want people to actually redo all

803
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,110
the checks that we've built so we've

804
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,480
actually categorized all those checks

805
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:36,610
into your wrists examen an apk if

806
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,960
there's a duplicate permission

807
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,020
definition so there's a heuristic for

808
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,419
this so this is one of the checks that

809
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:46,390
we do in our system so we'll check if a

810
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,610
permission is asked twice in the

811
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,429
manifest and if that's the case that's

812
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:53,410
not something that a normal developer

813
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,870
would do so we flag it but that we've

814
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,700
actually were actually categorizing

815
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,010
those checks so people know what we're

816
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,360
looking for so they don't have to

817
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,770
rewrite the same things that do you

818
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:08,980
write new plugins and last but not least

819
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:13,510
api's everything that I did in the UI

820
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:16,600
for this presentation could all be done

821
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,450
through an API call everything's API

822
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,360
base we we want automation as much as

823
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,419
possible you don't have to

824
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,220
use Rui if you don't like it you could

825
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,350
just send a file in and get the results

826
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,059
out and do something else in another

827
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:33,539
interface so everything you can do you

828
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,100
can do it through the API so we have a

829
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,859
whole API documentation here you can

830
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:40,230
just click on whatever API call and

831
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,080
you'll get all the details on how to use

832
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:49,799
it and everything alright as I was

833
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:53,100
saying if you don't use our UI you need

834
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,989
to automated stuff so and John was

835
00:31:54,989 --> 00:31:56,850
talking about this we do automatic

836
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:02,700
defense on our data via API so it's

837
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,489
super simple we package it with we

838
00:32:05,489 --> 00:32:08,039
package our software with a client a

839
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,259
Python client so you could just install

840
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:13,080
the client run any Python interpreter

841
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,739
and then just import it login with your

842
00:32:16,739 --> 00:32:19,769
username password and then submit a file

843
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:21,929
in and get get the full results you get

844
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:25,440
a JSON blob so it's really simple we've

845
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,759
built the client to be as simple as

846
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:31,039
possible so anyone can use it

847
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:35,519
and next basically writing a service is

848
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,460
also extremely simple you can write any

849
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,070
service that do an external API call

850
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,710
that runs a binary or that actually are

851
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,149
just in Python and you can actually

852
00:32:45,149 --> 00:32:47,580
detect the file in Python but the idea

853
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,769
is that you have one class that you need

854
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:51,929
to overload and in one method

855
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:54,899
it's the execute method and then you'll

856
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:56,879
get a request and that request will

857
00:32:56,879 --> 00:33:00,269
contain a hash and you'll with that hash

858
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,519
you can actually go get the binary or

859
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:04,639
query another source with the hash or

860
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:07,440
you and you'll get all the tasking as

861
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,029
well saying all the different parameters

862
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,619
is just the service is sent to you so

863
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:13,369
the the system is sent to your service

864
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:15,840
and then you can go from there and you

865
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,879
can actually also see all the tags that

866
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:19,859
the previous services I've generated for

867
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:22,409
this file so you can actually build a

868
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:25,649
post service that will actually create

869
00:33:25,649 --> 00:33:27,480
results base of the results of other

870
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,730
services that's how we do the chaining

871
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,989
and that's that's why I like the

872
00:33:30,989 --> 00:33:32,730
distributed computing is really pays off

873
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,279
well thank you I'll leave it back to

874
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,130
John ok so a lot

875
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,390
you're probably asking why are we here

876
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,010
right we're CSEE we're super-secret

877
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,480
spies why are we actually talking in

878
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,830
public you know we're all developers

879
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,270
were all introverts it's not because we

880
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,050
like public speaking

881
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:50,190
I'll be honest with you not at all be

882
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,260
honest it's been impairing for quite a

883
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,790
few years that we can't solve this

884
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,410
problem ourselves right so much do we

885
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,580
love government to just solve everything

886
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,840
for us it's not really gonna happen

887
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,340
right we've all kind of have been

888
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,840
suffering in silence we're not really

889
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,970
very good at working with each other so

890
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,500
we're trying something different and

891
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,460
we're trying to come out and talk to

892
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,540
people that are in this community

893
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,580
because again there's a lot of experts

894
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,750
in this community that don't work for

895
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,340
government we're not the best at hiring

896
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:15,149
everybody and to be on a stainless pitch

897
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:17,219
we are actually recruiting so you know I

898
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,449
would literally hire everyone in this

899
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:21,629
room I can my HR people would probably

900
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:23,940
get annoyed with me but that doesn't

901
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,230
necessarily solve the problem right I

902
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,820
take all the good security professionals

903
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,260
here and now there's no one else in the

904
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,060
community right so we need to figure out

905
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,710
a better way to get more people into

906
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,870
this field and what better way than to

907
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,699
actually tell people what our problems

908
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,639
are so one of the questions we get a lot

909
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,469
is why open source and the answer I

910
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:43,530
asked is why not right there's a better

911
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,600
answer in that for me to go and partner

912
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,190
with every single company in this room

913
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,850
every single province government

914
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:52,260
involves lots of NDA's lots of lawyers

915
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,270
nobody really likes it no-one has fun

916
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:57,660
and so this is our kind of giving back

917
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,180
to the community we as you can saw in

918
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,820
the talk we use open source extensively

919
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,860
for everything within assembly line as

920
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,960
well of a lot of other projects within

921
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,190
and within the organization we kind of

922
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,320
had a little bit of an internal argument

923
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,330
about how how much the open source right

924
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,580
so in this case you'll see we're

925
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,780
primarily we're open sourcing the

926
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,330
framework we do have some services that

927
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,670
have been released and we haven't

928
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,870
released everything that's one of the

929
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,150
questions we get because again there's

930
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,980
an arms race that always happens cat and

931
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,170
mouse game and I would argue right now

932
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,460
the mice are winning so the other reason

933
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,300
and this is again quote from Scott Jones

934
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,830
as much fun as it is building automation

935
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,870
and you know distributed queuing systems

936
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,280
and all that stuff at the end of the day

937
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,130
like I am a malware analyst most of you

938
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,420
are probably in this field as well

939
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,370
I'd really like you to just actually do

940
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,480
your jobs and do

941
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,050
our stuff right it's hard I get it but

942
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,700
if we can get people to start focusing

943
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,960
on the things that actually really

944
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,780
matter is how to detect a bad file I

945
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,050
think we'll get a lot better off there

946
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:06,359
are a bunch of tools that have been

947
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:07,770
released within the last six months to a

948
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,440
year so they kind of scooped us on this

949
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,390
but we'd like to put another one into

950
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,040
the into the community and see which one

951
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,220
wins

952
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:19,260
it's another quote Steve pulled off the

953
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,300
internet there it really it's talking

954
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,830
about this idea that we can't really

955
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,300
keep stuff to ourselves anymore

956
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,369
right so I have a really cool detection

957
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:27,660
analytic you have the exact same

958
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,060
analytic what we're wasting our time

959
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,060
right one of the one of the stories I

960
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,619
like to tell is working with a colleague

961
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:36,900
in the UK we both found this really cool

962
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,660
sample years ago and then we both spent

963
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,369
about a month reversing it right we

964
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:42,780
didn't talk to each other because until

965
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,040
we actually know what it is we did it

966
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,720
tend to not share that team seems to be

967
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,460
the default within the community and

968
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,470
then you know the month month finished

969
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,180
up we both wrote a report and send the

970
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,530
report across and it was literally a

971
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,180
duplicate of each other right so that's

972
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,830
a month wasted of you know people that

973
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:58,320
are really intelligent doing this work

974
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,850
right rather than just sharing things

975
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,490
early share often all right so that's

976
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,340
kind of my pitch to you you know if you

977
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,200
get compromised it's it's okay it

978
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,420
happens to the best of us it's a lot

979
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,670
better to talk about it and and they fix

980
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,380
it early than it is the weight and you

981
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,880
know kind of publish a report and it

982
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,230
doesn't really work so when we released

983
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,580
one of the things we kind of made of

984
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,990
made a mistake on is that we didn't

985
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,060
really use the right word right so we

986
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,500
said we really sing something on to the

987
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,260
public right and for any of you who've

988
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,630
even remotely involved in intelligence

989
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,960
agencies and you know public relations

990
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,480
we have a little bit of work to do the

991
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,280
very first thing that kind of came out

992
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,540
this you know one of the comments was

993
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,040
well I'm not gonna I'm not gonna install

994
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,780
this ceases spoken malware on my machine

995
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,700
which is cool because it's we're not

996
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,590
CSIS and you know you can stall the CC

997
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:49,020
malware on your machine it's not malware

998
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,410
really it's not people seem to be really

999
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,510
confused that you know we wanted you to

1000
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,950
go take this home and install this on

1001
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,690
your desktop and use this either a B and

1002
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,369
then send all the files to us that's

1003
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:01,470
that's not what we're asking to do right

1004
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,330
this was meant to be released to the

1005
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,369
public community

1006
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:05,749
primarily people in the security

1007
00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:08,479
community so governments large small

1008
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:11,839
medium businesses certs research labs

1009
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,089
academia info sack if you're a single

1010
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:15,859
person working on home in a VM cool yeah

1011
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:17,089
you can do it if you know what you're

1012
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:19,039
doing but honestly we're looking at

1013
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:20,569
people that are have more established

1014
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:23,869
programs in this case we would like to

1015
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:25,849
get more people in this community that

1016
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:27,380
actually understand what's going on so

1017
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,849
if you're in academia and you want to

1018
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:30,859

1019
00:38:30,859 --> 00:38:32,539
you're in corporate by all means we'd

1020
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:34,369
love to talk to companies we we can't

1021
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:36,170
protect everybody so we're not gonna try

1022
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:37,430
we're just gonna let you help you

1023
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,440
protect yourselves

1024
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,799
so some links to the projects one of the

1025
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:44,420
questions we also get is why pit bucket

1026
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,999
why not right we have a github repo we

1027
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:48,950
have a bitbucket repo we're good with

1028
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:52,009
both we have assembly line separate from

1029
00:38:52,009 --> 00:38:53,210
carts so you can take a look at both

1030
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,890
carts actually quite small really easy

1031
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:58,819
to read we have bilingual readme is on

1032
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:00,890
everything from the Canada Translation

1033
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:03,950
okay as well we have a Google Group for

1034
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,569
doing all of our interactions with the

1035
00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:06,979
community so if you are interested pop

1036
00:39:06,979 --> 00:39:08,779
in ask some questions

1037
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,420
most of the kind of the craziness around

1038
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,400
the release is kind of died down so we

1039
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,539
can actually have like civilized

1040
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:17,869
conversations now that's pretty much all

1041
00:39:17,869 --> 00:39:20,029
we have and I'd like to thank everyone

1042
00:39:20,029 --> 00:39:21,880
for coming

1043
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,360
