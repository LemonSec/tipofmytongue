00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,630
the crime where ecosystem analyzing

5
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,430
understanding it a little bit of

6
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,350
everything I do want to point out that

7
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,029
you know this is just not my work alone

8
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:34,280
I'm back stopped by it seemed a really

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,170
good guys back home actually all over

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,699
the world they're sort of everywhere

00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:39,949
scattered geographically remote but Kent

12
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:44,540
Backman Ahmed Sohn ball Raja Saab some

13
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,280
of these guys have been writing some of

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,540
the publications I'm gonna be talking

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,909
about referencing and all the things are

16
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:51,170
linked in the slides too so go check

17
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,379
them out these guys do really great work

18
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:55,760
additionally really well back stop by

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,979
the community right cybersecurity is a

20
00:00:57,979 --> 00:01:00,530
as a tight-knit bunch of folks whether

21
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,120
it's guys you know you're connecting

22
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,400
with on Twitter or you know Intel

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,080
sharing groups like the are exchange and

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,870
others just really supportive and I

25
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,040
couldn't do any of this and way I don't

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,180
think we collectively could do this

27
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,770
without the support of each other it

28
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,380
takes a village right alright let's get

29
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,000
into this Wow those words look really

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,280
big from down here crime war ecosystem

31
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,320
right and you know you can read these

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,090
this sentence for two and I mean really

33
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,340
all this is to say is that you know this

34
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,820
is not as you know not my president said

35
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,210
a 400-pound 400-pound guy on his base on

36
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,470
the basement couch of his mom's house

37
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,010
right the crime where actors today are

38
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,680
100 percent sophisticated for the most

39
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,970
part you know I mean there's still the

40
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,530
occasional you know skit or two they get

41
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,480
rolled up by you know you're a pole on a

42
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,670
routine basis but for the most part the

43
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,490
campaign's that we're all seeing are

44
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,890
sophisticated market force driven actor

45
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,440
groups that are really applying lessons

46
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,659
learned and best practices from industry

47
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:01,850
so they're scooping up lessons learned

48
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,360
from from Verizon you know how they set

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,250
up customer service right and we'll talk

50
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,840
about that with stuff like server I mean

51
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,158
crazy right customer service for

52
00:02:10,158 --> 00:02:11,959
ransomware who'd have thought but these

53
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,970
guys are mature they're sophisticated

54
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,830
they're hard to catch and they're

55
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,440
getting paid at all of our expense right

56
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,300
so something to think about and that's a

57
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,620
theme I'd like to sort of weave through

58
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,389
the talk about trends today oh hey now

59
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:27,390
there we go

60
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,680
that's a theme I'd sort of like to weave

61
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,330
through the talk today's sort of show

62
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,650
how these guys are responding to

63
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,200
business forces how they're implementing

64
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,510
you know new innovation and you know

65
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,490
return on investment and different

66
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,280
technologies it's really eyeballing if

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,390
you think about it or mind boggling

68
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,950
rather so the exchanges let's start with

69
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,080
basics right I think we're all vaguely

70
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,640
aware that hey there are forms and

71
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,690
exchanges all over the world

72
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,240
regionalized heavily right you know

73
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,760
places like Russia definitely the the

74
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,230
leading exchange where they've got you

75
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,720
know sort of down to a tee complimentary

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,090
goods and services and an assembly line

77
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,010
fashion you know module modularly

78
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,020
creating you know and crafting crimeware

79
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,550
campaigns to go hit our networks of

80
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,260
ourselves and our customers and our

81
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,739
constituents us right if you guys in the

82
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,540
US should be more North America US and

83
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,209
Canada right but if you guys are in some

84
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:19,709
of these same forms as me I mean I think

85
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:21,120
you probably know that you know more

86
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,040
than half the guys in there are probably

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,680
FBI age answer you know some agents of

88
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,930
some states so it's sort of a really

89
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,390
interesting mix and lots of interesting

90
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,860
conversation in some of these forums

91
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,850
right Brazil China Japan Germany all

92
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,860
regionally localized and specialized

93
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,959
sort of outfits right specializing in

94
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,580
different flavors of crime where a lot

95
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,910
of times West Africa fraudsters stuff is

96
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,530
definitely on the rise in West Africa

97
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,420
there's some dispute as to who the real

98
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,840
Nigerians are quote-unquote I'm gonna

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,000
think that they're equally as likely to

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,690
be Romanian as they are Nigerian but but

101
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,760
that's neither here nor there right but

102
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,290
what's happening on these exchanges is

103
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,940
you know it's providing a marketplace

104
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,680
for any key exchanges as good and

105
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,140
services you know compromise creds for

106
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,200
sale traffic and delivery you know spam

107
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,910
bots hey I want to go deliver spam

108
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,440
messages to you know a couple hundred

109
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,220
thousand folks and deliver this payload

110
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,380
hacking services right I need recon

111
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,209
I need bug hunting I need vulnerability

112
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,150
development malware dev ransomware

113
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,710
services you know people want to pay for

114
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,479
a new payload to be specially crafted

115
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,070
for them and their campaign that they're

116
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,620
coming up with and infrastructure right

117
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,740
BOTS hosting all sorts of things like

118
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,360
this and this is pretty routinely

119
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,820
happening right under the noses of all

120
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,889
law enforcement folks and honestly

121
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,150
there's not a whole lot that we can do

122
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,460
about it in this fashion because I mean

123
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,900
these guys are really good at sniffing

124
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,599
out you know the the Fed if you will I

125
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:50,279
didn't remember back in the day at black

126
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:53,819
con Def Con you just bought the Fed yeah

127
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:56,009
a couple people thank God man nowadays

128
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:57,990
it's popped the hacker because there

129
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,520
aren't any hackers there it's all

130
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,400
security folks in facts right role

131
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,009
reversal

132
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:06,719
all right so the services the things

133
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:07,949
that we're seeing out there routinely

134
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:09,810
and this should be no surprise to some

135
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,389
of you guys it's kind of basic right you

136
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:14,939
know as far as traffic goes compromise

137
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,879
sites right malvert izing spam providers

138
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,319
traffic distribution systems etc etc

139
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:24,569
delivery services whoops sorry about

140
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:27,840
that round button delivery services

141
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,270
ex-boy kids drive-by download droppers

142
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,889
clickbait and we'll talk a lot about

143
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:33,629
some of these and specifically moving

144
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:34,889
forward here

145
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:37,319
hacking services you know some DDoS

146
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,210
capabilities as Brian Krebs about that

147
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,330
how that went for him right credential

148
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,740
harvesting and that's going to be

149
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,240
credential harvesting is a huge theme

150
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,069
that we've seen this year and we'll talk

151
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:48,479
specifically about some of the campaigns

152
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,029
that have been leveraging that recon bug

153
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:52,349
hunting all the things that are

154
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:54,240
necessary evils to keeping the business

155
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,300
machine rolling here right now we're in

156
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,500
payloads think about these is your

157
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,180
service I'm sorry as your product

158
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,189
development teams your R&D teams right

159
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:04,919
you know we at RSA might be building a

160
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:06,870
new net witness build but these guys are

161
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,399
building new ransomware builds info

162
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,169
stealers you know creating new miners

163
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,839
right stuff like that rats for the more

164
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,580
advanced campaigns right dropping a

165
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,110
backdoor on there so somebody can get in

166
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,069
and have their way with your network

167
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:19,080
your data maybe talk to Equifax

168
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,409
exploit development huge right that's Rd

169
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:24,659
that's the new stuff coming up and all

170
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:25,969
the infrastructure like we mentioned

171
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:29,520
shab domains bulletproof hosting botnets

172
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,050
definitely botnets so how does it all

173
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,069
work together right this is just a very

174
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:40,199
simplistic diagram that uh that I came

175
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,029
up with in my marketing people improved

176
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:44,819
upon quote unquote I'll say but

177
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,919
essentially you know traffic crosses

178
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,919
infrastructure a delivery of an exploit

179
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,110
is made and then payloads or hacking

180
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,580
happens and then cache

181
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:02,620
money new BOTS hey seriously it was

182
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:09,870
Slovak you guys got anything back there

183
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,599
yep nothing's happening

184
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,530
sup

185
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:34,840
good times so there was this one time

186
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,110
where no I don't have a story too cute

187
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:46,450
up for this unfortunately this is

188
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,520
totally part of the show and I've

189
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,200
prepared an interpretive dance number

190
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,410
right now so let's go ahead and get this

191
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,750
show go in here no this is totally not

192
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,090
like kevin has no talent because that

193
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,210
will become apparent very quickly but

194
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,710
you know as we as we figure this out

195
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,410
this issue here I mean it's really

196
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,420
really very important to sort of respect

197
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,240
the competence of these crimeware actors

198
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,280
right I mean these guys are making

199
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,190
millions upon millions of dollars at our

200
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,680
expense and often in a pretty

201
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,170
humiliating fashion for us I mean to be

202
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,880
completely honest let's talk about

203
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,250
Equifax for a second right does anybody

204
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,110
know what the what the passwords were of

205
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,970
the external web servers on Equifax that

206
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:33,909
were hacked the creds admin admin I kid

207
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:37,390
you nots admin admin rights I

208
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,370
mean honestly this is the credit bureau

209
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,140
charged with protecting safeguarding a

210
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,809
hundred plus million folks security

211
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:45,100
credentials their their financial

212
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,770
information here we go cool admin admin

213
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,010
right IT hygiene should be basics to us

214
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,900
at this point right that's more than 50%

215
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,700
of the problem space and maybe more like

216
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,590
75% of it if we don't have good IT

217
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,020
hygiene in our networks our customer

218
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,490
networks our constituents networks

219
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,280
everything we do is worthless right and

220
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,630
that's something that you know you can't

221
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,120
foot stomp enough but you know how do

222
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,770
you how do you you know how do you

223
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,450
ensure good patch configuration

224
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,060
practices with a customer that you know

225
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,220
is underwater and in some other capacity

226
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,100
under fire from management by a you know

227
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,780
for some other topic or subject matter

228
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,790
right it's really hard to get through to

229
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,140
some of these guys occasionally their

230
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,150
priorities are not always our priorities

231
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,580
in cybersecurity which is unfortunate

232
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,840
right you would hope that they rely on

233
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,750
us to provide the expertise there but

234
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,730
here we go right working again I'm not

235
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,730
going to touch that blank button I swear

236
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,320
how it works together right all these

237
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,000
things sort of map to these pillars like

238
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,220
we're talking about but let's take

239
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,630
look at it from a criminals point of

240
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,440
view right traffic comes in right

241
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,210
legitimate traffic hurt it into

242
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,370
designated bottlenecks this could be you

243
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,750
know this could be malvert izing were

244
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,910
first rings this could be a compromised

245
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,390
site this could be a TDS hits

246
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,970
infrastructure crosses that botnet right

247
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,100
or crosses that shadow domain to that

248
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,100
landing page exploit gets delivered

249
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:11,590
these guys are watching exploit gets

250
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,950
delivered as the exploit gets delivered

251
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,960
you know it's typically customized right

252
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,060
based on your user agent string in a lot

253
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,160
of cases I mean this is not you know

254
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,750
that 400-pound guy in the basement on

255
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,220
his mom's couch right these are guys

256
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,040
that know what they're doing as that

257
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,410
exploit gets delivered payloads happen a

258
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,060
rack gets dropped so they can hack

259
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,100
against these guys bad stuff landing on

260
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,500
that victim machine what does that

261
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,170
return to them sustainability cash money

262
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,840
credentials more bots for their botnets

263
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,330
etc etc it's a simplistic cycle and

264
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,920
forgive me for those of you that love

265
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,310
the no kill chain I'm not a huge fan of

266
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,020
it I think something more simple

267
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,580
explains the problem space a little bit

268
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,290
better occasionally especially when

269
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,550
you're throwing abstract terms around

270
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,230
like you know how the ecosystem maps to

271
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,800
it now let's take a look at the customer

272
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,110
side of this or in this case the victim

273
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,820
side my grandma hypothetically right

274
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,800
grandma's email address harvested or

275
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,270
purchased maybe from a list server a

276
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,510
spam service right grandma at hotmail

277
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,740
calm a friendly botnet delivers spam

278
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,200
message to my grandma maybe target may

279
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,510
be opportunistic who knows she's got

280
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:26,830
mail Oh pictures of my grandkids in this

281
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,810
case her great grandkids right because

282
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,520
I've got three and she sees them all the

283
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,350
time and she can't get enough she's

284
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,030
licking their cheeks and stuff all the

285
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,580
times creepy you know grandma all

286
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,390
pictures click what is grandma just done

287
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:44,350
I think you all know grandma suddenly

288
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,480
has her machine locked up and Kevin at

289
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,030
9:30 p.m. on a Saturday hypothetically

290
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,880
gets a phone call Kevin

291
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,820
shooters not working we're God

292
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,580
hypothetically right so what does Kevin

293
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:05,600
do Kevin likes the screen well played

294
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,210
well played screen gods

295
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,130
what does Kevin do Kevin drives over to

296
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,710
Grandma's retirement home and pays the

297
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,330
Hat it pays the actors don't lock you

298
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,640
right wrong Kevin just on three images

299
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,190
her machine we're not paying those bozos

300
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,260
so broke the cycle in this case but you

301
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,770
guys get the idea right there's two two

302
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,290
distinct vantage points all these crime

303
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,240
work campaigns you know the victim side

304
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,190
and then the actor side just important

305
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,340
to keep that in perspective right all

306
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,070
right now let's start talking about some

307
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,410
trends and why are trends important

308
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,330
right there's a lot of folks out there

309
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,790
that would say you know trends you

310
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,160
normalize and normalize patterns I don't

311
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,360
really tell me that much about where

312
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,730
these super advanced guys are going I

313
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,460
would argue that the trends that we see

314
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,620
in security datasets and flows and

315
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,480
patterns of behavior from these actor

316
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,080
groups directly provide indication to

317
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,520
how these guys are gonna be hitting a

318
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,020
lot of our networks our customer

319
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,210
networks in our constituents may not be

320
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,060
100% true for you know shell crew or for

321
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,150
you know apt 28 but for the bulk of the

322
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,320
attacks that we're seeing on our

323
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,430
networks and the bulk of the attacks

324
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,200
that we can actually mitigate and defend

325
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,190
against trends are absolutely important

326
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,710
this case ultimate anonymity services

327
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:25,340
anybody familiar with them you guys got

328
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,630
to get in some of the same forms as me

329
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,910
man these guys came on the online about

330
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,820
a month ago peddling a couple hundred

331
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,370
thousand RDP connections right full

332
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,740
creds ready to go right why is that

333
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,780
important well first off take a look at

334
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,320
how businesslike their opening email is

335
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,970
before using our service we strongly

336
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,380
recommend that you familiarize yourself

337
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,780
with our rules and pricing I mean this

338
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,130
sounds like you're reading like the EULA

339
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,690
from like you know a Verizon app or

340
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,600
something on your phone right so these

341
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,360
guys you know come out have this strong

342
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,580
showing strong sales pitch we want to

343
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,830
sell some RDP creds why does it matter

344
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,650
right why should I care about this well

345
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,680
hey these creds are worldwide and

346
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,270
I want to give a shout out to Vitaly

347
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,100
from flash point who let me steal this

348
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,080
steal couple graphics from him they did

349
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,520
put out a report about two weeks ago on

350
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,110
this definitely worth checking out and

351
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,960
you got a reference on the bottom there

352
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,220
these credits are worldwide right

353
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,690
sometimes regionally but you know

354
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,160
they're available almost everywhere

355
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,630
depending where the flavor of month is

356
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,500
for your targets if I look at the US wow

357
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,360
these are really localized so maybe

358
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,190
understanding this trend if I'm a guy

359
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,870
operating out of Franklin County Ohio

360
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,450
one of those big red heatmap bubbles

361
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,050
right there

362
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,000
maybe I'm starting to think about like

363
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,730
hey how's our RDP go I know we locked

364
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,560
down with our DP do we have default

365
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,570
passes like do we need our DP open on

366
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,160
all these external facing servers and

367
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,410
then if I see this the cost of an RDP

368
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,660
cred for one of these IP addresses it's

369
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,060
under ten bucks

370
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,890
holy I'm getting scared right

371
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,240
especially if I'm in one of those red

372
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,899
circles I'm thinking man our DP creds

373
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:04,730
available right down the street for me

374
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,190
for three bucks a machine that's nuts

375
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,470
right I mean this gives you an idea of

376
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,470
the availability of compromised

377
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,880
credentials they had a really really

378
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:20,600
inexpensive level all right trend number

379
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,720
one when I really talk about decline of

380
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,670
exploit kits so last year fall winter

381
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,220
even early spring this year exploit gets

382
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,529
rained right anybody else follow all the

383
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:35,589
e I test pseudo dark leach campaigns

384
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:38,060
seamless campaigns watched all those

385
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,700
guys I mean essentially just I mean

386
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,839
compromised site after compromised site

387
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,580
after compromised site just delivering a

388
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,529
ton of nasty stuff well so he ran

389
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,060
somewhere that was probably the biggest

390
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,310
payload we saw from these guys some info

391
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,130
stealers but mostly ransomware well we

392
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,180
were lucky enough to team up with

393
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,120
GoDaddy in the spring and conduct a

394
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,920
major takedown we named it shadow fall

395
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,390
right a little bit cheesy but you know

396
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,650
there was a marketing person in the room

397
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,529
so I had to happen right and no offense

398
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,910
to any marketing people I love you guys

399
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,560
for what you do it's just we don't

400
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,899
always connect at the right levels you

401
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,100
know it's like cynic huh

402
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,779
what anyways GoDaddy and ourselves

403
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:16,490
managed to take down 40,000 plus

404
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,670
actively resolving shadow domains in May

405
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,520
of this year

406
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,529
so that's 40,000 resolved to an IP

407
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:25,020
address actually back ended and hosted

408
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,480
shadow domains right these shadow

409
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,339
domains were primarily set up the

410
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,589
programmatic access to the GoDaddy DNS

411
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:34,620
API and in dramatic fashion right

412
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,510
five hundred thousand fifteen hundred at

413
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,000
a time created set up his landing pages

414
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,100
for an exploit kit and then unplug two

415
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,200
days later as they got stale right and

416
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,570
oftentimes the the customers that were

417
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,270
compromised none the wiser had no idea

418
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,490
right GoDaddy had no idea until we

419
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,870
alerted them about this and we dug into

420
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,240
it together identified probably five or

421
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,529
six different patterns different

422
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:57,600
programmatic patterns for you know how

423
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,890
they accessed and set up these shadow

424
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,060
domains and then had the naming

425
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,740
conventions behind them well when we

426
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,660
unplugged them all it was a pretty good

427
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,699
feeling right

428
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:06,420
forty-thousand plush out of the maze

429
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,119
unplug one day to the next and I know it

430
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,429
worked because a we got some choice

431
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:13,230
comments from some of the rig landing

432
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,270
pages that were still functional which

433
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,250
was always good a little bit of respect

434
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,220
a lot of hatred I would say as well a

435
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,660
lot of money on the line there for these

436
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,119
guys right so we like to think that

437
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,679
helped contribute a little bit to the

438
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,970
decline of exploit kits right it's

439
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,250
definitely not the only thing and I

440
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,390
would recommend that folks that are

441
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,610
interested in this go take a look at

442
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,960
Jerome Segura from eyewear bytes has a

443
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,490
good report out from the summer as well

444
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,490
as Brad Duncan from pal toes unit 42

445
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,540
detailing all the reasons why we think

446
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,100
exploit kids have declined over the

447
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,590
summer right and that's still the case

448
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,900
right now so what's the impact the

449
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,500
impact

450
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,230
malvert izing mal spam pick up as the

451
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,260
main traffic and delivery vectors 100%

452
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,050
the case who is work mouth spam this

453
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,940
summer has someone not working I'll

454
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,170
spend the summer hell thank you one

455
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,330
person worked it oh thank you thank

456
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,710
you power right that's the fun little

457
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,790
graphic over there you can take a look

458
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,990
at that's just Twitter mentions which

459
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,480
honestly I think is a very very good

460
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,910
source of Intel so if you have if you're

461
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,110
not on Twitter and you work in security

462
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,240
you should get on Twitter the bad guys

463
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,559
are on there just as much as us so what

464
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,780
is this market forces at work we took

465
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,550
down a whole bunch of stuff we took down

466
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,780
a lot of their infrastructure and shadow

467
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,480
domains and suddenly the amount of

468
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,800
activity we're seeing mentioned on

469
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,230
Twitter declines maybe coincidental

470
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,700
I don't think so need to do a bunch of

471
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,519
other open source researchers

472
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,989
well that's one trend right so how did

473
00:18:36,989 --> 00:18:38,369
that work though let's map that back to

474
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:40,249
that ecosystem we're talking about right

475
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:43,200
traffic comes in malvert as income for

476
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,570
my sites tds is the main flow of traffic

477
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,749
the exploit gets traditionally right

478
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:50,609
hits domain shadows or bulletproof

479
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:53,129
hosting that shady backend ASN everyone

480
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:54,629
calls our tea calm I shouldn't have said

481
00:18:54,629 --> 00:18:56,190
that probably but you guys know what I'm

482
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:56,669
talking about

483
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,529
right and all the bgp peering agreements

484
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:02,399
to go with our tea com exploit kit lands

485
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:03,779
a vulnerability right or lands an

486
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:05,549
exploit and again this is tailor-made

487
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:07,710
stuff this is custom stuff based on your

488
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,279
user agent string in many cases as they

489
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:13,559
drop that Ram it ransomware and this is

490
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,419
you know common to to what we saw with

491
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:18,269
rig over the late spring definitely

492
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:20,580
ramit ransomware cryptocurrency miners

493
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,830
cathodic banking Trojan all sorts of

494
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,799
nasty stuff lands on that victim device

495
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,289
cash money credentials right

496
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:28,830
sustainability that's what it's all

497
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,940
about for these guys right they've got

498
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,499
to keep that sustainability up and

499
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:33,509
running if they don't they're dead in

500
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:35,779
the water

501
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:39,149
so after rigged and exploit gets

502
00:19:39,149 --> 00:19:39,840
declined

503
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,210
we saw the summer of mouse ban as we

504
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,820
like to quote it right and we're not

505
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,619
alone in this I mean some real great

506
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,600
Intel and some real gate information

507
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,389
sharing from folks like James in the box

508
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:53,039
Vitalik Ramez these are guys I work with

509
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,570
me routinely on Twitter against mouse

510
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,309
spam campaigns if you don't follow them

511
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:57,960
I would if you're interested in

512
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,820
concerned about Mouse spam this little

513
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,649
graphic over here is from the month of

514
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:03,330
September just all the campaigns the

515
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,239
James saw with the number of targets the

516
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:08,549
date time groups what the delivery

517
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:09,869
vehicle was if it was a linker and

518
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:12,359
attachments and and there's a ton of

519
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,700
information out there like this on the

520
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,799
left side you got links to all the

521
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,629
different campaigns that we as RSA first

522
00:20:18,629 --> 00:20:20,429
watch pushed reports on that we

523
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,470
published on right and these are

524
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,330
everything from the very most

525
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,639
opportunistic give a viral

526
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:29,429
campaigns to more targeted verticals

527
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,259
banking Trojans for instance going

528
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:33,869
against a lot of Western industry banks

529
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:36,779
on financial sectors and over to the

530
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:38,669
right a little bit more targeted stuff

531
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:40,859
some of that stuff was direct apt

532
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:42,989
nation-state activity leveraging you

533
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:44,609
know very well-crafted mouse man

534
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:46,590
campaigns my favorite up there is

535
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,450
probably the Dimity campaign

536
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,750
we're apt 28 rue 8 we're going back and

537
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,410
forth trading some choice words apt 28

538
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,170
delivered a mouse spam document with EPS

539
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,160
exploit in it

540
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,220
turu 8 rue 8 wrapped up the same

541
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,670
document the same EPS exploit with some

542
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:08,070
choice comments inside of it and send it

543
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,380
straight back to them there were some

544
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,260
words like Kaspersky in there and

545
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,280
I'm quoting that I don't mean to offend

546
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,340
anyone and also some choice lyrics by

547
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,500
Slipknot from the song snuff if any of

548
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,060
you know this song you'll realize that

549
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,920
this was a very pointed message to these

550
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,900
guys so some real interesting

551
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,850
back-and-forth here with between apt

552
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:30,030
nation-state actors as well as some of

553
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,290
them you know the monsoons and the moon

554
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,300
winds and some of the more second-tier

555
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:38,130
nation-state guys so how does that look

556
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,570
with our ecosystem right let's took you

557
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,390
back there right mal spam one of the big

558
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,040
things that we saw the summer was locky

559
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,220
oh my gosh locky was everywhere I was so

560
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,560
damn sick of locky anyone else sick of

561
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,820
lucky yes yes alright so mal spam

562
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,480
malvert izing right deliver traffic

563
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,580
across botnets bulletproof posting

564
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,350
should be clickbait up there not

565
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,660
drive-by download it's my bad

566
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,270
delivers ransomware locky server

567
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,500
although server fell off a little bit

568
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,360
this summer last fall server was much

569
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,250
much more prevalent I was just as sick

570
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,020
as Server last last fall as I am of

571
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,740
lucky this year in fact is my grandma's

572
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:22,110
machine Cash Money creds and the messed

573
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,030
up thing here is I mentioned that

574
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,430
customer service aspect right best

575
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,170
practices from business being applied to

576
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:32,310
trim to crimeware campaigns server spent

577
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,500
time and effort contracting a call

578
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,470
center I kid you not a 1-800 number call

579
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,720
center to walk people like my grandma

580
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,030
through the payment process to decrypt

581
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,530
their machine and you know what's even

582
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,660
better they got like five star ranking

583
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,730
ratings like everyone loved them

584
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,100
everyone loved them I said I'm kid you

585
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,720
not I there probably Yelp reviews go

586
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,750
look just crazy right I mean it's the

587
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,370
small things that make a difference

588
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,200
right if you can invest in customer

589
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,000
service I don't care what business you

590
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,340
are legit or

591
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,039
right and increase your revenue income

592
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:06,769
by 10-15 percent why the hell not and

593
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:09,610
that's what they've done

594
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:13,070
ransomware remains a reliable revenue

595
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,019
stream right and that's something that

596
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,820
we need to think about right these guys

597
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,129
are smart enough to incremental eyes and

598
00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:21,379
diversify their revenue streams that is

599
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:22,999
a lesson straight out of the PlayBook of

600
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:24,830
any business that's successful right

601
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,659
ransomware is money they know they can

602
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:32,919
count on and they're counting on it so

603
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:34,999
just a note here and I got some little

604
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:37,009
blue notes just to swap people in the

605
00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:38,749
back of the head occasionally if you're

606
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:40,490
being targeted by ransomware if Mouse

607
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,499
spam is a problem there's some very

608
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:44,600
logical things you can do employ Demark

609
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,169
people domain message authentication and

610
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:50,960
reporting controls I think open source

611
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,730
project right it's basically a way of

612
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,960
understanding and establishing

613
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,999
reputation and domains so that you're

614
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:58,340
not accepting mail from shady domains

615
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,889
another very basic thing if a domain is

616
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:03,409
brand new if it's 24 or 48 hours old

617
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:06,259
please don't take email from them no

618
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:07,909
legitimate business is gonna start

619
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:10,549
blasting email to you within 48 hours of

620
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,710
standing up a new domain just not gonna

621
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,210
happen if it does you can blame me all

622
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:20,029
right another trend bulletproof hosting

623
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:22,999
right so the destabilization of Ukraine

624
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:25,070
is a great example of this right you

625
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:28,100
know 2014 2015 pro-russian separatists

626
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,830
you know decided that they wanted to

627
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,179
rise up in eastern Ukraine and Crimea

628
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,830
there weren't any helicopters dropping

629
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,779
them there were no trucks or artillery

630
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:37,340
pieces rolling in just you know

631
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,720
hypothetically these guys just decided

632
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,480
to rise up right well regardless of how

633
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,059
that happened the net effect has been a

634
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:46,159
destabilizing factor within eastern

635
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,350
Ukraine right anytime a region is

636
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,059
destabilized you know law and order goes

637
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:52,360
to hell in a handbasket right and so

638
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,559
anyone that's worked mouse man this

639
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,820
summer anyone that's worked ransomware

640
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,559
this summer or the last last year and a

641
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:01,009
half actually has probably seen a lot of

642
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:03,549
domain registration stuff straight to

643
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:07,340
Donetsk Ukraine Luhansk Ukraine all

644
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,549
sorts of spots right here in our

645
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:12,740
friendly trouble area where pro-russian

646
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,690
separatists are clashing with Ukrainian

647
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:15,260
authorities

648
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,750
right and it's really pretty brilliant

649
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,340
if you think about it

650
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,080
you know law and order goes to hell in a

651
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,000
handbasket you have an opportunity of

652
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,520
I'm a citizen in you know East Southeast

653
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,200
Ukraine here I need to make a buck or

654
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,660
two hey maybe I should just spin up some

655
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,250
VPS and host a whole bunch of crime

656
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,660
where I mean who's gonna come knockin

657
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,120
like Interpol you're a pole hell no

658
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,470
they're not going into this warzone

659
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,419
right so if you need to make some money

660
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:40,910
it's a good idea a little bit shadier

661
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,160
and more devious idea though and a

662
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,740
hypothesis of mine is that you know

663
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,660
nothing much happens under Vladimir

664
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,870
Putin's nose especially in a place where

665
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,540
his troops and his SVR FSB a guys are

666
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,840
deployed wouldn't it be a great idea to

667
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,910
destabilize a region and help pay for

668
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,429
your campaign by hosting crime where

669
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:03,049
services and bulletproof hosting there

670
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:05,179
and taking a cut of the crime where

671
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:08,240
revenue stream seems pretty good right

672
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,860
seems like a pretty good idea I think

673
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,480
I'm gonna try that in Denver see how it

674
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,160
goes probably not very well yeah so hey

675
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,410
they're not enforcing any laws let's

676
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,120
host some crime we're here great idea

677
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,040
everybody it's happening an interesting

678
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,020
thing is as we can see continued

679
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,059
destabilization other regions look for

680
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:31,040
Moldova next I wouldn't be surprised if

681
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,410
we see the same trend happening

682
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,669
bulletproof hosting providers popping up

683
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:37,010
their backends for ransomware backends

684
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:40,730
for crime work campaigns all right

685
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,130
another big trend and this should be a

686
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,770
no-brainer for a lot of you guys I hope

687
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,940
credential and infrastructure harvesting

688
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,770
has been huge this year the last six

689
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,799
months spent off the charts right this

690
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:53,500
aspect it's a nice little graph here

691
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,360
just of September brute force SSH

692
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,169
attacks no surprise another key offender

693
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:02,270
hoops key offender

694
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,600
Chinese asns all littered throughout the

695
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,780
top top offenders here but honestly it

696
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,760
makes you wonder if there was a shortage

697
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,890
of compromised credentials to host

698
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,809
things like exploit Kate landing pages

699
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:17,809
shadow domains etc what would your next

700
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:20,270
step be probably to continue ramp up

701
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,250
your exploitation and if initiatives to

702
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,200
harvest infrastructure harvest

703
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,450
credentials write scarcity of goods

704
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,340
implies that we should go after those

705
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:28,850
because the

706
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,130
prices right and that's what's happening

707
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,710
here and this has been a trend that's

708
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,720
been on the upward arc for years now

709
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,910
right anyone that's in network events

710
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,710
new consistently see scanning

711
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,600
consistently sees fuzzing consistently

712
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,610
sees brute-force attempts RDP ports and

713
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,920
SSH ports but the really scary thing

714
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,670
here is that in my experience most guys

715
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,680
on the network defense size have become

716
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,660
desensitized to this they just don't

717
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,640
care anymore right oh it's just scanning

718
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,380
leave alone man oh it's just some

719
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,580
brute-force stuff leave it alone

720
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,080
we're good we got to factor we're

721
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,670
alright man no big deal right

722
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:04,220
and honestly these are indications of

723
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,950
attacks potentially yes much of is just

724
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,360
opportunistic scanning looking for

725
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,460
default creds or a port open with

726
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,170
password one two three four right stuff

727
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,960
like that but in many cases this is your

728
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,670
first indication that somebody's coming

729
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:19,130
after you right so we have to figure out

730
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,490
a way to understand the importance and

731
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,680
the significance of scanning brute-force

732
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,360
attacks in our networks they could have

733
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,920
increased demand for scarce goods I

734
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,010
don't know you guys be the judge and

735
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,530
honestly people why the is port 22

736
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:41,060
open seriously 3389 why is that open

737
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,300
like one of our lab guys the other day

738
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,500
and i'm not gonna mention his name cuz

739
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,570
it's embarrassing you know set up a new

740
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:50,030
VPN for us right and on the VPN client

741
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,040
machine he had port 22 open externally

742
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,650
like within three days we saw like this

743
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,110
huge spike in traffic coming to our box

744
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,000
and luckily we caught it in time but

745
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,250
just a very simple miss configuration it

746
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,350
shows you that anyone is susceptible to

747
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,240
this so we always have to be vigilant

748
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,760
watching for the basics this is basic IT

749
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,280
hygiene if you don't need SSH open

750
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,080
externally don't open it externally

751
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,530
please

752
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,900
all right credential harvesting back

753
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,640
there right and remember mal spam is our

754
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,950
big delivery vector right big traffic

755
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:25,400
vector trick bot and hand sitter I am so

756
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,800
tired of trick bot enhancer this summer

757
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,870
trick bot has been the the banking

758
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:33,230
Trojan flavor of the entire summer and

759
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,030
trick bot is actually pretty elegant

760
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,680
malware if you take a look at it I'm

761
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,380
gonna use this process injection and has

762
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,120
a bunch of encrypted content that goes

763
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,179
with its

764
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:45,799
pretty cool as far as malware goes I

765
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:48,710
didn't do anything right hey

766
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:53,759
who but trick bot you know is something

767
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,399
that it's it's looking for creds right

768
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,929
it's looking for it to steal information

769
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,929
from your from its victims in many cases

770
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:03,210
banking creds but it's not picky it's

771
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,919
gonna take whatever I can get and there

772
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:06,119
are a lot of different file extensions

773
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,980
it goes after Bitcoin wallets for

774
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,350
instance right you know speaking of that

775
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,850
well I got a funny story but I'll

776
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:12,690
mention it a little bit later we're

777
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:25,940
gonna talk about cryptocurrency no no no

778
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:30,600
all right so delivery vector right trick

779
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,720
BOTS Hansen her classic info stealers

780
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,249
you know and banking Trojans it hasn't

781
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:36,889
been just trick bots it's been Retief

782
00:30:36,889 --> 00:30:39,840
it's been dry decks a little bit of

783
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,269
resurgence dry decks again recently it's

784
00:30:42,269 --> 00:30:43,799
been core bot is back and he remembers

785
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:45,779
core BOTS these are all things the

786
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,029
actors are dusting off updating and

787
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:50,159
going after creds right in a heavy and

788
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,009
fast way which makes me think they need

789
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:56,460
creds right maybe it's partly due to

790
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,559
some of the the rigged exploit takedown

791
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,539
maybe it's partly due to you know them

792
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:02,100
just exhausting their supply and this is

793
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,710
the natural cycle of things in any case

794
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,019
it's indicative of demand in their

795
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:10,080
marketplaces right all right thank you

796
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,110
I'm gonna buy you guys a beer later and

797
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,199
roofie it

798
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,810
sorry I was joking totally joking all

799
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:22,660
right now spam delivers delivers via

800
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,750
botnets and bulletproof posting RT con

801
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,490
remember those guys cheese

802
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,660
cesspool worse than OVH honestly

803
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,850
clickbait we click on it suddenly trick

804
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,650
bot banking Trojan Hansen her info

805
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:38,860
stealer grabbing all your creds breaking

806
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,240
your machine no I'm not really breaking

807
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,180
it in this case but you get the idea

808
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,350
credentials that's what they're after

809
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,940
that's the number one seller right now

810
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,660
today credentials hey thanks for the

811
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,840
bank account info dude I love it man

812
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,580
what can you do about this right there's

813
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,820
some very basic obvious things for

814
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,060
instance oh yeah yeah that thing again

815
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:04,810
for instance weird I'm downloading a PNG

816
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,730
file and it's really an executable

817
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,950
I mean honestly folks if you're

818
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,960
downloading something and it's not an

819
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,510
exe extension type and it ends up being

820
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,550
executable you should immediately be

821
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,590
looking at this right I hope we all are

822
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:22,270
on the same page here all right so

823
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,590
what's happening with all these creds

824
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,910
what are they doing all this stuff right

825
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,310
I mean are they just spinning up

826
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,260
spinning up video games on them and

827
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,850
doing craziness

828
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:33,520
not really bots one of the biggest

829
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,170
things we're seeing right and this is

830
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,700
not new I mean we should all should be

831
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,500
aware of botnets and you know understand

832
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,600
the threat that botnets pose necker's

833
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,910
number one long term botnet lots of

834
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,470
different device types personal

835
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,650
computers pcs other devices etc

836
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,940
responsible for tons of Mouse spam

837
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,510
campaigns locky trick bots etc for it

838
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,950
for years now that thing has been

839
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,900
lurking in the in the backdrop and just

840
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,580
you know delivering campaigns at will

841
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,850
essentially what's a little scarier or

842
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,980
some of the IOT botnets right the me

843
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,080
Ryan pure açaí botnets from last summer

844
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,700
you know taking advantage of default

845
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,090
credentials on IOT devices building into

846
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,070
millions of numbers of BOTS and these

847
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,020
guys largely believed to be responsible

848
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,370
for the Dyne outage on the East Coast

849
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,620
last summer as a show of power show of

850
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,200
force just to prove hey we can leverage

851
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,760
this and weaponize this botnets

852
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,040
they did right Twitter was down I was

853
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,129
like

854
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,850
Reaper Reaper is a newer one right I

855
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,500
like to think this is a little bit more

856
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,830
sophisticated sort of botnet than than

857
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,570
Murai only in the fact that because

858
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,250
they're leveraging actual

859
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,620
vulnerabilities they're leveraging

860
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,049
exploit DB public vulnerabilities to

861
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:46,830
roll through Linksys Netgear d-link IP

862
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:49,590
cameras etc etc and attack them right

863
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,990
with with a stock easy one-line

864
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,880
vulnerabilities to grab credentials grab

865
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,399
passwords get command line access into

866
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,169
these devices right I know this because

867
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,669
we've seen their attacks in our

868
00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:00,990
infrastructure we've seen them in our

869
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,940
sinkhole infrastructure we published a

870
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,409
good article about a week and a half two

871
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,600
weeks ago that rolls through the CDs and

872
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,129
shows you the request and response

873
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,899
headers for these various attacks check

874
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:12,389
it out what's scary about these guys is

875
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,819
we don't know who owns them I don't know

876
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,560
who's in control these guys if somebody

877
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,239
does please grab me afterwards I'd love

878
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,099
to get some details on that but what's

879
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,389
really frightening is what are their

880
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:23,429
purposes what are their intentions what

881
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,649
are their motivations right is it about

882
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:27,629
cash money is it about making a

883
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:29,460
political statements what happens when

884
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,960
these botnets get turned against

885
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,480
critical infrastructure right it's a

886
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,719
scary thought honestly how are they

887
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,849
being weaponized right and I mean we

888
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:40,349
talked about mouse man malvert izing

889
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:41,489
hacking services these are all more

890
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:43,710
traditional things operational relay

891
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,980
botnets right if bad actors nation state

892
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,030
guys are controlling some of these

893
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:50,069
botnets they're damn sure using them to

894
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:51,810
obfuscate their activities right and

895
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:54,480
operational relay bonnets are real thing

896
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,149
and if I ot Reaper is being used for

897
00:34:57,149 --> 00:34:59,130
that none of us might be the wiser that

898
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,050
our camera is being used to you know

899
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,510
attack DND networks for instance right

900
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,240
and if we were able to figure out if D&D

901
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,290
was able to figure that out and I'm

902
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,730
pointed you John they were able to

903
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,099
figure that out then it would be back to

904
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:13,349
Mike my IP camera and that's it the

905
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:15,119
trail goes cold after there right so

906
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,550
very very dangerous capabilities in the

907
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:24,240
wrong hands the DDoS threat right and

908
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,339
this is no joke I mentioned dying right

909
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:28,619
Dee duster this is a these are some

910
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:30,390
graphs from Ann Arbor networks reports

911
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:34,470
based on 2013 through 2016 DDoS stats I

912
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,359
think if you look in the top left there

913
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:38,010
you'll see the the number one target of

914
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,060
course is the US because

915
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,460
for douchebags for the most part because

916
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,960
of our president probably for the second

917
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,660
part the fifth targets Canada though

918
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,980
right so you guys should be concerned

919
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,640
about that

920
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,230
and what's even more disconcerting is

921
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,010
look to the right there

922
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:58,050
if you look to the right there yes yes

923
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:01,360
to the right there right look at 2013

924
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,520
2014 2015 right

925
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,040
relatively modest bar charts right maybe

926
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,940
this doesn't make a whole lot of sense

927
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,860
if you can't see it all the way the

928
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,610
green the green is over 100 gigabits per

929
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:15,790
second attacks DDoS attacks the red is

930
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:18,420
over 200 gigabit per second attacks

931
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,130
those attacks in particular have more

932
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:25,090
than quadrupled from 2015 to 2016 that

933
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:27,370
means somebody's able to pour 200

934
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:29,590
gigabits per second of traffic onto a

935
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,570
single IP address or series of IP

936
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:34,950
addresses and that's the scary thing

937
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:38,050
that's the scary thing right is it is

938
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,940
impossible to separate you know an

939
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,220
actual DDoS threat from DDoS extortion

940
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,020
this email right here on the bottom is

941
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,580
you know one that we saw on our networks

942
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,950
for phantom Squad ooh scary

943
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,660
phantom Squad sort of like a you know

944
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,340
cheesy knockoff on lose anyone from

945
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,120
pants wet in here

946
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,950
alright coolness says this is cheesy

947
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,320
knockoff of lizard squad right a bunch

948
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,470
of gamers that you know took down

949
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,760
hypothetically supposedly purportedly

950
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,500
took down you know some some gaming

951
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,300
networks PlayStation network's for a

952
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,500
while but honestly those networks are

953
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,840
really not that hard to take down but

954
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,490
they're being leveraged and their name

955
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,590
is being leveraged as street cred to

956
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,570
make people pay these pay this extortion

957
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,330
note we are fed some squad you better

958
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:18,250
pay us X amount of Bitcoin otherwise

959
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,230
we're gonna need us you on this day and

960
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:23,230
people pay I don't blame them right I

961
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,000
mean if you're a system in this position

962
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,620
and you believe this is a credible

963
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,990
threat and you think that this is

964
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,520
not a time that our network can afford

965
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,890
to be taken down on a healthcare company

966
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,360
and I have open enrollment going on

967
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,190
right now there's no way that I can

968
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:36,940
afford this to happen

969
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,590
I'm gonna pay the Bitcoin it's an

970
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,510
insurance policy right even if it's a

971
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,890
you know a couple thousand bucks a

972
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:46,290
hundred thousand bucks I'm paying it sad

973
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,330
even scarier you know I'm a student of

974
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:52,960
electronic warfare anyone else yes the

975
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,750
one guy

976
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,430
you just fake rose your hand though

977
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:59,420
those sucky all right thanks man yeah so

978
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,190
electronic warfare right when you're

979
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,260
putting RF jamming on of targets there's

980
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,340
a lot of different ways to do it

981
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,230
you can pour all your RF under one

982
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,540
frequency continuous wave style and just

983
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,460
blast that RF and nobody's communicating

984
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,610
on that frequency or you can sweep you

985
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:16,400
can pulse you can barrage you can expand

986
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,170
your target range of are of radio

987
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,900
frequencies and adequately Jam them

988
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,000
still well thread actors have determined

989
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,890
hey I don't need to put all my DDoS

990
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:27,050
power on one IP address consistently I

991
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:30,230
can pulse across numerous targets which

992
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,750
expands their target surface right so

993
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,790
suddenly that you know the handful of IP

994
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,680
addresses that we're being ddosed can

995
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,330
turn into an whole IP range for your

996
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:41,180
entire network right that's pretty good

997
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:46,730
technological innovation what do you do

998
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:49,430
DDoS protection is you know a no-brainer

999
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,680
but fallback comms plans if you're on

1000
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,090
the defense side you have to have a

1001
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,010
fallback comms plan right I don't care

1002
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,150
if you're a small business medium

1003
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,220
business or a large business you got to

1004
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,050
have that that's just emergency action

1005
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:06,200
plan type stuff I don't even know the

1006
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,180
next slide it's yes the rise of the

1007
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,700
minors right I always equate this with

1008
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,170
like you know some sort of a like

1009
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,060
terminator or backdrop with like

1010
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,850
machines coming out of skulls and stuff

1011
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:19,130
so Bitcoin right blockchain is not a new

1012
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:21,050
idea right blockchain has been around

1013
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,220
for a while and the idea of

1014
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,810
decentralized digital currency has been

1015
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:24,710
around for a while

1016
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,540
Bitcoin was the first real company to

1017
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:30,230
implement it 2009 I think yeah 9 but

1018
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,720
what we didn't realize is that you know

1019
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,210
would be innovators on the crimeware

1020
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,740
actor side would weaponize

1021
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,360
cryptocurrency mining and start

1022
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,850
delivering mining payloads as secondary

1023
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,470
even primary payloads for their

1024
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:45,230
campaigns why it's a reliable revenue

1025
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,090
stream think about ransomware right if

1026
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,650
they know that they can get a couple

1027
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,470
bucks out of every infection more for

1028
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,960
dropping mining software why not why not

1029
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,100
do it even more disturbing than that is

1030
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,200
drive-by mining anyone read the articles

1031
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,710
about Showtime recently yes one guy

1032
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,740
I got to get with you Showtime right

1033
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,180
drive-by mining is essentially

1034
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,450
weaponized JavaScript on a web page so

1035
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,040
that when I browse it or my grandma

1036
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,320
browsers it or whoever browses it to you

1037
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,630
know stream videos watch Donnie Darko

1038
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,970
whatever I'm doing in the background

1039
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,130
that JavaScript is also going to be

1040
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,620
actively mining cryptocurrency while I'm

1041
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,290
streaming video brilliant concept right

1042
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,630
nobody's any of the wiser I mean if your

1043
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,100
performance is slow your bandwidth the

1044
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,390
slow when you're streaming video I mean

1045
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,400
I think that's an expectation a lot of

1046
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,020
TASIS right I'm buffering unless you're

1047
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,250
Paul and you went through your VPN

1048
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,390
you're screwing everyone on your

1049
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,490
knighted flight yeah Paul

1050
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:43,280
I know what's up right but there's a lot

1051
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,900
of questions about this there's a lot of

1052
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,370
debate about this right because

1053
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:48,770
cryptocurrency isn't illegal mining

1054
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,960
cryptocurrency is no legal you even

1055
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,180
drive-by mining of cryptocurrency in

1056
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,850
browser isn't illegal coin hive API is

1057
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,770
out there right it's a legitimate

1058
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:00,530
company pushing a capability to allow

1059
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:03,350
web developers to mine cryptocurrency in

1060
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,450
the browser space instead of instead of

1061
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:08,900
floating ads right who wants more ads no

1062
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,850
one right so if you're able to

1063
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:12,860
legitimately throttle and you know

1064
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,750
inform customer traffic to your website

1065
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,630
to say hey instead of ads we're doing

1066
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,590
this thing called you know

1067
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,360
cryptocurrency mining in the browser

1068
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,370
we're throttling it to a modest rate so

1069
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,810
as not to impact performance on your

1070
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,940
machine but you have a choice would you

1071
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,470
like ads or would you like the

1072
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,300
cryptocurrency mining and both of them

1073
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,680
will completely exit out as normal

1074
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,030
whenever you close your web page and

1075
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,860
browser no lasting impact to you or your

1076
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,660
machine that seems like a reasonable

1077
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,780
offering right now we're actors though

1078
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,790
have decided let's take advantage of

1079
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,860
this and let's completely peg your

1080
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,620
processor at 100% and pretty much melt

1081
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,180
your machine while you're watching

1082
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,310
Showtime videos right that's called

1083
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,940
crypto jacking right jerome Segura

1084
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,810
fellow Canadian guy in Vancouver

1085
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,490
Malwarebytes just published a good

1086
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:57,920
article by this just last week he and I

1087
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,240
were talking about it so check that out

1088
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,020
if you're interested

1089
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,080
definitely something cutting-edge and to

1090
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,970
boot it's so simple

1091
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,920
this is this is it this is

1092
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,480
cryptocurrency mining this is more

1093
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,730
narrow mining from a malicious payload a

1094
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,170
miner pillow that landed on a client

1095
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:12,590
machine

1096
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:15,710
it's just JSON very distinctive looking

1097
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,540
but go look up stratum or

1098
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,300
Travie straddle straddle excuse me is

1099
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,890
the most common protocol but everybody

1100
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:25,700
is just using clear JSON to to represent

1101
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,010
money traffic it's very distinctive very

1102
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:30,530
easy to see so remember that you see

1103
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:31,460
that in your network and it's not

1104
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,630
supposed to be there it should probably

1105
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,360
find out who's doing it right fire that

1106
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,840
guy how it's being delivered back to

1107
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,830
that ecosystem

1108
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:43,190
malvert izing tds is pushing against

1109
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,920
domain shadows and bulletproof hosting

1110
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,970
terror exploit kid has been delivering

1111
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:49,130
miners most of the summer i'm not

1112
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,080
heavily active but it's there it's

1113
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,660
present dropping ransomware and coin

1114
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,820
miners right diversification of revenue

1115
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,000
streams to crack up my grandma's machine

1116
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,310
again leave my grandma alone cash money

1117
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,980
right diversification of revenue streams

1118
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,350
that is a very sophisticated business

1119
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:10,370
business model right these guys these

1120
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:14,600
guys know what they're doing right see

1121
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:20,540
here so i mean in a funny story right so

1122
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,580
oh here we go new revenue stream yes

1123
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:29,720
right so i had a buddy who in 2011 i

1124
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,780
think but uh but 2000 bucks worth a

1125
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,780
Bitcoin right just under five hundred

1126
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,090
Bitcoin you guys have any idea how much

1127
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,220
money that's worth today about three and

1128
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,620
a half million dollars the big Quinn

1129
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,540
exchange he was hosting in on got hacked

1130
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,880
and it got taken from him consequently

1131
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,530
he's still working for RSA which kind of

1132
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:51,830
sucks right yeah I feel bad for the guys

1133
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:55,900
names Mike what can you do about this

1134
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,580
domain reputation services and threat

1135
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,650
Intel right threat Intel's underrated in

1136
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:02,360
a lot of cases for stuff like this right

1137
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,710
let your threat intelligence guys go to

1138
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,750
town on this if they can't tell you that

1139
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,000
this is a mining service happening then

1140
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,410
they're probably not worth what they're

1141
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:13,940
getting paid the last trend will talk

1142
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:18,170
about the prevalence of SSL and code

1143
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:20,930
signing certs does anyone remember back

1144
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:22,850
in the early days where everyone thought

1145
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:24,800
oh it's encrypted oh it's a signed

1146
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,660
executable it's safe it's good

1147
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,670
we know that's good right that that was

1148
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,920
like the common representation of

1149
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,310
encrypt

1150
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:33,260
to traffic and have signed executables

1151
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:36,110
in particular right that has changed

1152
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:38,480
dramatically right maybe a few years

1153
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,310
back nation state advanced actor

1154
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,780
campaigns decided we're gonna start

1155
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,160
encrypting all of our traffic right

1156
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,200
we're gonna steal an SSL cert from

1157
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,940
somebody or borrow and as a self-serve

1158
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,950
from somebody we're gonna get in a Salah

1159
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,840
chain and compromise a code signing cert

1160
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,880
for a company maybe a self signed one so

1161
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,190
we can sign our executable right well

1162
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:58,040
that has trickled down to a lot more

1163
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,320
crime where actors now we're seeing on a

1164
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,050
consistent basis crime where commodity

1165
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:04,790
crime were actors using encrypted

1166
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:07,880
communications cryptid C to write trick

1167
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,560
bot Retief CCleaner

1168
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,410
these are all big viral opportunistic

1169
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:15,050
campaigns that using cryptid situ comms

1170
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,600
all right self-signed cert s-- we're

1171
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,070
seeing that on the rise dramatically as

1172
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:21,470
well and that's especially disturbing

1173
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,720
when you think about what might be in

1174
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,000
your route cert store right when's the

1175
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,140
last time you guys all looked at your

1176
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,820
you know on your microsoft box in the

1177
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:33,350
root certificate store anyone anyone

1178
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:35,840
recently anyone in the last year left in

1179
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,310
their root certificate store one two

1180
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:40,250
three four okay a handful of people all

1181
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:42,580
right what's really disturbing is that

1182
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,470
we don't know what's in our root most

1183
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:47,600
fundamentally trusted certificate store

1184
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,550
for our machines this is the ability to

1185
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:52,460
decrypt your ssl communications this is

1186
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,290
the ability to completely root your

1187
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:56,630
device your machine right a great

1188
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:58,100
example of how actors have taken

1189
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,060
advantage of this in the supply chain

1190
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,240
attack fashion is savvy tech audio savvy

1191
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,040
tech is a Taiwanese company chip

1192
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,500
manufacturer and high def you know

1193
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,980
computer audio manufacturer right savvy

1194
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,660
tech and all of the infinite wisdom

1195
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,870
decided we want to support Windows XP

1196
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:18,080
through Windows 2010 Windows XP didn't

1197
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,940
have to go through the whe QL process as

1198
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,740
far as certificate validation and

1199
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,900
approval process with Microsoft so to

1200
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,120
support Windows XP savvy tech created a

1201
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,700
self-signed cert said hey alright we'll

1202
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,200
use the self sensor to cover here and

1203
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,880
actually it's a common practice among a

1204
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,250
lot of vendors but what isn't the common

1205
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,500
practice is savvy decided we're gonna

1206
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,440
bundle all of our drivers together so XP

1207
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,850
through Windows 2000 tender in one

1208
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:42,410
bundle and all the certs are in one

1209
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:45,650
bundle so if I buy a new savvy tech

1210
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,020
plug it in and stall the USB drivers and

1211
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,540
I'm on Windows 10 that Windows XP cert

1212
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,150
gets inserted into my root store whether

1213
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:58,340
I'm on XP or not that is a concern right

1214
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,090
I mean honestly that is such a porn in

1215
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:03,560
irresponsible practice by those guys any

1216
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,570
of those thousands of devices running

1217
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:07,810
Satya savy audio tech device drivers

1218
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:10,460
suddenly have introduced a massive

1219
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,720
vulnerability to their customer base

1220
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,870
right and if that root certaPro Vicki

1221
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:17,510
gets compromised that Taiwanese certain

1222
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:19,880
gets compromised then all of those

1223
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,190
devices immediately susceptible to being

1224
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:24,920
routed and SSL decryption that's huge

1225
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,440
that is freaking huge right and they're

1226
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,780
not the only one there are a handful of

1227
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,250
these that we're aware of and if these

1228
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,720
are just the ones that we're aware of

1229
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,460
there are obviously dozens more

1230
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,980
practices like this in industry scary

1231
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:40,960
scary stuff what can you do

1232
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,980
certificate whitelisting blacklisting

1233
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:45,710
number one obvious stuff know who you

1234
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:48,320
trust in your networks care about SSL

1235
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,210
cert metadata and this is one you can

1236
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:51,620
take advantage of right now cry more

1237
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,090
actors they're using this stuff are

1238
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:54,740
really sloppy in their implementation

1239
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,800
they're not even populating issuer

1240
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,550
organization or if they are it's like a

1241
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,560
DG a blur or something that makes no

1242
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,560
sense right or Microsoft is one that I

1243
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,390
saw with a you instead of an oh and I'm

1244
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:07,910
like seriously Microsoft like this looks

1245
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,310
legit to you guys but this is not a hard

1246
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:12,920
problem for them to react to right if

1247
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,270
they clean this up and clean it up

1248
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:16,070
effectively it's gonna be increasingly

1249
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:17,480
more difficult to tell the difference

1250
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,250
between viable SSL certs

1251
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:22,250
and shady ones and then finally know

1252
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:24,770
what's in your root store please take a

1253
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,480
look at your home machines just do it

1254
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,770
just one time if you're drinking

1255
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:29,660
whatever I don't care take a look for

1256
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,460
five seconds and if the if you know

1257
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:32,660
what's in there everything that's in

1258
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,970
there call me and I will send you like a

1259
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:37,310
bottle of liquor all right I guarantee

1260
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:38,840
you all of us have something in there

1261
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,420
that we forgot about or not aware of

1262
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:47,930
scary all right so recap trends one

1263
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:49,910
malvert sizing mouse BAM those are the

1264
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:51,620
big players right now those new ones

1265
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,090
delivering traffic taking advantage of

1266
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:57,920
traffic to deliver badness to darknets

1267
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,150
not going away

1268
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:00,619
those guys are focus on credential

1269
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:02,239
harvesting they're more active than ever

1270
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:04,369
and better funded than ever

1271
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:07,180
three ransomware cryptocurrency mining

1272
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,469
reliable revenue streams for these guys

1273
00:49:09,469 --> 00:49:11,690
and anytime you have a reliable revenue

1274
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:13,609
stream it allows you to plan for the

1275
00:49:13,609 --> 00:49:18,799
future for botnet capabilities scary

1276
00:49:18,799 --> 00:49:21,200
scary stuff you think about what these

1277
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,430
botnets are gonna be doing when they're

1278
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:25,039
you know two million autonomous cars on

1279
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:27,859
the road in the year 2025 right if I'm

1280
00:49:27,859 --> 00:49:29,989
on a if I'm on a family trip with my

1281
00:49:29,989 --> 00:49:31,789
kids in the middle of the highway my

1282
00:49:31,789 --> 00:49:33,229
kids in the middle of a highway and

1283
00:49:33,229 --> 00:49:35,029
somebody locks down my autonomous car

1284
00:49:35,029 --> 00:49:36,969
I'm paying a couple Bitcoin guaranteed

1285
00:49:36,969 --> 00:49:42,049
guaranteed and finally increased

1286
00:49:42,049 --> 00:49:43,940
adoption of encryption is gonna make all

1287
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,680
of our lives more miserable it's gonna

1288
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,150
make it harder for us to defend our

1289
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,969
networks understand good from bad and to

1290
00:49:49,969 --> 00:49:51,920
really effectively do our jobs as

1291
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:58,400
cybersecurity folks and it's gonna blank

1292
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,609
out right now probably right that is the

1293
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:03,190
conclusion

1294
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:06,619
