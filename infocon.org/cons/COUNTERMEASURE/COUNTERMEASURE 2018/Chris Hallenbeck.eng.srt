[Music]

2
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,179
really the the Genesis for this talk is

3
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,869
some of the past experiences I had in

4
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,910
one of my last roles which was at

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,289
us-cert one caveat is it is a bit of

6
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,349
critique and criticism of some things

7
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,390
but ideally it should be about the

8
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,480
lessons learned right what went wrong

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,850
and how can we collectively as a

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,960
community do better

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,100
about information sharing briefly about

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,840
me I was the chief of the incident

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,910
response program for us searched for

14
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,890
about seven years I built and oversaw

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,160
that incident response program us-cert

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,859
moved from being pretty much a

17
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,539
coordination element receive reports in

18
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:05,760
disseminate information into actually

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,680
doing incident response deploying teams

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,560
in the field and that included for both

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,290
government victims as well as private

22
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,130
sector critical infrastructure after a

23
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,479
while doing that sort of thing you

24
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,640
quickly begin to realize the value of

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,759
being proactive rather than reactive so

26
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,420
that you can save yourself a lot of time

27
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,100
so that was an evolution for myself on

28
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,820
that front

29
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,740
previously time in the private sector

30
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,680
RSA AOL and the Time Warner companies

31
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,560
and then started out as a UNIX aside min

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,049
in a university environment and if you

33
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,450
ever want to learn how not to secure a

34
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,840
system put some students in front of it

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,799
they'll teach you real quick all right

36
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,530
well so I call this the infamous II win

37
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,409
and I'll explain why it is infamous and

38
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,250
what is an a win well so a win is an

39
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,649
early warning indicator notice prior to

40
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,450
the RSA intrusion in 2011 us cert

41
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,800
predominantly put out products in

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,730
two forms very bite-size easily easily

43
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,580
digestible bits of guidance that was

44
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,770
meant for public consumption and then

45
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,410
other documents that went out to

46
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,650
predominantly government agencies the

47
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,480
problem was those government documents

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,870
were long they were really in-depth

49
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,020
pieces of of analysis and that wasn't

50
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,640
actually the problem the problem was

51
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,640
doing those longer documents required a

52
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,180
lot more work through peer-review

53
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,330
approvals and that sort of thing so from

54
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,430
the time you observed something wrote up

55
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,350
your analysis of it and published it out

56
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,260
it could be a couple of weeks not

57
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,090
exactly ideal so the feedback we were

58
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,980
getting from government agencies was we

59
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,680
need this faster so early hence this

60
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,200
early warning indicator notice it was

61
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,330
just basically here's the indicators

62
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,480
maybe a two sentence blurb about what it

63
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,210
was about and went out to the agencies

64
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:17,700
that worked but it was still a PDF and

65
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,530
not exactly the ideal thing if you're

66
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,270
then trying to take that information and

67
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,180
put it into another system but still a

68
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,920
better evolution of it we could get the

69
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,560
e went out in a matter of 20 minutes

70
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,959
after a supervisor approved it off it

71
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,560
went but it was still intended mostly

72
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,280
for a government audience with the RSA

73
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,590
intrusion things really flipped really

74
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,110
fast remember I mentioned that you

75
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,090
assert didn't do Incident Response when

76
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,239
I first came on board the RSA intrusion

77
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,150
ended up being about the second actual

78
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,070
incident response we had ever done the

79
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,320
first one was an intrusion into the

80
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,800
Nasdaq so it was also the first time as

81
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,410
a government we had learned how to do a

82
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,660
multi-agency response the intelligence

83
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,030
community law enforcement and the iord

84
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,660
element from DHS so this was our second

85
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,690
go at really responding as a government

86
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,620
and because the victims for this thing

87
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,970
extended well beyond government you know

88
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,488
any number of private sector entities

89
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:23,250
had RSA tokens and were at risk as a

90
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,010
result of that breach so we had an

91
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,630
interesting conundrum

92
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,730
we didn't have any information products

93
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,680
that were really intended for that

94
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,970
audience

95
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,150
we had our a win structure but that was

96
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,190
targeted towards government and every

97
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,080
one of those products had a

98
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,530
classification marking on it

99
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,570
traditionally you might see it as

100
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:49,350
unclassified / / fo you owe for official

101
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,520
use only and that's really meant for you

102
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,350
know in government channels it's a way

103
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,060
of marking something that says hey this

104
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,000
normally should not be given out as a

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,270
part of a Freedom of Information request

106
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,040
if something has that marking you that

107
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,920
it needs a secondary review for that but

108
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,720
here we are putting that out for a

109
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,030
broader audience still not meant to go

110
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,670
out on a public website certainly the

111
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,500
challenge is when you tell someone it's

112
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,900
for official use only and the government

113
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,690
agency we're giving it to is a

114
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,620
regulatory agency for private sector

115
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,690
what constitutes official use can they

116
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,810
give it to those entities that they

117
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,520
regulate in the private sector that's an

118
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,830
official use but traditionally you don't

119
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,420
take those documents and distribute them

120
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,650
outside of government we were kind of

121
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,020
caught by surprise because one of those

122
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,640
entities the Office of the Comptroller

123
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,270
of currency part of the Treasury put it

124
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,630
out on a website meant for their

125
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,390
constituency and so it became infamous

126
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,220
as an a win because suddenly it was out

127
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,710
there very publicly in a way that we

128
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,810
couldn't control and if you'll notice

129
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,970
there's an a after the end of that

130
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,720
number that 11 - oh oh seven a that's a

131
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,560
revision well if we don't control where

132
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,840
it goes how it gets out there and how do

133
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,300
we get a new update out to them how do

134
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,650
we make sure everyone knows that there's

135
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,020
a new update - that was versioning so

136
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,300
that turned into a problem

137
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,190
and keep mine I said that this incident

138
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,740
was the second time that as a whole of

139
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,150
government we had come together to work

140
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,720
an intrusion one of the concerns from

141
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,190
law enforcement of course is they don't

142
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,140
want to burn an end intelligence

143
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,970
community they don't want to burn any of

144
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,130
their equities they don't want to tip

145
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,320
their hand to the bad guy and say what

146
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,490
we know about them

147
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,560
so the last thing you want to do is put

148
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,270
all these indicators in a document and

149
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,319
publish it on the internet so that was

150
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,090
our first fight was whether or not we

151
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,500
could even put this information together

152
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,580
into a document to distribute it out and

153
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,770
then it ends up on the Internet after

154
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,940
all so one of the things that law

155
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,740
enforcement and the Intel community said

156
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,919
is hey look this victim has actually

157
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,660
multiple intrusion actors that are

158
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,720
targeting them all the time so there's a

159
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,990
whole bunch of indicators of badness io

160
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,020
C's that we can put together including

161
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,030
the very specific ones for this an

162
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,310
incident but we'll put them all together

163
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,530
in one giant document we'll bury them in

164
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,740
the noise of a whole lot of known good

165
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,620
high-quality indicators of compromise

166
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,900
but we're just gonna bury it amongst all

167
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,490
of that and not call out the very

168
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,240
specific ones and this was a reasonable

169
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,250
compromise at the time because hey it's

170
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,780
all indicators of badness is not gonna

171
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,090
cause harm to anyone who receives this

172
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,680
and if they see an alert in one of their

173
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,259
systems it really is a bad thing so not

174
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:52,979
a problem the interesting thing was and

175
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,520
this is where more that infamy comes in

176
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,840
researchers started to rely on this

177
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,530
document as a basis for doing

178
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,449
attribution they looked at it and said

179
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,449
that if you had any match against this

180
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:08,940
activity any of these indicators it was

181
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,710
all the same actor because they didn't

182
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,320
know the backstory that this II win

183
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,460
actually had multiple actors multiple

184
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,949
intrusion actors in this same document

185
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:22,560
so they start doing research based off

186
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,240
of a bad assumption and they have no way

187
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,000
to cross-check that so that turned into

188
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,840
an interesting thing and I mentioned you

189
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,520
know our distribution channels for this

190
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,010
was really a challenge so how do we get

191
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:41,070
updates out to people prior to 2015

192
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,059
timeframe

193
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:45,420
yes sir pretty well pretty much all the

194
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,630
time stayed away from doing attribution

195
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,589
this is important

196
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:51,449
personally this is kind of one of my

197
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:55,200
soapbox items I think that most

198
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,330
cert organizations national level cert

199
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,040
organizations should be kind of like the

200
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,830
cyber red cross don't pick sides in the

201
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,050
battle just worry about the victims get

202
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,750
information out there that's your thing

203
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,640
you're helping victims of a cyber

204
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,710
incident that's it don't worry about who

205
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,500
it is that sits in the mix on either

206
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,690
side

207
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,520
so overall u.s. cert has stayed along

208
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,620
those lines but others have relied on

209
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,050
that information to do their own

210
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:25,350
attribution and as late as 2013 you'd

211
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,780
see this all the time and then I found

212
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,710
an article or a presentation rather from

213
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:36,660
someone at RSA and EMC in 2014 and so

214
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,600
they say the the general list of command

215
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,970
and control domains for the RSA attack

216
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,430
were published in a longer list and they

217
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,280
referenced that us sir eewan the early

218
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,440
revision not the later one because they

219
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,630
didn't have it access to it and then

220
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,400
they call out and say hey the important

221
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,460
domains in that that were relevant for

222
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,460
the specific activity and they claimed

223
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,350
they named which ones those were really

224
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,710
out of 23 indicators only four in that

225
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,330
document were actually irrelevant to

226
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,960
that specific intrusion actor so as far

227
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,140
as 2014 people were still mixing up the

228
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,580
attribution around it and this was the

229
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,110
first time that someone called it out

230
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,450
and said these things are really two

231
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:24,230
different animals in the same document I

232
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,700
mentioned you know the the naming

233
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,240
convention evens were that result of we

234
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,190
used to do these long-winded documents

235
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,230
we got into this this cycle of if we

236
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,450
didn't get it out there fast the

237
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,490
information wasn't as useful and that's

238
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,930
still true today there's even more

239
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,560
growing pressure today that information

240
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,720
isn't useful for very long if you take a

241
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,580
hash of a piece of malware minutes hours

242
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,490
later in some cases that hash really

243
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,290
isn't as relevant to any more because

244
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,630
the intrusion actors have already

245
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,110
updated their malware and so on but this

246
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,840
was really that first phase of

247
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,100
understanding that we need to get this

248
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,770
stuff out there

249
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,810
but the lesson learned is that we need a

250
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,940
better distribution channel for it and

251
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,300
then the markings markings on documents

252
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,420
really is where things took a different

253
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:27,960
change we we get traffic light protocol

254
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,170
so who here uses or is aware of the

255
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,570
traffic light protocol not everyone's

256
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,560
hands going up okay so imagine a traffic

257
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,570
light it's got three primary colors on

258
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:44,160
it red yellow and green basically just a

259
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,370
simple way of telling people how freely

260
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,080
they can distribute the information out

261
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,470
red that means that generally speaking

262
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,050
I'm giving that information to a person

263
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,730
they may not distribute it beyond

264
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,540
themselves without my consent yellow I

265
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,190
can give it to you and you can

266
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,420
distribute it to anyone in your

267
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,100
organization that has a need for that

268
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,430
information and then green you can

269
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,680
distribute it freely anywhere you

270
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,570
believe there's a need for it but not do

271
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,630
so publicly and then later on you see

272
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,210
the addition of white to that which

273
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,100
means distribute it wherever you want

274
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,610
including on public facing websites that

275
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,970
would have solved our markings and

276
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,700
expectations for that II win us err

277
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,070
didn't create the traffic light protocol

278
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,850
but us-cert certainly took a heavy usage

279
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,280
of it and definitely pushed it forward

280
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,690
pretty quickly because of all the

281
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,250
documents that they started marking with

282
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,910
it it still creates an interesting

283
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,800
problem we'll talk about that in a

284
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,350
minute

285
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,210
sticks and taxi this is where we start

286
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:55,730
to get into speeding up that

287
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,050
distribution of the information a little

288
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,460
bit in theory

289
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,460
sticks is just a way of creating

290
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,690
structured threat intelligence

291
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,030
information just structure around it

292
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,190
making so it so that it's machine

293
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,400
readable it's essentially XML under the

294
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,210
hood in earlier versions JSON in more

295
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:20,580
recent implementations because the

296
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,440
ability then is just to feed

297
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,720
into piece of software have it ingest it

298
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,500
and start searching for things when we

299
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,720
are distributing a wins there bf stat

300
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,030
required an analyst to open up that PDF

301
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,430
highlight stuff copy and paste and

302
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,140
copying and pasting never leads to

303
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,870
errors it never leads to omission of

304
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,910
characters or the inclusion of a null

305
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,740
character at the beginning of something

306
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,710
and an odd tab or whatever else never

307
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,100
happens so the idea was to have a way of

308
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,750
having just machine readable information

309
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,610
speeds things up that means that hey

310
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,380
everything will be just that much faster

311
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,790
and more accurate then you have taxi

312
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,830
which then allows machine to machine

313
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:12,420
communication a system can subscribe to

314
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,640
a feed automatically pull that

315
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,350
information down ingest it and take

316
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,190
action if you start talking about this

317
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,470
to senior leaders they start to get the

318
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,960
mistaken impression that this means that

319
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,320
you can take the human out of the loop

320
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,030
this means that you know I can just have

321
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,010
machines automatically in just this

322
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,240
information and take action like

323
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,930
blocking things until the first time

324
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,210
someone publishes an indicator that

325
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,800
happens to be for one of your own IP

326
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,150
addresses and you just blocked yourself

327
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:46,890
or a key business partner or it is a

328
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:51,540
hash for a legitimate file any number of

329
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,280
other things that can cause a problem

330
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,010
and that's really the other piece of

331
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,350
this it's garbage in kind of garbage out

332
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,810
kind of a problem it just speeds up how

333
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,760
quickly you get the garbage delivered to

334
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,970
you that's kind of the reality of things

335
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,920
structured formats sharing forums so I

336
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,180
sex and aisa's aisa's are a newer kind

337
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,330
of creation or an iteration on I sex

338
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,980
information sharing and analysis centers

339
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,780
it wouldn't be government if you didn't

340
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,870
have lots of acronyms by the way so

341
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,520
information and sharing and analysis

342
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,760
centers are generally set up along

343
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,010
industry verticals you have the FS I

344
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,180
sack the financial

345
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,710
mrs. Isacc you have an energy sector

346
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:45,900
Isacc and so on this allows us to be a

347
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,800
little more flexible with information

348
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,050
sharing you don't have to go to each

349
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,480
individual consumer of information and

350
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,340
get the information out there you just

351
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,260
need to get it to their Isacc they can

352
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,840
get it out to their members this creates

353
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,700
a problem though for traditional

354
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,460
understanding of traffic like protocol

355
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,290
if you recall traffic light protocol

356
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,350
says that if I share it with you you can

357
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,930
share it inside your organization well

358
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,920
if your organization is a nice ACK you

359
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,780
can only send it around inside the Isacc

360
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,490
but not necessarily to your members of

361
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,210
the Isacc so it became an interpretation

362
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,800
problem you know people get a little

363
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,650
pedantic with things and they wanted

364
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,560
clarification so there have been some

365
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,880
tweaks and modifications with the

366
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,940
understanding what TLP is gaeaf are the

367
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,640
first the form of incident response and

368
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,940
security teams has taken on an endeavour

369
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,330
around being the steward of TLP to kind

370
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,370
of keep those things clarified and

371
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,010
that's helped so that now people

372
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,780
understand generally speaking that if

373
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,690
it's TLP amber and you're giving it to a

374
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,610
sharing organization whose entire

375
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,290
purpose is to distribute it up to their

376
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,060
members that it's going to get it

377
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,770
distributed out to those members as well

378
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,630
the other issue is ok so I give you a

379
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,000
whole host of indicators give you a

380
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,440
whole bunch of them and it's timely

381
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,130
information you need to go search for it

382
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,319
it's all fine and good but if you don't

383
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,780
have the infrastructure on the other end

384
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,490
of it to consume that information and

385
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,220
then go search for those indicators

386
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,720
you're gonna have a problem and a

387
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,880
classic example of this in government

388
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,370
was the the US Office of Personnel

389
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,430
Management or OPM it's basically human

390
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,700
resources on steroids for the government

391
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,130
they also happen to hold all of the

392
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,090
security clearance information for

393
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,140
basically the majority of government

394
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,130
employees and all of that data

395
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,910
was exposed I got to work that intrusion

396
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,950
while I was still in government I also

397
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,380
was in the middle of my five year

398
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,140
periodic review of my clearance that

399
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,550
meant that I had to update my

400
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,240
information in that database

401
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,810
so a little aside on that it was painful

402
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,720
because our personnel Security office

403
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,090
couldn't be told about the breach we

404
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,500
needed to keep the number of people that

405
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,920
were aware of it to a minimum

406
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,470
the number of people over across all

407
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,760
government that really knew and

408
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,020
understood what was going on with that

409
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,240
breach was quite small until it was

410
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,660
public and each agency's personnel

411
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,750
security office couldn't be told so I

412
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,720
waited as long as I could

413
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,430
trying not to update my information in

414
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,770
that database just trying and then they

415
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,540
finally emailed me and said look you

416
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,370
have until the end of day tomorrow or

417
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,640
we're gonna suspend your clearance so I

418
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,380
kind of sat at my keyboard almost crying

419
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,660
to myself and then I realized well all

420
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,300
I'm doing is updating maybe three pieces

421
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,010
of information in this database if the

422
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,600
adversaries already got it

423
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,940
all I'm giving them is three little

424
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,060
minor updates so not a really a big loss

425
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,040
for me but just the realization that I

426
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,010
could be handing my information off

427
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,700
knowingly just rubbed me the wrong way

428
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,580
but back onto the topic we had a host of

429
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,200
indicators hundreds of indicators that

430
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,540
came out of that intrusion and we tasked

431
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,030
federal agencies and said hey you need

432
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,500
to go take these and search your

433
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,930
environment knowing and what type of a

434
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,390
tall order this is going to be can you

435
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,670
imagine giving people 30 days to take

436
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,800
action on something that's urgent and

437
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,660
saying hey or go search your environment

438
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,400
for these indicators we know the

439
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,790
indicators are perishable timewise it's

440
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,050
an urgent matter but we're gonna give

441
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,520
you 30 days to do it because we know

442
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,710
already that most of you can't execute

443
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,670
on this in real time at the end of the

444
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,580
30 days the vast majority of agencies

445
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,440
came back and with a shoulder shrug and

446
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,690
said yeah we tried couldn't touch most

447
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,850
of our systems had no real way of

448
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,430
searching in a centralized repository to

449
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:03,309
even just search against our logs so

450
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:05,649
they just it was a shoulder shrug they

451
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:08,019
said this is great we tried but we

452
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:09,940
really couldn't search for most of it a

453
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,129
couple agencies very few actually came

454
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:15,129
back with definitive answers said we

455
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:16,600
touched all of our end points that we

456
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,240
know about and could touch and here's

457
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,889
those numbers here's what we think we

458
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:23,919
missed and no hits in our environment I

459
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,049
think there was two agencies that came

460
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:28,299
back that way the rest was mostly that

461
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:33,129
shoulder shrug so yeah if you have all

462
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:34,570
this data it's wonderful but if you

463
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,460
don't have a way of consuming it in a

464
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,190
meaningful way you're kind of up a creek

465
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,919
CDM is the continuous diagnostics and

466
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:47,639
mitigation program that DHS is doing

467
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:50,980
basically what it is is a giant pot of

468
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,669
money with some program management

469
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:57,940
around it to structure security programs

470
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,610
for agencies and initially provide

471
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,039
funding to those agencies to go and buy

472
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,279
from a menu of solutions at each phase

473
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:08,860
of the program and then in the second or

474
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,779
third years and out years of the program

475
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:13,240
it's up to the agencies to pay for the

476
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,309
ongoing maintenance and subscription for

477
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:16,809
whatever they they bought in that first

478
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:20,669
part that DHS paid for in the first year

479
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:23,169
coming up there's a Phase three for that

480
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:26,230
that includes EDR so endpoint detection

481
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,289
and response capabilities so after

482
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,299
multiple years of this CDM program we're

483
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:33,519
finally getting to that phase where in

484
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:35,619
theory you can now reach out to those

485
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:38,860
endpoints and maybe run this long list

486
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,289
of indicators against them and start to

487
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:43,299
have that effect that you're desired for

488
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:46,480
but in government everything goes slowly

489
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,389
we're finally getting close to the end

490
00:21:49,389 --> 00:21:54,340
of that tunnel all right

491
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,190
so in theory many years have gone by we

492
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,659
should have learned all of our lessons

493
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:01,240
from the infamous II win and everything

494
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,820
else and then late 2015 early 2016 comes

495
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,029
along and we have grizzly step so this

496
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:15,389
was related to the u.s. election the

497
00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:17,110
alleged Russian in

498
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,780
ference in elections and the the code

499
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,080
name for it was called grizzly step that

500
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,049
document that was released was a

501
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:29,080
disaster in more ways than I think any

502
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,830
of us can count first of all the first

503
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,429
bad thing about it was you assert

504
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:38,170
actually went out and put out their name

505
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,480
on a document that included attribution

506
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,400
in it so you assert was lending it's

507
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,320
named and putting out attribution first

508
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,960
first thing that to me anyway violates

509
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,410
that cardinal rule they should have just

510
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,630
stuck with the technical indicators put

511
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,190
it out as a companion thing and that's

512
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,809
traditionally what would happen even

513
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:01,600
before I left government would be you

514
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,520
assert would put out a document that in

515
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,000
almost always was identical to what say

516
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,830
FBI would put out the difference would

517
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,080
be there'd be a section FBI would add

518
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,549
that would have the attribution piece

519
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:17,350
because just keeping them separate

520
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,750
getting out of that argument about who

521
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,450
did it and whether or not the indicators

522
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:27,040
are sufficient proof of who did it is an

523
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,299
important thing if you're all you're

524
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:29,380
trying to do is warn people that

525
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,000
something bad might be happening on your

526
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,040
network use these indicators and go look

527
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,890
for it don't get into the distracting

528
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,520
piece of the discussion of you know who

529
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,900
did it which is actually what ended up

530
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,850
happening with this document more and

531
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,740
more people were trying to battle back

532
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,470
and forth it really wasn't the Russians

533
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,690
it was really this a bunch of criminal

534
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,480
actors rather than discussing whether or

535
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,010
not the indicators were being found

536
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,260
someplace and whether that meant that

537
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:00,549
networks were being attacked the other

538
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:02,049
problem was it was rushed out the door

539
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:05,049
this document was very clearly rushed

540
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:06,700
out the door because of the number of

541
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,500
errors that were in it

542
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,390
there were IPs that weren't malicious

543
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,419
the one of the IPS had in it mapped to

544
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:17,110
the Microsoft comm telemetry site so

545
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,600
your windows 10 installation sends

546
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,910
certain telemetry information back that

547
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:26,200
IP was in there there was I believe the

548
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,380
IP for a null file in there do you want

549
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,970
to guess how many null files

550
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,160
basically empty files are on disk on any

551
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,180
given machine lots so you can imagine

552
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,890
the number of false positive you get if

553
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,690
you give people that hash and say go

554
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:43,150
search for that and many other things

555
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:48,520
like that the document lacked context it

556
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,490
lacked the ability to tell you hey if

557
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,070
you see this very low confidence

558
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,890
indicator combined with this other low

559
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,290
confidence indicator combined with this

560
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,200
low confidence indicator then you might

561
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,330
have a problem and still need to look

562
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,100
for one of these other two indicators to

563
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,640
gain higher confidence instead what

564
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,230
people did is they just took all of

565
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,970
those indicators treated them equally

566
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,520
and searched their environment for all

567
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,190
of them and if any one of them hid they

568
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,050
set off the alarm bells and they turned

569
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,780
it into a fire drill of epic proportions

570
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,260
so that's a problem that we we still

571
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,850
have we don't have a good way of

572
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,490
expressing confidence in indicators

573
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,950
individually and combining them in a

574
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,440
meaningful way so that people can build

575
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,210
a higher confidence out of a bunch of

576
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,960
lower confidence things there are

577
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,080
indications that that document initially

578
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,900
contained indicators from multiple

579
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,600
actors that sound familiar sounded like

580
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,140
something maybe we did in 2011 but the

581
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,660
problem with that is back then we

582
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,610
weren't doing attribution we weren't

583
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:01,540
adding a blame to someone and in this

584
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,940
case you're putting out a document that

585
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,930
has possibly multiple actors in it and

586
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:10,000
you're putting attribution to it so now

587
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,370
you're pouring gasoline on this already

588
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,400
big debate about whether it proves that

589
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,320
one actor did something or didn't do

590
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,500
something by conflating indicators from

591
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,530
multiple actors in one document more

592
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:28,690
distraction and in this case this was a

593
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,820
case where there was a huge push by

594
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,390
government to declassify information

595
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,500
there were a number of things that came

596
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,040
out of that that were rapidly

597
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,510
Declassified and get it out there very

598
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:44,720
very quickly under normal circumstances

599
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,370
something to be lauded in government

600
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,470
when government actually moves quickly

601
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,630
to declassify something and get it out

602
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,950
there for public consumption

603
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:55,039
that's a that's a good thing

604
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,440
in this case because they pushed it so

605
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,500
fast and arguably somewhat for political

606
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,679
reasons that ended up with a less than

607
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,409
optimal product lots of mistakes in it a

608
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:09,559
lot of issues one thing that people

609
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:10,789
don't understand when you're dealing

610
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:13,630
especially in the classified realms

611
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,250
there's an equities review process

612
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,460
essentially when you have multiple

613
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,130
intelligence organizations in the mix

614
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,870
there's a proposal to declassify a

615
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,090
particular piece of information and it's

616
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,100
sent around the ring of different

617
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,500
agencies to get their approval or

618
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,320
consent or their objections maybe to

619
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,809
releasing that document and this

620
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:38,750
coordination process takes time every

621
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,929
time you do it so it could also creates

622
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:43,700
a disincentive when there's political

623
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,809
pressure to get it out the door

624
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:48,230
yesterday if someone spots a mistake in

625
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:51,409
it everyone's gonna look at it and say

626
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:53,240
yeah you know what if we correct this

627
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,860
mistake we're gonna have to go back

628
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,289
through all the agencies to coordinate

629
00:27:57,289 --> 00:27:59,720
again and get their consent again so

630
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,179
we'll publish it out as is we'll worry

631
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:06,500
about fixing the mistakes later that's

632
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,179
great if all you're trying to do is meet

633
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:10,700
a political objective or pressure from

634
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,530
political so they get off your back but

635
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,809
it's not great if you're trying to have

636
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:16,700
people take meaningful action on this

637
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,020
information and also build a trustworthy

638
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,190
intelligence sharing program with the

639
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,470
public for the future right if they

640
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,000
can't trust you each time you push

641
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,640
something out they're probably gonna be

642
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,500
slower to act on the information you put

643
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:36,380
out the next time all right I had to

644
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:41,690
make the pun about bearable sorry there

645
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:45,320
was one critique after another sans blog

646
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,840
put out their critiques of the DHS and

647
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,039
FBI grisly step report reflections on

648
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:56,780
grisly step tenable which was

649
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,320
interesting

650
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,620
they urged more language different

651
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,060
language in it some of it was actually

652
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,310
around some of the attribution and being

653
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:09,020
more point pointed about attribution

654
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,250
rather than talking about the errors

655
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:16,020
necessarily in the document probably the

656
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,990
most even-handed piece of criticism came

657
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:23,910
from Robert M Lee his was a lot more

658
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:27,020
pragmatic it was very constructive

659
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,880
critique of things he offered guidance

660
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,370
on where it could have been improved

661
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,710
where their errors were and so on so his

662
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,990
was probably the best of all the

663
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:41,850
critiques that I did see this one was a

664
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,830
little brutal grizzly steppe report

665
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:51,510
fails to assist grizzly misstep hacking

666
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:55,730
report secure poorly done fatally flawed

667
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:59,430
and then you get into the part where

668
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,080
things really just kind of took our life

669
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,450
of their own people started using those

670
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,370
indicators looking around environments

671
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,590
and they found badness where maybe it

672
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,710
really didn't exist such as an

673
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:14,160
electrical company where they had a

674
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,920
laptop for someone who wasn't on the

675
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,990
grid control networks or anything else

676
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,030
and they had some hit for some indicator

677
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,730
not necessarily the full complements of

678
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,950
hits they would indicate that you had a

679
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,260
full blown intrusion just one or two

680
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,100
things that fired off but of course once

681
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,600
that information gets out there the

682
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,700
press takes a hold of it and it gets a

683
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,840
life of its own

684
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,270
Vermont utility finds alleged Russian

685
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:44,130
malware on computer did they really all

686
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:44,700
right

687
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,520
so turning the corner from that and what

688
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,470
lessons did we learn from that one

689
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,080
us-cert turned around and did something

690
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,910
in Reverse remember I said they they

691
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,620
used to have these longer winded

692
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,870
products that led us to Dewey winds

693
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,330
which eventually turned into publishing

694
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,130
information and sticks format and

695
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,190
getting it out through taxi what ended

696
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:12,000
up happening is us-cert said

697
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,340
that's with this we're we're actually

698
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:18,120
going to largely skip the interagency

699
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,550
process and we're just gonna write our

700
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,940
own analytic product so they did they

701
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,700
wrote a in-depth analytic product that

702
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,740
was akin to this old stuff that we used

703
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,230
to write years ago it takes a longer

704
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,930
time to do get the peer reviews done on

705
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,540
it just internally and they put it out

706
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,730
there and lo and behold the community

707
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,710
turned around said why didn't you give

708
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,930
us this to us in the first place this is

709
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:45,810
correct this is accurate it gives us a

710
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,940
lot more context so we can understand

711
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,190
the threat and understand what the

712
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,380
meaning of these indicators are it had

713
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,140
appendices that went through all sorts

714
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:58,020
of information and so you start to see

715
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,180
people thoughtfully going through that

716
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,430
product and giving the praise that it

717
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:06,330
deserved oh and I have to know some of

718
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:09,270
the folks behind pushing out this

719
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,640
product I was kind of privately texting

720
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,680
a bunch of them at the time saying look

721
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,950
better to ask for forgiveness you guys

722
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,920
did a lot of damage by you know just

723
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,560
hopping to the political drum on this

724
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,750
and getting out that first product you

725
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,010
need to get out something that's a

726
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,440
little bit better ask for forgiveness

727
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,960
later but just go write something that's

728
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,760
what you should have wrote the first

729
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,880
time and get it out there and that's

730
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,200
exactly what they did they kind of

731
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,550
published something out and then

732
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,020
everyone else kind of quietly in

733
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,660
government went okay and they walked

734
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,520
away from it rather than make a big deal

735
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,470
about the fact that they didn't ask for

736
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,060
permission on that one because it was

737
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,770
the right type of information to get out

738
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,820
there this report differs from the first

739
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,660
and is not as much an update rather a

740
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,600
companion the report does not suffer

741
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,130
from the same problems in the first

742
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,590
release the first release tried to

743
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,690
satisfy a poorly executed joint

744
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,810
statement and satify satisfy a range of

745
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:15,750
audiences mixing geopolitical topics

746
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:19,260
with technical details know what I said

747
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,040
yeah basically someone else on the

748
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,920
outside looking in said that product

749
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,810
original product was just so fatally

750
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,420
flawed because of the mixed messaging

751
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,950
the different audiences that were being

752
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,050
targeted and the different reasons for

753
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,540
putting out the product and they

754
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,790
recognized that us-cert when they did

755
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:41,490
this second product avoided all those

756
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:44,850
pitfalls the quality of this report is

757
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,070
much higher potentially illustrating

758
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:49,380
more care and learning the lessons of

759
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:55,500
the first reports and then DHS falls

760
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,930
right back into it I say this with love

761
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,450
like I said I came from there I love the

762
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:03,980
mission I continue to support them but

763
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,750
the automated indicator sharing program

764
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,880
has a long way to go

765
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,710
so AIS is nothing more than DHS's

766
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:17,100
instance of a taxi server it's meant to

767
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,560
automate that machine-to-machine piece

768
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,449
of getting information distributed very

769
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:24,150
quickly so that in theory people can

770
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:27,060
ingest it and take actions on it quickly

771
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:32,040
on their end the problem is it's still a

772
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,110
garbage in garbage out kind of a

773
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:39,480
situation DHS's program has minimal

774
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,820
vetting the met the vetting for this

775
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,030
information is almost entirely focused

776
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,040
on preventing personally identifiable

777
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,469
information from being distributed as a

778
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:52,350
part of those indicators it's to comply

779
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,239
with Privacy Act and other restrictions

780
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,110
and law and nothing else there are no

781
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,180
technical vetting of those indicators

782
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,270
they don't look for loopback IP address

783
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:06,480
they don't look for the null hash that

784
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,760
you might see come through so minimal

785
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,180
bits of vetting for technical accuracy

786
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:16,260
don't even make it into the mix they

787
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,630
don't run say legitimate binaries

788
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,360
against known whitelist that other parts

789
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,810
of government create like the NS r L

790
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:28,310
missed publishes massive white lists of

791
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:32,580
hashes of known good files called the NS

792
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,500
RL there's a number of other white lists

793
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,570
out there but they could take every hash

794
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,150
they get and run it against that list

795
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,740
not publish that as an indicator of

796
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,619
compromise because well by itself it's

797
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:45,510
not it's a legitimate file that could be

798
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:50,460
on disk somewhere they published tor

799
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,849
exit node IPs in in that that because

800
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:55,650
that was in the grisly step product and

801
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,680
guess what got pushed into a is that

802
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,460
first release of all that bad set of

803
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,200
indicators there was part of Gridley

804
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,900
step got pushed through a is to anyone

805
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,970
that consumed that data feed and pretty

806
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,369
much anyone in the world can consume the

807
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:15,470
the DHS a is feed I know

808
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:18,950
Japan consumes it I know other countries

809
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,630
at their level consume it in private

810
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,910
sector across a number of other

811
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,369
countries consume that information it's

812
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:29,700
high volume data with a pretty high

813
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,529
noise ratio with it as well

814
00:36:31,529 --> 00:36:33,720
so that's another issue with the

815
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,420
information and you can't distinguish

816
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,180
the types of threats so in that volume

817
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,760
of data I might have commodity malware I

818
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,599
might have privacy invading types of

819
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,539
malware potentially unwanted programs or

820
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,000
I might have nation-state activity and

821
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,150
if I as a consumer of that threat Intel

822
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,660
don't know which is which and it alerts

823
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,760
it just says I have this somewhere in my

824
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,490
environment how do I begin to prioritize

825
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:06,539
my alerting and my tasking of my sock

826
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:08,819
how do I tell them which of those alerts

827
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:12,569
to go after first I can't so it becomes

828
00:37:12,569 --> 00:37:16,020
hard to consume this data if you're a

829
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,470
federal agency within the US you talk to

830
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,549
the same server but you get two feeds of

831
00:37:23,549 --> 00:37:25,920
information there's a high quality high

832
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,799
fidelity stream of information that's

833
00:37:28,799 --> 00:37:32,490
for only federal agencies and the larger

834
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:35,160
bulk of information that AIS gives out

835
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,029
pretty much to anyone the problem is

836
00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:41,760
it's the same feed so as you log in as a

837
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,130
federal agency its commingled into one

838
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,980
data stream so you just took this really

839
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,529
high fidelity thing and just slip

840
00:37:49,529 --> 00:37:51,299
streamed it into all the other noise

841
00:37:51,299 --> 00:37:52,980
it kind of defeats the purpose

842
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,410
this taxi does have the ability to have

843
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,930
multiple sets of collections that you

844
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,850
can explicitly subscribe to if you're

845
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,430
authorized and that way agencies could

846
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,290
pick and choose from that so there's

847
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,510
still a lot of room to improve in in

848
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:13,560
this data feed one critique of it the

849
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,780
problem according to churnin is that

850
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,180
those caveats were not included in the

851
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,430
diversity step data that was loaded into

852
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:24,060
a is without that context we can't know

853
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:30,050
what to do with the data exactly the

854
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,609
office of the inspector general this is

855
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:35,220
an interesting element in all of the

856
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,710
federal agencies there's an inspector

857
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:41,340
general in each agency and frankly their

858
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,100
job is to find bad things mismanagement

859
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,530
whatever it's almost as if they haven't

860
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,060
done their job if they don't write an

861
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,220
incredibly negative report at least once

862
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,440
a quarter and put it in the press and

863
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,590
send a copy to Congress rather than

864
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:59,190
necessarily being constructive about

865
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,900
what they're finding and helping

866
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,990
agencies improve sometimes they can lose

867
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:08,220
their way just like the agency can this

868
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,530
was a example I think of cherry-picking

869
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:13,490
data and in a way that was a little bit

870
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:18,030
unfair to the AIA is one agency

871
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:22,050
representative told the IG that DHS

872
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,850
provided all these indicators and only

873
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,350
two or three of those indicators were

874
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,790
found to be malicious and related to

875
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:30,270
cyber events my guess is what the

876
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,910
meaning behind that was is that that

877
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:36,690
agency found two or three events as a

878
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:41,580
result of the AIS data but the absence

879
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,380
of finding something doesn't mean that

880
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,240
the data didn't have value just meant

881
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,450
that the intersection between those

882
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,160
indicators and the malicious actors

883
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,170
behind them and the actors that we're

884
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,480
targeting that agency wasn't that great

885
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,480
I mean that's all that really meant it

886
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,800
doesn't mean that the indicators

887
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,720
themselves didn't have value it just

888
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,720
depends on what agency you are and what

889
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,190
your threat picture is and whether or

890
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,690
not those

891
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,490
indicators necessarily apply to you at

892
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,980
that given time so I thought this was

893
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,569
interesting just because it was a cherry

894
00:40:12,569 --> 00:40:15,720
picking of a data point and a phrasing

895
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,030
that seems to make it sound incredibly

896
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:24,030
inefficient and not useful frankly it

897
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,520
has its problems I don't necessarily

898
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,140
agree that it's that bad

899
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,579
all right like I said it's not all bad

900
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:36,839
us-cert has made considerable progress

901
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,420
in this they've worked with the

902
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,119
international community to continue to

903
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:46,170
move things forward use of TLP through

904
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:49,829
their efforts and funding with with my

905
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:53,970
mitre the taxi and Styx feeds our

906
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,430
standards and then in 2015 they

907
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,410
transition that off to a separate

908
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,780
standards body that's publicly run under

909
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,050
oasis if any of you are interested in in

910
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,380
shaping that process engaging with Oasis

911
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,550
independent of DHS is how you do that so

912
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,710
they started it they funded it and then

913
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,780
they handed it off to a public standards

914
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,940
body and stepped away from that they

915
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,069
still participate but they're not the

916
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:27,180
lead despite all the mistakes most of

917
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,089
the commentary around those mistakes

918
00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:31,859
have been constructive and that's what's

919
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:33,930
necessary if all we do is bash people

920
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,849
and say that they're stupid or they

921
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:38,280
should have known better we're not gonna

922
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,900
get better about this they'll they'll

923
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,420
stop listening to that feedback if a

924
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,540
formal method doesn't work find an

925
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,060
informal one like find a co-worker or

926
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,160
colleague and text them and say hey you

927
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,720
guys really need to get another product

928
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,880
out there here's the issues with that we

929
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,829
see with this thing find other channels

930
00:41:55,829 --> 00:42:00,420
to get that feedback to them so if

931
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,160
you're gonna go and start consuming a

932
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,829
feed what should you expect from a

933
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:08,460
provider of that feed understand then

934
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,079
they should be able to tell you what

935
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,520
types of threats are generally going to

936
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,109
be covered in that threat an Intel feed

937
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:17,150
are you gonna see spyware crimeware or

938
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,650
nation-state related information in that

939
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:20,000
fee

940
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,820
or all three of those things right so

941
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,010
you need to have a conversation with

942
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:26,780
them what type of information did they

943
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:30,380
collect and/or do they even break it out

944
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,349
in that way what types of reviews do

945
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:35,720
they do on that data is it a fully

946
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,599
manual review is it a manual review with

947
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:42,050
some automated minimal QA to take away

948
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:45,500
the null hashes and loopback IPS and

949
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,750
other common things is it a fully

950
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,890
automated feed with just the minimal QA

951
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:55,700
and what is it good for can I take this

952
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,190
data and reliably push it out to my

953
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:00,320
endpoints and search for those

954
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,050
indicators of compromise or is the data

955
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,849
so high volume that the only way I can

956
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:07,430
look for it is to periodically mash it

957
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:10,250
against my sim or is it really only good

958
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,710
for science projects and data analytics

959
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:16,040
products or maybe doing thread Intel

960
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,840
research where I'm also doing my own

961
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,050
attribution work so understanding what

962
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:23,589
their data feed is suitable for using

963
00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:27,020
how often do they update it how often

964
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,470
they send out Corrections when they do

965
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:34,700
find an issue in that feed can they

966
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,369
express confidence in the indicators is

967
00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:38,690
there somewhere in there that they're

968
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:40,760
expressing their own confidence in those

969
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:46,820
indicators can they express confidence

970
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,560
in the source of the data that they're

971
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,180
receiving so if there's a regular

972
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,880
contributor can that source be given a

973
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,880
kind of a score so that over time

974
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,230
anything that comes from them tends to

975
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:00,080
have a confidence score with it as well

976
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,010
and a feedback process is critical can

977
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,660
you as a consumer of that data get

978
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,970
something back to them to tell them hey

979
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:11,869
there's errors in this or hey we need

980
00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:14,420
more clarity on something maybe even

981
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,400
providing your own scoring of how useful

982
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,930
you found that particular piece of

983
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:18,920
information

984
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,570
