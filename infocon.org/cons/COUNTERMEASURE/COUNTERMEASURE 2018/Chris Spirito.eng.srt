1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,760
I won't take too long about sort of how

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,890
I ended up here because it might help

3
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,570
explain a little bit about some of the

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,279
rules I'd like to to share with you

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,410
about how to succeed at multinational

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,349
cyber engagements all right so we go

7
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,810
back in time I grew up in New Jersey I

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,329
grew up about 20 minutes from New York

9
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,820
City right outside of Manhattan so it

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,260
was an easy bus ride or a train ride

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,450
into the city my parents were both

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,719
teachers and even better than that there

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,120
were both science teachers so my house

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,180
was largely about exploration and

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,300
unbounded learning so I was pretty lucky

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,219
to have the ability to pretty much break

17
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,809
anything in my house without getting

18
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,539
into into too much trouble and so I'd

19
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,199
say around the year 1981 I launched a

20
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,400
full-on information campaign in order to

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,010
be able to persuade my parents to buy me

22
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,950
an Apple computer and I was like super

23
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,600
excited about the idea of having a

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,880
computer and I had seen computers and

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,820
there were a few RadioShack computers in

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,500
the schools but I really really wanted

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,780
my own and it took me about a year to

28
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,670
convince my parents to make this

29
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,880
gigantic investment of two thousand US

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,100
dollars at the time to buying me a

31
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,189
computer and finally I think one day I

32
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,900
just walked into my bedroom and there

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,600
was sitting a an apple 2e computer with

34
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,869
two floppy disks and a monochrome screen

35
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,780
and I was pretty excited right because I

36
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,939
could finally now spend every waking

37
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,189
moment of my day when I was not in

38
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,979
school programming right which I think

39
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,780
maybe some people in the room might

40
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,479
appreciate the joy of being able to able

41
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,820
to do that and so that combined with a

42
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,869
local sort of RadioShack type store led

43
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,909
me to a lot of good adventures where I

44
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,250
would go buy lots of things to put

45
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,049
together and not realize how they should

46
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:08,878
go together because who reads

47
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,119
instructions are

48
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:12,280
or manuals how to do anything and I

49
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,080
would take things like wires that

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,370
certainly couldn't handle the capacity

51
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,340
of the power I wanted to put through

52
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,200
them and I hooked him up to batteries

53
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,420
and sure enough I'd end up lighting my

54
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,269
mother's car on fire one day because I

55
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:26,799
just didn't understand how our

56
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:28,930
electricity and these things worked but

57
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,730
that's sort of the mind of a hacker

58
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,090
right it's being able to sort of explore

59
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,890
our environment learn from our mistakes

60
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,049
and become a little bit better about how

61
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:41,110
we do things so flash forward a few more

62
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,900
years I end up at Boston College which

63
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,480
is a nice Jesuit University right

64
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,420
outside of Boston Massachusetts about

65
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,099
three months before graduation I

66
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:52,840
foolishly get caught breaking into you

67
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,700
the computer systems there and

68
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,560
thankfully because it's a Jesuit

69
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,420
university they believed more in

70
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,569
forgiveness than expelling me so I was

71
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:03,370
forced to write system security guys and

72
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,890
perform community service and do all

73
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,390
sorts of things that they make you do

74
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,890
and they think he did something terribly

75
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,420
wrong even though it wasn't really that

76
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,230
wrong and so by 1998 about five years

77
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,739
post graduation I finally find my way to

78
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,600
the mitre corporation and then the mitre

79
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,819
corporation is this federally funded

80
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,530
research and development center it's a

81
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,840
kind of a cool type of organization

82
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,670
where you essentially do all of your

83
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,340
work for the US government and so I had

84
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,650
this pretty cool boss I she hired me

85
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,780
into her group which was the information

86
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,750
warfare and secure systems engineering

87
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,700
groups that's a pretty cool you know

88
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,040
name of an of a group to join I have a

89
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,290
pretty cool boss and what she did is she

90
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,780
took me and she split me up into sort of

91
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,349
two types of projects right and so the

92
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:52,419
one type of project was mostly working

93
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:54,940
for this organization that was in Texas

94
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,769
at the time it was called the air force

95
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,540
information warfare Center and

96
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,310
essentially what would happen is this

97
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,980
this guy would show up and every couple

98
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,299
months he would show up with a bunch of

99
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:07,359
like things he needed right so things he

100
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:09,700
was interested in sort of learning about

101
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,290
and those things would be like hey you

102
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,930
know could you like just take a look at

103
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,358
the promiscuous mode on a networked hard

104
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:19,100
and tell me like how that works

105
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,470
what do you know about that or could you

106
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,500
tell me about how on a network how the

107
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,630
ARP cache works or could you just look

108
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,850
at this routing protocol and tell me

109
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,110
everything you know about it each of the

110
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,490
different versions of the protocol and

111
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,340
so it was very much technical analysis

112
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,410
on behalf of a customer who was

113
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,030
interested in doing whatever they were

114
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,650
interested in doing with this

115
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,660
information and so these are pretty good

116
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,340
tasks right because they allow you to

117
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,930
spend a lot of time looking at something

118
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,050
in a very very narrow way and you get to

119
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,820
learn every little sort of looking

120
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,430
cranny of that particular protocol right

121
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,200
and some of the things that you end up

122
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,510
finding out are well you know there are

123
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,280
these protocols that were implemented by

124
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,320
some very very thoughtful engineers but

125
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,720
then you have actually programmers who

126
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,520
actually implemented the protocol and

127
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,530
device drivers or put them into some

128
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,120
sort of firmware layer in order to

129
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,590
actually make them work on the device

130
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,870
and sure enough you know they would

131
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,990
induce into these particular drivers and

132
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,480
firmware updates and essentially the

133
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,590
vulnerability is that we're not

134
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,210
necessarily meant to be there but it's

135
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,100
you know it's it's not as easy as you

136
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,630
might think to implement a protocol

137
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,400
right in order to be able to make it

138
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,350
work secure as it is supposed to work

139
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,630
and so one hand I spent all this time

140
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,280
sort of thinking about you know how to

141
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,620
muck with people's things right and the

142
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,630
other side I sort of ended up in this

143
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,460
situation where my boss would send me

144
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,470
out into the field and that's other

145
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,970
thing that sort of a lot of minor

146
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,060
engineers do is you end up supporting

147
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,290
operational programs right and so she

148
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,930
sent me off to work with different armed

149
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,630
force organizations to help them look at

150
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,430
their operational systems right and so

151
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,840
we'd go out into the field and you'd

152
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,210
have this you know sort of Humvee and

153
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,470
the Humvee would have all of these

154
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,060
digital support systems the digital

155
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,470
support systems would have all these

156
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,270
functions and you would just sit there

157
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,040
and perform an analysis of all the

158
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,230
different systems are a part of the

159
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,700
military platform and then you would

160
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,650
talk to the officer and say well you

161
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,790
know the officer in charge or the

162
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,680
platform and say here's what this system

163
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,190
essentially does here the things I found

164
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,800
here are the things we can mitigate or

165
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,020
remediate and here's the risk you're

166
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,210
going to have to accept to operate this

167
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,520
device outside in the field right so

168
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,680
this sort of idea of risk assessment and

169
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,840
in certification accreditation and so it

170
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,180
sort of was a nice

171
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,669
you know a couple years but sort of my

172
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:36,039
first you know I guess governments I

173
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:38,500
cyber job right so half of it was like

174
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,600
very offense related and half of it was

175
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,820
very much defense related and trying to

176
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,520
understand both perspectives of how

177
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,070
these two worlds come together and so

178
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,720
you know a few years later I get a

179
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,910
little bored and tired because I'm 20

180
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,610
you know late 20s and I'll try something

181
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,560
new so I leave my turf you for a few

182
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,000
years and I not end up working for a

183
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,919
nanotechnology company but then you know

184
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:04,330
I get a little antsy to come back and

185
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,030
sort of contribute again to this pretty

186
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,550
cool and organization and the customers

187
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,000
they're supporting and so I end up back

188
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,949
at mitre and I end up in this

189
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:18,849
information op international operations

190
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:21,430
organization right so this was an office

191
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,440
at Hanscom Air Force Base and this was

192
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,720
the Air Force's

193
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,000
international projection to support what

194
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,130
we call foreign military sales cases and

195
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,320
security assistance cases and so in this

196
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,720
case country X would call up the US and

197
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,810
say hey we need some help with something

198
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,970
and the US would say ok we can help you

199
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,919
with that and they would transfer some

200
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,570
money and then you know the US

201
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,919
government would send us over to that

202
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:47,229
country in order to be able to help them

203
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:50,050
do whatever they needed to to do and and

204
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,449
so my first engagement and this is where

205
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:54,159
I suggest the things I've learned

206
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,659
through these international engagements

207
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:57,039
was now I've been sort of working

208
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,669
internationally for 11 years and spend

209
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:02,500
about four months a year four months of

210
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,659
each year away abroad supporting

211
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:07,150
different different customers and so my

212
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,009
first engagement was with the Government

213
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:10,930
of Japan and with the Japan Air

214
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,509
self-defense force right and so it was

215
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:15,490
sort of a pretty straightforward task an

216
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,039
engineering task really which was

217
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,419
support their missile defense function

218
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:23,229
help them do some modeling of missile

219
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:25,750
missiles in coming to Japan and help

220
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,389
them understand how they can essentially

221
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:30,039
launch their missiles and time in order

222
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:32,469
to intercept the missile that's incoming

223
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:34,809
yada yada so it's not just four or less

224
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,719
a MATLAB modeling job right and so I do

225
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,150
all this work and

226
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,979
and they would essentially send me over

227
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,650
to Tokyo every couple months in order to

228
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,810
be able to brief the customer but I was

229
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,790
always really interested in being able

230
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,010
to find out more and more things about

231
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,930
what's going on in the countries I was

232
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,029
working in and so I would reach out

233
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:55,680
ahead of time to people I was interested

234
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,830
in talking to and so one of the other

235
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,270
sort of side projects I had I was

236
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,370
working was this at the time it was a

237
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,350
classified counter unmanned systems

238
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,210
program which was essentially this

239
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,490
program to find things in the sky and

240
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,680
then be able to negate them right to get

241
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,540
rid of them because no one likes bad

242
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,940
things flying at your sensitive objects

243
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,370
right and so I reached out to this

244
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,350
organization called JAXA which was the

245
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,690
essentially the Japan version of NASA

246
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,029
and they're responsible for unmanned

247
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:26,730
systems and I said you know I found the

248
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,080
person who's responsible for unmanned

249
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,270
systems at JAXA I sent him an email and

250
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,940
I said hey can I meet with you next time

251
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,120
I'm in Japan and he's like sure right

252
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,500
you know I get an email back you know

253
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,140
happy to have you right so we go to

254
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,670
Japan we do our briefings for the

255
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,830
customer on the work we're there then

256
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,220
you know we get into the subway track

257
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,140
take the subway across town you know end

258
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,910
up out of the subway get into a taxi

259
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,040
against the taxi take it over to Jack's

260
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,380
and then we have this meeting just me

261
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,420
and one of the guys from the Japan

262
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,160
office who can perform the translation

263
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,740
for me like you know we go in and we

264
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,180
have some tea together and like halfway

265
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,980
through the meeting you know he's

266
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,020
conversing with my colleague in Japanese

267
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,120
and you know my colleague says to me you

268
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,089
know Chris you know he appreciates that

269
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:13,140
you're here but he doesn't really have

270
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,630
any idea why you're here and I go oh

271
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,130
that's sort of interesting right like he

272
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,600
doesn't just want to share with me just

273
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,850
because you know that's what we do and

274
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,529
he just like no that's not really a

275
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:24,839
cultural thing they do here like you're

276
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,940
he's like sort of being polite hosting

277
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,370
you but you know he definitely

278
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,900
understand what's up while you're here

279
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,820
I'm like I guess maybe I didn't really

280
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,050
think through this too much maybe I

281
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,760
should have felt a bit more about how he

282
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,120
would perceive my you know appearing on

283
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,260
his doorstep asking all these questions

284
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,690
I'm like I saw you put that into my my

285
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,370
mental bank of things that are

286
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,560
interesting to know about right and so

287
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,850
then the other thing I would do tell

288
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,230
other countries I would visit and this

289
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,570
again back in the the late 2000s is I

290
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,550
would find the

291
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,860
local cert team in that country I looked

292
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,510
them up and I'd reach out ahead of time

293
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,950
and say hey you know we're doing this

294
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,040
cyber work and I would be interested in

295
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,300
talking with you about what you're doing

296
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,850
at the cert in your country and then

297
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,220
same thing I find the local contact in

298
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,350
Japan and we set up a meeting and then

299
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,850
we go for this meeting and this is sort

300
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,530
of one of these like seminal moments

301
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,690
right in the in the in my career where I

302
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,100
was like we're sitting in the room and

303
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,200
again you know across this side of the

304
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,270
table there's the Americans and across

305
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,920
that side of the table or there the

306
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,630
Japanese cert guys and there's this guy

307
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,670
Masato song right and he's been around

308
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,290
the search community the first community

309
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,420
for forever so if you ever attend any of

310
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,520
the first conferences that you would

311
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,800
know Masato he's sort of a legend in the

312
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,080
search community and we're talking about

313
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,920
concepts about terminology and I said to

314
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,780
him I was like you know when I say to

315
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,420
you information sharing what does that

316
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,010
mean to you what is that what do you

317
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,480
mean by information sharing and he's

318
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,120
like well Chris you know information

319
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,940
sharing means you give information to me

320
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,660
and I go oh wait a second I go that does

321
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,820
not imply any sort of reciprocity so if

322
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,990
I set up an information sharing

323
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,880
relationship with you you're not gonna

324
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,130
give me anything back he goes well I

325
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,530
might but no I mean what you've

326
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,290
essentially asked me for is simply to

327
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,270
allow you to share information with me

328
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,420
oh all right that's sort of good to know

329
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,030
so what should I do and how should i

330
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,670
phrase this with you and he goes oh what

331
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,620
you want to ask for as an information

332
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,600
exchange agreement and information

333
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,610
exchange to us means that I give you

334
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,470
information you give me information we

335
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,030
have this relationship where now you

336
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,460
know we're doing your version of sharing

337
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,850
right I'm like huh that's sort of

338
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,610
interesting right because I hadn't

339
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,320
really thought of that so now when I

340
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,550
ever I meet with my international

341
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,560
customers ever since then I always use

342
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,120
the term information exchange which

343
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,250
really does seem to translate pretty

344
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,800
well across language and culture people

345
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,930
understand the idea of an exchange which

346
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,550
is a little different than this idea of

347
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,610
sharing and so rule number one which I

348
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,920
ended up coming up with was create and

349
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,480
normalized with Cabul

350
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,880
for cyber terminology right because we

351
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,800
need to do a pretty good job of being

352
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,170
able to deconflict you know essentially

353
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,830
what do we mean by the terms that we're

354
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,200
talking about right and so what this

355
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,150
ended up creating was two different work

356
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,610
programs and the first one I'll bring up

357
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,140
which i think is kind of nifty and I

358
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,510
think that you know we've probably heard

359
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,920
a little bit about this this week from

360
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,450
some of the different presentations was

361
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,000
we ended up doing a lot of what we call

362
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,850
the intersection of foreign language and

363
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,060
cyber analysis right so in this case we

364
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,600
wanted to understand how other

365
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,920
communities operating in the cyber

366
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,110
domain you were communicating relating

367
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,250
with each other what the social

368
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,260
structures looked like and so we did

369
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,170
some analysis of cybercrime forums if

370
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,480
you will and so here is just a picture

371
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,760
this is back from them in the mid to

372
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,250
early 2000 so this is a profile of

373
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,860
someone named smoochy and you know it

374
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,600
you can see right here you know there's

375
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,850
some information about them the founder

376
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,500
and administrator so they have some sort

377
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,660
of status in this community so we can

378
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,400
look through that and figure that out

379
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,830
yeah when we go down to here and we see

380
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,390
a post thing about well you know how

381
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,290
good is how was a good reputation and

382
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,850
weight accrued in this community right

383
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,550
how do I become a elevated member of

384
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,900
this community and these communities

385
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,450
were recording communities so these are

386
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,850
the people who steal credit card numbers

387
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,890
go out and put them on to the physical

388
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,680
plastic send out people all over the

389
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,300
world to actually go put through plastic

390
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,490
into the HTM and then steal lots of

391
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,170
money within like you know 30 minutes

392
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,000
millions of dollars get transferred out

393
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,950
so this is the type of communities that

394
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,160
we were analyzing in this and so as you

395
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,660
can see here we have a registration date

396
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,430
number of messages and status and so

397
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,440
from here we can determine you know the

398
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,210
sort of a person's reputation within the

399
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,280
community which is sort of nifty to say

400
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,870
and then we see well your level of

401
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,940
activity will promote the enhancement of

402
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,560
your application of your reputation so

403
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,540
the more you contribute the more you'll

404
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,370
receive back from the community which is

405
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,620
sort of a nifty to know right and so

406
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,880
then we have this sort of like game

407
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,740
theory approach to figuring it out you

408
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,020
know what makes someone most successful

409
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,420
and really the end result ends up being

410
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,699
the more that you

411
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:15,350
err the more that you exchange with

412
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,029
others the more that you end up

413
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:18,859
receiving back from the community right

414
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:21,019
which sort of makes a lot of sense

415
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:23,179
except that in a community which is

416
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:25,249
largely built around crime about

417
00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:27,259
criminal activity you know exchanging

418
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,540
information isn't always the most sort

419
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,829
of comfortable or common thing

420
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,540
essentially you know you're giving up

421
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,279
all this information about these illegal

422
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:37,209
activities or actions that you're taking

423
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:42,109
and so we see through here these

424
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,970
different forum posts come up which

425
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,949
essentially were now brokers in the

426
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:47,470
community which would help out with

427
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,149
verifying people within the different

428
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,069
Harding communities so a verified are

429
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:54,049
you people deserve our trust

430
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:57,019
you know this our arbic arbitration

431
00:15:57,019 --> 00:15:58,850
service so let's say you give someone

432
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,319
some information or give them some card

433
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:03,350
information they turn did not give you

434
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,480
back the money that you asked for and

435
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,919
all of a sudden you know you want to be

436
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,389
able to arbitrate that dispute and so

437
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:09,619
their arbitrators who would help you

438
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:11,839
with that and finally some black lists

439
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,220
for people who you should never deal

440
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,959
with so these were things that we found

441
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,790
through really analyzing the communities

442
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,730
right and so and then a blacklist so

443
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,470
these are some sort of interesting

444
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,329
things here where now you have people

445
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,730
you know sort of you know vetting people

446
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,649
into the community you know oh you know

447
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:30,499
you're I'm scammer 891 your friend

448
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:32,989
referred me I'm Boris about 65 from

449
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:34,970
fraudster you know we have people who

450
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,439
can vouch for each other so now we can

451
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:39,160
do our cyber business together but

452
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,600
essentially what we encountered through

453
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,939
this analysis is sort of a couple things

454
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:46,339
first thing was we were analyzing this

455
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,589
forum data but what we were also

456
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:51,079
analyzing at the time was a collection

457
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:53,869
of what we let us say were instant

458
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:56,049
messages that were being sent between

459
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,789
forum members so it turns out that

460
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:01,369
someone who is sort of a central figure

461
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:03,519
in one of the criminal organizations

462
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,888
didn't do a very good job of sanitizing

463
00:17:06,888 --> 00:17:10,309
their computer before it was taken taken

464
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:12,319
over by a law enforcement agency and

465
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,439
summarily passed to us for analysis and

466
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,388
so in this case we now we're looking not

467
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:18,859
only through forum posts we're also

468
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:20,599
looking through this idea of you know

469
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,069
what we call computer mediated

470
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,959
communication

471
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,970
so text messages and instant messages

472
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,339
and so forth and so we found a lot of

473
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,470
like issues with the information we were

474
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,230
analyzing where these misspellings you

475
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,970
know length of messages were shortened

476
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,830
and therefore there was some compression

477
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,929
of the words and so forth and so what we

478
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:40,570
ended up with was this this idea these

479
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,850
orthographic variations and you know for

480
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,110
the Russian speakers in the room though

481
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,149
they'll have the most appreciation for

482
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,249
this particular chart right here so the

483
00:17:48,249 --> 00:17:50,139
first thing we found were these things

484
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:51,909
called transliterations right and so

485
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:54,549
those essentially are when you take a

486
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:57,249
foreign character and replace it with

487
00:17:57,249 --> 00:17:59,529
the the I will call the English

488
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:01,450
character you know equivalent if you

489
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,950
will so we saw lots of these

490
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,809
transliterations and so and when we were

491
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:05,799
looking through the different messages

492
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:08,110
we found like 11 different ways they

493
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,929
spelled you know Windows 10 for

494
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:12,639
Slackware a nine for Firefox and so

495
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:14,409
forth but I think that the more

496
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:15,999
interesting ones are sort of these ones

497
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:17,919
over here which we had to do a little

498
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,360
bit of work to figure out what what what

499
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,490
exactly are they trying for here so the

500
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,759
first one simply does representation of

501
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,840
pronounciation as you can see here and

502
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,179
so on the left hand side you can see the

503
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:30,159
formal Russian the center is this

504
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:32,440
computer mediated communication Russian

505
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,119
and then the translations on the right

506
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,549
here so you can see that the for Russian

507
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,759
is this after but the CMC was after and

508
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,799
so what they do is they would take how

509
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:44,019
you actually say the word and use that

510
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:46,389
within the actual like texts or instant

511
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:47,830
masters that they would be sending back

512
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,419
and forth between each other right so

513
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,490
that's sort of sort of nifty but the

514
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,110
abbreviations are pretty cool too right

515
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,809
and so all of you in the room here you

516
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:57,820
probably send text messages if you were

517
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,129
just in a text message and you put N P

518
00:19:00,129 --> 00:19:02,499
the letters NP into a message what does

519
00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:05,350
it mean no problem right so if you're

520
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,240
reading through of this you know Russian

521
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,580
text messages and you see an MP like oh

522
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,980
that must mean no problem right but it

523
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,600
turns out it doesn't mean no problem

524
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,820
because it means an option mirror or for

525
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,830
example right and so these are the types

526
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,529
of things we had started kind of pick up

527
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:22,389
on it's like Oh like so they're taking

528
00:19:22,389 --> 00:19:24,070
this and they're doing substitution and

529
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,960
so when you look at something like this

530
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,970
character right here right this looks

531
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,980
like at number four right but the number

532
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,399
four you know is

533
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:33,679
it's pronounced this right a little

534
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,360
differently the character and you look

535
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,279
differently so and you end up with the

536
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,929
substitution that they put in here and

537
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,970
finally it's the same thing here so if

538
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:43,340
you were to see like v7 in a text

539
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,899
message right you might say oh they must

540
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:47,330
be talking about like version 7 of some

541
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,370
sort of software or program whatever it

542
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,740
might be but it turns out 7 ends up

543
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,559
being cm which ends up being a shortened

544
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,299
version of to everyone here and then

545
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,820
this character appears again and evening

546
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,279
and as you can see here this this be

547
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:03,470
looking character is actually pronounced

548
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,499
in Russian as a V sound so what we would

549
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:08,869
do is we would see the V replaced by the

550
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:11,389
B and then the 7 with the Sam and so you

551
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:12,860
see these kind of substitutions take

552
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,720
place and then actually I guess the one

553
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,279
I get the most questions on is like

554
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,809
what's going on down here

555
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:20,389
and that's simply you know cool hackers

556
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:23,269
trying to use like English Latin

557
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:25,159
characters to represent Cyrillic

558
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:27,289
characters right so it's kind of cool to

559
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:28,700
instead of having like this Cyrillic

560
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,499
character here you would just use the

561
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:32,059
curly brackets right there and it'd be

562
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:34,100
like I'm a cool hacker right because

563
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,990
that's what cool hackers do and so these

564
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,309
are the types of information we would

565
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:40,940
find in all of these things that we were

566
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,980
analyzing and then finally there's this

567
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,429
idea of through Sony low tones right

568
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:48,950
those are just words that are acquired

569
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,960
into uh vocabulary words that didn't

570
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,059
exist but that now do exist right so in

571
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:55,850
the 2000s we have words like Google and

572
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,669
Mozilla you know PayPal so these are

573
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:00,139
things that would appear in the

574
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:02,240
vocabulary and then we'd see the sort of

575
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,499
the Russian equivalents that they came

576
00:21:03,499 --> 00:21:05,210
up with in their computer mediated

577
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,639
communication to how to represent those

578
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:10,279
particular words and then finally word a

579
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:12,799
fixations here so we're gonna borrow

580
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,629
words from different languages and then

581
00:21:14,629 --> 00:21:16,429
put them together in order to create

582
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:18,769
these new types of words and so this was

583
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:21,080
one part of the the work program that

584
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,809
was sort of spurred out of this sort of

585
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:26,450
idea of hey like you know the Oh foreign

586
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,249
language and cyber and the intersection

587
00:21:28,249 --> 00:21:30,409
is a pretty big deal how we sort of put

588
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:32,779
these terms together now the other side

589
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:38,570
of it is that around 2011 2012

590
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,880
I guess sent over to a Baltic nation

591
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,440
and we've been helping this baltic

592
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,810
nation for a long time with detailing

593
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,370
support so essentially how to integrate

594
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,800
fighter jets together to make sure that

595
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,080
they can fly in these sort of

596
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,300
multinational consortium efforts if you

597
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,430
will so if you have a NATO effort and a

598
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,140
bunch of countries come together to

599
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,820
support a NATO operation you want to be

600
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,080
able to make sure those jets can

601
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,790
communicate with each other that was the

602
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,110
core of the program but then they said

603
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,620
hey you know what about cyber we would

604
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,570
like your help on cyber and so the the

605
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,150
default your reaction was always in my

606
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,280
organization was show them the technical

607
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,310
stuff and I was always like well you

608
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,050
know we've been doing this for like

609
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,910
thirty years and they've been doing this

610
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,890
for like three months like they're not

611
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:25,470
gonna really appreciate a lot of the

612
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,670
things that we want to share with them

613
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,100
why don't we start and just talk to them

614
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,870
about vocabulary at first that's

615
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,340
probably a pretty good idea right we can

616
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,990
just sort of share with them some ideas

617
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:37,530
about you know what these words mean how

618
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,450
should we use them how do we communicate

619
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,070
with you what are the boundaries of the

620
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,350
words and so we created a couple tools

621
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,330
one was this tool called the

622
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,890
international cyber vocabulary which was

623
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,740
this visualization of European Union

624
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,260
cyber terms aligned to u.s. military

625
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,940
cyber term concepts

626
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,800
another thing we created was something

627
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,300
called lexicon which is in this

628
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,540
open-source tool and what's lexicon was

629
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,330
essentially was kind of like this but

630
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,970
urban dictionary so I mean most of you

631
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,350
probably use urban dictionary at some

632
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,510
point right so is an urban dictionary

633
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,760
there's an idea there's a word and then

634
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,590
inside of the urban dictionary context

635
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,110
you have the word being used in various

636
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,730
contexts so you can say well I use the

637
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,350
word this way or the term this way you

638
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,970
use the word that way so we just created

639
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,370
this flex akan so that multinational

640
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,110
teams who are working together could

641
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:28,110
take these terms that they both sort of

642
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,910
were using and put their different

643
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,250
definitions into the database in order

644
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,930
to be able to extract out these these

645
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,460
different meanings and everyone can make

646
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,630
sure that they weren't going to be

647
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,220
saying something that they shouldn't be

648
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,930
saying and so that was another example

649
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,360
of the language issue and said I want to

650
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,920
counter this deal it's sort of in every

651
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,300
international engagement so I was down

652
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,210
in Bahrain and the officer there said to

653
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,100
me hey you know we want to conduct

654
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,770
offensive cyber attacks in order to

655
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,600
collect intelligence information and I

656
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,770
go listen man

657
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,179
can't talk that way like people are

658
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:58,740
gonna like you know throw you out of the

659
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,160
room

660
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,350
I go what you really are trying to do is

661
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,030
something called computer network

662
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,860
exploitation which is the u.s. military

663
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,570
term essentially for collecting

664
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,340
intelligence right espionage and

665
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,870
espionage is allowable under

666
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,550
international law so the sort of no

667
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,200
issue with a country performing

668
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,600
espionage you can go compromise the u.s.

669
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,280
is OPM database just don't steal the

670
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,050
intellectual property right that's sort

671
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,510
of how that plays out and so you have

672
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,679
that example and then finally I guess

673
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,300
one more example I would say was you

674
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,700
know so I spent a lot of my time at the

675
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,410
International Atomic Energy Agency which

676
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,720
is part of United Nations and the idea

677
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,570
of the IAEA is to bring partner nations

678
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,090
together to work on common projects

679
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,710
right and so my very first project with

680
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,770
the IEA back when I was put there like

681
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,450
30% my time working for the State

682
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,030
Department was to help with developing a

683
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,460
computer security incident response plan

684
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,770
right in order for nuclear facilities

685
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,500
and in the room we had people and that

686
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,179
very first consultancy people in the

687
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,790
room from you know Turkey from India and

688
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:02,340
from Slovenia and from C hungry and then

689
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,380
finally I had a few more but Japan was

690
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,059
there as well right Japan seems to

691
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:07,830
circle around to these stories quite

692
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,390
frequently and so we were talking

693
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,400
talking about this term sabotage right

694
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,920
sabotage is a is a sort of a nuclear

695
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,720
term you know specific nuclear terms

696
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,760
also obviously a term that we use in the

697
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,679
the cyber domain but we went around the

698
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,450
room saying you know what does sabotage

699
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,429
mean to you right and you know people

700
00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:24,960
are like when someone comes into your

701
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,790
organization and tries to you do

702
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,309
something to a piece of hardware or

703
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:30,809
software something that you own and it

704
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:32,820
ends up you know just failing right and

705
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,230
we get to the Japanese guys and they're

706
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,240
like I don't know sabotage is when you

707
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,740
take a truck and you drive it through

708
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:42,179
the gates like I mean are you sure like

709
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,340
is that like that what you re like not

710
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,470
to explain this the right way and so

711
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,240
we'd go around a couple times and they

712
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,490
were very very insistent that sabotage

713
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,320
was like that's what it meant to them I

714
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,630
was like all right that's cool with me

715
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,950
we're just gonna make sure that everyone

716
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,870
in the room is clear that when we use

717
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,429
the word sabotage you should make sure

718
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:01,200
that we're you know we're talking to the

719
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,820
Japanese guys we use it in one way we

720
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,840
talk to everyone else we're using

721
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,220
another way we just need to make sure we

722
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,679
put this all together and so you know

723
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,240
that sort of brought me to this

724
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,000
idea of figuring out you know how does

725
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,950
how do the people you're working with

726
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,710
perceive the world right and that's sort

727
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,820
of why I share a little bit of my

728
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,020
background with you but I want you to

729
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,090
understand you know how I grew up you

730
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,970
know how I learned what makes me tick

731
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,800
and so when I worked with a lot of these

732
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,510
countries you know rule number two

733
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,740
anyone I'm working I'm trying to figure

734
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,530
out like what was their experience

735
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,940
growing up here what was school like for

736
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,520
them what was their first job like what

737
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,560
was what is it about like you know how

738
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,080
they exist that is sort of interesting

739
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,910
things interesting to know about them

740
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,860
right and so you know we would spend a

741
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,810
lot of time a long time but it sort of

742
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,160
there's the thing to know that people's

743
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,990
working with but one of the things I did

744
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,520
with this Baltic nation on the first

745
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,550
engagement was I I put onto the agenda

746
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,890
like a two-hour block of time to talk

747
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,980
about international cyber norms right so

748
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,530
this is just like normative behavior

749
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,810
these aren't things that we all sort of

750
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,760
agree upon but these are things that

751
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,130
when we talked about them allow us to

752
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,100
gain a good amount of insight into how

753
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,100
do you think about the world we live in

754
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,470
right and so we bring up these types of

755
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,820
rules so we can bring up the rule of

756
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,920
like the responsibility of lots a pretty

757
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,900
good rule which is the the fact that a

758
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,550
cyberattack has been launched from an

759
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,650
information system located in the

760
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,930
state's territory is evidence that the

761
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,420
act is attributable to that state right

762
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,340
now everyone reading that's gonna say

763
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,540
that's crazy

764
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,910
right like someone in Canada is gonna be

765
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:38,010
like oh like if the information system

766
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,110
is in Canada we're responsible for this

767
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,910
cyber attack like no one's gonna agree

768
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,040
upon that but when you talk about these

769
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,630
types of rules you got to kind of figure

770
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,300
out like you know where do you stand on

771
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,830
this like you do you believe this is a

772
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,170
good idea just not implementable you

773
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,850
think this is a bad idea because that's

774
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,200
not something that you would ever do I'm

775
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,850
not sure and like so the cooperation

776
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,260
room is another probably a pretty good

777
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,030
rule to talk about which says the fact

778
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,770
that a cyber attack has been conducted

779
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:04,140
via information systems is its territory

780
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,880
creates a duty to cooperate with the

781
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,920
victim state right and so that way you

782
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,050
know if you have a cyber attack launched

783
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,330
against you you reach out to country X

784
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,970
and say hey you know I want your help

785
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,560
you know because I have the cyber attack

786
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,050
that country should say to you I'm happy

787
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,810
to help you right that's sort of the

788
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,670
cooperation rules so we have these rules

789
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,890
then and this turns out to be a pretty

790
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,900
good way in order to figure out you know

791
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,640
get people talking a little bit about

792
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,710
you know their background their norms

793
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,210
what they believe and what they sort of

794
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,250
don't believe in and then these helped

795
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,740
you and helped us better understand how

796
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,840
we could help them structure cyber

797
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,300
defense capabilities right because one

798
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,830
of the things that we need to sort know

799
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,690
from them was you know what do you

800
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,460
really want to accomplish with your

801
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,650
cyber defense goal what are you trying

802
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,850
to do here you're just trying to protect

803
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,800
your systems do you want some sort of

804
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,390
ability to be able to reach out and

805
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,490
touch someone really what are you trying

806
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,930
to what what's your what's your world

807
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,700
view and so being Stefano our

808
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,350
conversation is on this and based upon a

809
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,150
lot of the technical work we did you

810
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,800
know this is actually this actually was

811
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,330
written by someone and her knee and her

812
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:06,470
name is Anna content

813
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,660
she's an Estonian lawyer who's also a

814
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,230
cyber expert and and and so Anakin

815
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,060
actually and I worked together to help

816
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,400
this country write their first sort of

817
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,280
cyber operations guide legal guide so

818
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,600
what it was a lab of what's not

819
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,570
allowable for them based upon

820
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,470
international rules of international law

821
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,270
and that has to do with these questions

822
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,830
of like things like low Act right the

823
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,990
law of armed conflict and how cyber

824
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,910
attacks affect low happened so forth so

825
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,130
sort of a nifty way to be able to meld

826
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,470
together the technology of the policy

827
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,420
and the law so that way the country felt

828
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,180
like they had a path forward in order to

829
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,590
be able to accomplish their their cyber

830
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:48,290
goals right so I think that leaves right

831
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,510
to the next rule which was you know

832
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:53,060
building trust takes time and in social

833
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,640
engagements so here are the things that

834
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,830
I've done with my Mike I guess

835
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,170
colleagues my customers right and so

836
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,500
certainly you know karaoke is is a very

837
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,360
nice team-building activity we all love

838
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,340
to sing together even if we're not very

839
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,800
good singers if you're in Korea you know

840
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,840
you have enough sake bombs and you know

841
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,490
it doesn't really matter how good or bad

842
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:14,900
of a singer you are you're just all

843
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,820
happy to be together singing right you

844
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,330
know certainly sushi is good saunas

845
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,740
what's up with the Baltic States and the

846
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,930
saunas everyone wants to constantly get

847
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,180
naked with you right it's like a long

848
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,380
day I've worked won't you come have a

849
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,790
beer with me and then we'll get naked

850
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,410
together which is like all right that's

851
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,210
sort of an odd thing but we'll see how

852
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:32,600
that goes

853
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,520
and finally you know death

854
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,770
so when I was working in this one

855
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,690
country I was introduced to the death

856
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,640
metal culture right and as it was

857
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,620
explained to me like you know it's so

858
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,980
dark here all year long you have a

859
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:52,460
question or yeah maybe

860
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,840
I think the Finns have both the highest

861
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,570
population of both death metal bands as

862
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:05,090
well as saunas per person yes so you

863
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,770
know it's sort of a but you know it's

864
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,300
it's sort of it's a great way to

865
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,480
understand you know like how how does

866
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,280
this country think right so they're in

867
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,930
the dark you know like seven months a

868
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,700
year right it's like agreement the truth

869
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,750
10:00 a.m. you know sun's rising 2 p.m.

870
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,810
Sun setting and you know my colleague

871
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,280
would always say Chris you have to come

872
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,570
to these concerts it's a good way to

873
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,850
release your your courage II and it

874
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,980
makes you feel good and sure enough I

875
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,850
would go to these like death metal

876
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,860
concerts and it was it was super fun I

877
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,270
think actually that a picture right

878
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,300
there is from a band this does this will

879
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,790
unfortunately give it away but Sabaton

880
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,580
which is sort of a nationalistic band in

881
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,830
this country which is a great band and

882
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,270
it's fun to go to the concert and

883
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:50,540
everyone there is chanting the national

884
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,400
anthems and things it's very very fun so

885
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,960
these are the things that you know we do

886
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,220
in order to be able to create these

887
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,230
relationships and of course it takes a

888
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,120
lot of time and so the one thing we know

889
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,680
about cyber which is maybe a little bit

890
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,060
different than everything else is simply

891
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,610
that you know revealing cyber

892
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:07,880
vulnerabilities is a bit like you know

893
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,120
really exposing yourself to everybody

894
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,820
right like it's very very very

895
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,040
uncomfortable for people to share with

896
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,920
others how they've been compromised in

897
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,300
the past right how they've been

898
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,800
compromised recently and I have like I

899
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,470
guess two specific cases which you know

900
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:27,020
really it were meaningful to me and one

901
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,850
again was you know I was in the basement

902
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,770
of the one of these buildings in Itchy

903
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,540
gaya which was the Japan Ministry of

904
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,490
Defense's and you know I had met with

905
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,010
this Japanese officer three years

906
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,260
right on this one project and every time

907
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,310
I'm there like I am just a share

908
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,530
information exchanger I take whatever I

909
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,460
know

910
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,880
love spreading love right and for years

911
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,270
he gave me nothing right and finally one

912
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,960
day he is like Chris I have a problem

913
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,760
I'm like oh really and he had like a

914
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,250
full like 11 piece out of this intrusion

915
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,530
that they had into their facility and he

916
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,960
is like can you help us and I'm like

917
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,429
totally like that's what I've been

918
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:10,169
waiting for like for all these years but

919
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:11,910
it took like three years for you to get

920
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,200
to the point for you to trust me enough

921
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,750
to help you in this in this moment right

922
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,429
and so I was like that that's sort of a

923
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:21,660
very sort of meaningful okay that's sort

924
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,580
of a very very meaningful thing to see

925
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,020
it so build this relationship over time

926
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,419
and then from that you know come before

927
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:30,150
it so the other point I'd make is that

928
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:34,950
you know it's very easy to sell someone

929
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,820
a product it's not so easy to help them

930
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,640
develop the capability and so we spend a

931
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,309
ton of time with customers simply

932
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:46,620
copying them understand capability

933
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,299
development so this is one of the

934
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,130
biggest problems I would say that exists

935
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,950
is that so here this is just a mount of

936
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,350
money being spent by countries on like

937
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:58,230
military defense right defense prog

938
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,640
defense and intelligence projects right

939
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,049
and so when you look at these numbers

940
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:05,160
right this is from what early 2000 2010

941
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,010
timeframe that's a gigantic number like

942
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,050
a ton of money right here's the

943
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,570
percentage by country right so in Russia

944
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:17,159
and then so China Russia France United

945
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:20,609
Kingdom Japan Sweden and then Bahrain

946
00:34:20,609 --> 00:34:22,350
who I was spending a lot of time with

947
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,760
them at the time

948
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,239
so this country shows up and says we

949
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:27,918
want your help

950
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,929
u.s. vendor shows up and says oh sure no

951
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:32,639
problem you know here's your here's how

952
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,679
we can sell this to you here are the 400

953
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,699
people you're going to need to implement

954
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,340
it here's how it's just overwhelming to

955
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,020
them to be able to be able to implement

956
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,879
a capability that the US does with 40

957
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,530
people and they have like one person and

958
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,750
in the nuclear world I work in right now

959
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,510
it's even a sort of a more significant

960
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,399
problem where the number of you know

961
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,409
cyber security engineers that exist at

962
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:53,639
nuclear power plants and research

963
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,040
reactors are usually like less than five

964
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,079
and usually more like two or one right

965
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:00,670
having to help them implement any

966
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,279
capability is sort of a big task if you

967
00:35:03,279 --> 00:35:04,539
will but that's what we spend a lot of

968
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:05,950
time on and then store the first thing

969
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,019
that I'd like to talk to people about is

970
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:09,430
this sort of how to acquire a

971
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,839
capabilities and I teach them a little

972
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:13,089
about like hacker mentality right so

973
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:15,599
trying to understand you know how the

974
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,339
adversary that you're trying to defend

975
00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:21,339
against things right and so this is from

976
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:23,680
this personality characteristics of

977
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,589
hacker presentation I found and so so

978
00:35:26,589 --> 00:35:28,269
personality characteristics of hackers

979
00:35:28,269 --> 00:35:29,769
that's the first thing feel free to

980
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:32,019
raise your hand to self-identify high

981
00:35:32,019 --> 00:35:34,059
intelligence who here is high

982
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:36,459
intelligence now you're not probably

983
00:35:36,459 --> 00:35:38,859
saying all right you know I'm pretty

984
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:42,789
sure my intelligence right I mean no

985
00:35:42,789 --> 00:35:44,529
that's but you know high intelligence

986
00:35:44,529 --> 00:35:45,880
you know something that we sort of

987
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,910
identifies hacker mentality right

988
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,619
consuming curiosity if you're a hacker

989
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:52,660
you know and you can't solve a problem

990
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,839
what do you end up doing you end up not

991
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,579
sleeping for months trying to solve the

992
00:35:57,579 --> 00:36:00,009
stupid problem right it just bugs you to

993
00:36:00,009 --> 00:36:02,170
no end of this problem is sitting there

994
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,880
and you can't figure it out right so

995
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,519
there's this consuming curiosity to find

996
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:09,369
and like solve the problems comfortable

997
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:11,949
intellectual extractions stimulated by

998
00:36:11,949 --> 00:36:14,109
appreciating novelty now this part I

999
00:36:14,109 --> 00:36:15,609
always get a little troubling because

1000
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:18,069
you know whenever I have been looking at

1001
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:22,299
attacks even against my infrastructure

1002
00:36:22,299 --> 00:36:25,359
over time I don't take it personally I

1003
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,049
am just fascinated by the cleverness

1004
00:36:29,049 --> 00:36:32,709
that some attackers have used in order

1005
00:36:32,709 --> 00:36:34,539
to be able to make their way into my

1006
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:36,249
environment like I'm allowed to

1007
00:36:36,249 --> 00:36:38,829
appreciate the novelty and beauty of

1008
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,559
someone spending months two years of

1009
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:43,209
their life infiltrating my

1010
00:36:43,209 --> 00:36:45,219
infrastructure it's kind of cool right

1011
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:47,109
it doesn't mean that's a great outcome

1012
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:48,579
right because I still got work to do now

1013
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:51,779
but there's some novelty to it right and

1014
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:54,430
individualistic anti conformist I think

1015
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,410
that you know oh yeah I can appreciate

1016
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,029
that I'm not sure everyone's sort of

1017
00:36:58,029 --> 00:37:00,249
that way but nonetheless we try to teach

1018
00:37:00,249 --> 00:37:02,259
our customers about you know there's

1019
00:37:02,259 --> 00:37:03,880
sort of macro mentality the other thing

1020
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,799
I try to teach is this idea of you know

1021
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:07,959
how to develop capabilities over time

1022
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,729
and and a lot of times I give the

1023
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:11,170
analogy of like

1024
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,119
soccer or football and football tends to

1025
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,180
be a pretty good analogy of you know so

1026
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,010
I used to coach soccer and my thinner

1027
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,809
and you know younger days if you will

1028
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:21,880
and so the things we teach our players

1029
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,530
are things like you learning your core

1030
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,359
skills learning what to do in certain

1031
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:26,710
situations and there's a lot of

1032
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,750
parallels to cybersecurity right so if

1033
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,220
you're playing soccer playing football

1034
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,650
and you're on a 1v1 situation where you

1035
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,329
have the ball you know you have a choice

1036
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:34,720
to make

1037
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,460
right so you can punch it away right

1038
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,650
which is sort of a choice a lot of kids

1039
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,690
make or you can be brave enough to try a

1040
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:43,270
feint right you try come Maradona or you

1041
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,099
can try some sort of sweeping you can

1042
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:46,569
try to get around the defender fake them

1043
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:48,670
out and what we'd always tell you know

1044
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:51,130
the kids and say no if you try it you're

1045
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,690
going to learn something even if you

1046
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:55,000
fail you might say oh I tried to do this

1047
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,859
but I didn't read the defender correctly

1048
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:58,750
I tried to do this or I didn't you have

1049
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,040
the right foot skills in that moment or

1050
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,140
I try to do this I said the more things

1051
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,950
you try the better you're going to be at

1052
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,329
actually accomplishing the goal that you

1053
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:09,099
want to accomplish and this is one of

1054
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:10,329
the tougher things that we try to work

1055
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,069
with our customers with which is the

1056
00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:14,650
idea of we try to stop the

1057
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:17,740
stigmatization of failure right failure

1058
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,900
in cyber is not a terrible thing you

1059
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,119
don't learn anything from succeeding all

1060
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:23,950
the time you're only going to learn how

1061
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,869
to get better as a cyber defender by

1062
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:27,670
failing at cyber defense right by

1063
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,440
actually seeing intrusions in your

1064
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,480
environment seeing how those actors made

1065
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,589
their way into your environment being

1066
00:38:32,589 --> 00:38:34,390
able to pivot off of that in order to

1067
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,579
create additional capabilities in your

1068
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:39,099
in your in your in your world right so

1069
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:40,869
we caught time working with customers on

1070
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:42,760
this capability development that also

1071
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,990
includes the ability to create

1072
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,919
curriculums

1073
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:51,040
for the different engineers in an

1074
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,930
organization how they can acquire their

1075
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,880
cyber capability so for us a lot of is

1076
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,710
how do we take information

1077
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,670
instrumentation and control engineers or

1078
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,559
nuclear engineers and make them more

1079
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:01,359
cyber savvy because it turns out it's a

1080
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,609
little bit easier to teach a nuclear

1081
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:05,530
engineer Seiler than it is to teach a

1082
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,480
sabra engineer nuclear engineering if

1083
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,069
you will so that was one over on our

1084
00:39:09,069 --> 00:39:11,200
fifth rule and the fifth final rule

1085
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,420
which was choose your team carefully and

1086
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,309
build together as often as possible

1087
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:17,829
right and so a we a little talk right

1088
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:20,260
before I started talking here about you

1089
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,970
know onboarding new team members

1090
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,540
especially to international and

1091
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,360
and there's a lot of sort of nuance when

1092
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,500
it comes to working with our

1093
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,270
international partners certainly

1094
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,040
cultural nuance to understanding how to

1095
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,240
interact with different cultures

1096
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,090
certainly being able to listen very very

1097
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:38,270
carefully to understand exactly what

1098
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,580
they're trying to convey to you and not

1099
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,800
miss reading different signals that you

1100
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,140
might be a corner and so the the one

1101
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,640
example the common the many the best

1102
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,460
example I'll give of this was USP comm

1103
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,290
which is in Hawaii

1104
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:54,200
so essentially US PACOM manages Japan

1105
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,630
and Korea network connections if you

1106
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,280
will for classified information exchange

1107
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,340
alright so in the room Japanese officers

1108
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,850
American officers Korean officers

1109
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:06,110
American officer says hey I have a good

1110
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,820
idea let's build out a secure email

1111
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,770
platform for us all to use right and he

1112
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,570
looks over to the Japanese officers and

1113
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:14,120
they're like it's over the Korean

1114
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,640
offices and they're like he's like oh

1115
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,890
cool so we can start right and so they

1116
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,270
go build out this thing and three months

1117
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,530
later the Japanese the Koreans was like

1118
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:23,540
why would you do that we didn't want

1119
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,360
that because he simply just misread

1120
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,450
their politeness of saying oh okay like

1121
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,910
thank you for your idea as a actual oh

1122
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,440
we should move forward and do this and

1123
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,180
so there really is a lot of nuance

1124
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,530
working with our international partners

1125
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,180
to figuring out you know what do they

1126
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,820
really mean by their hand gestures and

1127
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,320
their signals and and then the words

1128
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,840
they say and so finally this past

1129
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,080
September I ran a big technical meeting

1130
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,480
at the IAEA and the technical meeting

1131
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,450
was on conducting how to create exercise

1132
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,910
scenarios for nuclear facilities for

1133
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,370
cyberattacks right and so I think

1134
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,690
probably most of you are familiar with

1135
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,220
this cyber attack lifecycle or the cyber

1136
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,350
kill chain the office of the defense

1137
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,490
National Intelligence in the u.s.

1138
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,680
produced last year something called the

1139
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,150
odni cyber threat framework so

1140
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,890
essentially they took the seven stages

1141
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:12,320
and made them for which for my

1142
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,090
international customers was life-saving

1143
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,920
right because seven stages was a lot to

1144
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,780
consume four was much more approachable

1145
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,910
for them so I ended up structuring this

1146
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,350
entire technical meeting around this

1147
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:23,900
odni framework and from here so this is

1148
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,370
a sort of a view of what a

1149
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:27,580
representative looked like so there was

1150
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,290
70 representatives from I think about

1151
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,360
like you know 20 or so different

1152
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,520
countries brought them all together and

1153
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,220
then

1154
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,590
essentially the first two days were just

1155
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,940
panels of people presenting their

1156
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,610
exercise developing capability is the

1157
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,590
first panel which I did on purpose which

1158
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:46,710
was US Russia and China to see how they

1159
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,060
would get along and then the rest of the

1160
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,700
week was all the other experts so as you

1161
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,170
can see the the Swedish guy is the

1162
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,730
tallest guy in the front who was even

1163
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,010
taller than me standing a step below me

1164
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:58,560
so very very tall guy I always forgot to

1165
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,330
wear my suit pants on picture day so I

1166
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,410
don't look like I'm the guy who walked

1167
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,690
off the street but nonetheless here we

1168
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,970
are so I probably look exactly the same

1169
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:09,630
today all right all right so here are

1170
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:12,000
the scenario development team so this is

1171
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,200
something that was sort of an

1172
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,750
interesting challenge right we wanted to

1173
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,310
be able to break up the different

1174
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:22,230
countries by both you know Geographic so

1175
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,430
we wanted we wanted to have some

1176
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,080
geographic similarities right because

1177
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,100
one of the things we're always telling

1178
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,520
our customers is you know you have lots

1179
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,350
of friends in the community who help you

1180
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:33,630
if you simply ask all you have to do is

1181
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,250
find them and ask them and they'll help

1182
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,230
you out so we try to separate here by a

1183
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,600
bit Geographic congruence as well as

1184
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,190
being able to separate by what

1185
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,560
capabilities we know that the person

1186
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,410
attending had if you will so that's

1187
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:47,850
where in Canada you'll see there's two

1188
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:50,190
actually Canadians represented here Eric

1189
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,680
who works for the nuclear regulator here

1190
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,690
in Canada and Luke Dan Duran who's a

1191
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:57,090
Canadian military guy who worked for

1192
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,380
NATO for many years and now works for

1193
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,470
guard time so Luke ended up leading up

1194
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:02,640
the sensitive information breach

1195
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,810
scenario Eric was the sabotage scenario

1196
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,100
removal of material which is a big deal

1197
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,900
in our world removal nuclear material

1198
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,970
was sano from Slovenia and then a

1199
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:16,320
Christian he is a French nuclear expert

1200
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,120
and his actual specialty is on

1201
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,950
transportation security for nuclear

1202
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,540
material and so they were responsible

1203
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:25,110
for essentially taking taking this

1204
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,910
particular or denied framework and then

1205
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:29,070
creating a scenario around these

1206
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,230
concepts which was pretty cool and so

1207
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,280
what we had them do is we had them

1208
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,700
create a read scenario a blue scenario

1209
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,840
and then this sort of like a god-like

1210
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,030
scenario where you can say this is what

1211
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:40,830
the red team did and this is what they

1212
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:43,140
were able to accomplish this is what the

1213
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,220
blue team did this is what they were

1214
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,630
able to accomplish and this is what the

1215
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,310
the GAVI was what they both sort of

1216
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:48,839
missed out on so it was a

1217
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:50,489
really nice opportunity to do those and

1218
00:43:50,489 --> 00:43:52,710
the rule number five which is create

1219
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,779
things together and it was far more

1220
00:43:54,779 --> 00:43:56,759
successful than I I perhaps appreciated

1221
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:57,989
that it would be especially in both

1222
00:43:57,989 --> 00:43:59,849
creating relationships between these

1223
00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:01,920
different nuclear nation states as well

1224
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,809
as as sort of seeing some pretty cool

1225
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:06,210
nuclear scenarios come into play and so

1226
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,950
I think with that I think maybe a minute

1227
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:10,319
or two left right I was guessing pretty

1228
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,070
good time

1229
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:27,289
