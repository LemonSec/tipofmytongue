my name is William I'm a security

3
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:16,020
Solutions Architect with Cisco Systems I

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,600
wanted to talk a little bit about how we

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,390
deal with the nature of encryption

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,090
nowadays so I've been in this industry

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,590
for gosh I have 30 years now and wow

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,810
that's really a long time and we were

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,000
always huge advocates of saying we need

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,469
to encrypt we need to encrypt we need to

11
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,050
encrypt right makes sense right encrypt

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,129
data in in in storage encrypting transit

13
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:43,230
especially because we've got data that's

14
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,590
important it's critical it's sensitive

15
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:50,520
bad guys love encryption which is really

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,260
a challenge for us so of course the

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,879
answer was always hey well will decrypt

18
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,980
right but it's really not an easy thing

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,600
to do and it would be counterintuitive

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,260
to do that so we need to look at how we

21
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,660
approach encrypted traffic in a

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,760
different way

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,060
especially because we know now that the

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,680
majority of traffic on the Internet is

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,090
going dark we're not gonna be able to

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,760
start looking for threats because you

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,350
know frankly is it attacker when I play

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,330
an attack role I embed stuff in

29
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,920
encrypted sessions right I don't want

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,560
people looking at my pack media Google

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,780
is actually validated what NSS has been

32
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,520
saying and they're there reports on

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,740
where encryption is going Google's

34
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,540
saying about 80% of the traffic that

35
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,680
they see and all their chrome

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,479
environments and Android environments is

37
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,450
encrypted few years ago Apple even

38
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,070
required that all of their apps use TLS

39
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,250
encryption to ensure communications are

40
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,500
encrypted in transit so it really gets

41
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,119
to be a challenge now right how are we

42
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,470
going to be able to look at this

43
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,360
especially since decryption is expensive

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,090
and it usually doesn't work so what I

45
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,770
want to do is take a look a little bit

46
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,060
through what the encryption challenges

47
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,950
are and what are some strategies around

48
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,360
that now just sort of to cover the bases

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,280
here some of the slides are gonna look a

50
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,960
little producti I tried to deep

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,628
productize them and instead I want you

52
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:11,400
to listen for what the overall sort of

53
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,260
message and thinking and strategies

54
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,860
around

55
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,110
encryption our and how we can try to

56
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,940
address that so it's a challenge right I

57
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,590
know when we first started selling

58
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,860
decryption capabilities we were charging

59
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,080
yeah about $40,000 a gigabit and the

60
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,540
price hasn't really gone down much right

61
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,700
it's because it's expensive it's

62
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,710
challenging to decrypt traffic and that

63
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,450
was in the earlier days of just SSL

64
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,640
decryption if I had a private if I had

65
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,590
the keys I could deal with it maybe

66
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,360
deploy a man-in-the-middle decryption

67
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,090
but it's changing right with things like

68
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,990
certificate pinning with TLS 1.3 coming

69
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,730
out it's getting harder and harder to

70
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,489
deal with the ability to decrypt traffic

71
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:55,380
and looking for threats especially

72
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,570
because it also deals with privacy and

73
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,580
compliance issues we're trying to deal

74
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,940
with how we manage and maintain data

75
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,010
it's gonna be more and more complex even

76
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,480
as we go and we're gonna see a little

77
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,890
bit of what that looks like what I mean

78
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,030
by that classic point if I want to

79
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,610
decrypt traffic between well just about

80
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,190
anything in Google nowadays I can't

81
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,260
let's plain and simple it's certificate

82
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,120
pinning is involved the apps won't work

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,950
and we see that with a lot of apps out

84
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,720
there which now means things like trying

85
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,970
to do traffic inspection for data loss

86
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,010
prevention goes out the window I can't

87
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:29,459
do it

88
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,200
it means trying to look for embedded

89
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,750
threats I can't do it all that ends up

90
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,140
happening is there's a session going on

91
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,590
that I can't do any of no she a ssin in

92
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,660
a quick question on the room how

93
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,810
familiar is this room with how

94
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,799
decryption works how SSL decryption

95
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,060
works ok only about 1/3 so I'm just

96
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,850
gonna I'm gonna do a simple version of

97
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,459
it basically the way you do SSL

98
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,239
decryption is a man-in-the-middle attack

99
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,250
right so it's real simple if I own the

100
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,989
keys write someone's car trying to come

101
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:05,989
into my environment I own the

102
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:08,549
certificates I can decrypt that traffic

103
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:09,870
very easily right because they're coming

104
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,910
against my servers but if my users are

105
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,290
trying to go out to the Internet

106
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,090
traditionally what I'd have to do is I'd

107
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,040
have to proxy that session I'd have to

108
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,040
capture the certificate re-sign it so

109
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,988
essentially the user is signing an

110
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:24,599
encrypted session with me and then I

111
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,099
retransmit that traffic on the other

112
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,200
side the other way

113
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,180
but what ends up happening of course is

114
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,700
the user is getting a cert that doesn't

115
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,940
say it's from facebook.com so their

116
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,440
browser should technically throw out an

117
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,630
error message say oh wait you've gone to

118
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,610
Facebook but that server is will Young's

119
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,180
hack Netcom not gonna work

120
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,010
of course most users just sort of ignore

121
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,490
that anyways and it worked fine but you

122
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,290
set up an internal certificate authority

123
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,510
you can make it look good but really

124
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,670
it's still just hacking them yes the

125
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,030
cell session so we needed to find a way

126
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,670
to get past that and thus folks do

127
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,680
things like certificate pinning which is

128
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,620
essentially like a self-signed cert for

129
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,440
doing the key exchange where it's I on

130
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,330
both ends of the devices I can handle

131
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,580
and manage that sort of trusted

132
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,760
negotiation between them it breaks that

133
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,750
man in the middle of the tack add to

134
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,390
that we're seeing a lot more well really

135
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,860
a lot more in coding right with things

136
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,890
like HTTP - we're now being encrypted

137
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,740
with TLS we're looking at binary format

138
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,300
information that becomes a lot harder to

139
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,770
be able to manage a lot harder for me to

140
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,310
rip open and another example you know

141
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,960
Google their own variation on

142
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,210
certificate pinning just as a way to be

143
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,220
able to say I've got client-server

144
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,570
communication that I'm not going to be

145
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,450
able to look at now as an exploiter I

146
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,210
love this right because I don't even

147
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,040
have to start embedding my own

148
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,720
encryption technology inside of it I'll

149
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,430
just leverage the infrastructure that's

150
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,260
out there right I'm going to attack a

151
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,390
server well I'm just going to attack it

152
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,900
over HTTPS or TLS and and everything is

153
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,970
going to be delivered from an exploit

154
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,800
perspective in same thing for data

155
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,380
leakage and whatnot so I need to find

156
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,590
other ways around this now what I

157
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,870
encounter a lot with my customers is

158
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,370
well we want to do this in the firewall

159
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,500
right makes sense we've got something in

160
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,360
the middle and we can there's a lot that

161
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,220
can happen there the idea is very simple

162
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,090
right I have a SSL policy that's going

163
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,710
to maintain some rules about how I

164
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,100
handle SSL and TLS traffic and then once

165
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,960
I've made those appropriate decisions

166
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,760
I'm going to either decide what to

167
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,680
decrypt or I'm going to go on to doing

168
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,000
some additional inspection for

169
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,160
application control for intrusion

170
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,969
prevention where I'm

171
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:44,869
looking for threats and hopefully I'll

172
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:46,939
be able to get into it the challenge is

173
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,729
I can't always so I need to start

174
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:51,319
looking for other markers the

175
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,759
traditional thinking of just saying oh

176
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,349
well we're gonna decrypt the traffic

177
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:56,629
it's kind of nice but frankly it's

178
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:59,269
computationally expensive I don't always

179
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:01,249
have control over the certs and it

180
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:03,319
breaks trusted infrastructure in a way

181
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,809
that users suddenly still don't work

182
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:07,909
well with it and many applications start

183
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:11,349
to fail so let's check other things

184
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:14,209
there's other artifacts around encrypted

185
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:16,489
traffic that we can try to leverage and

186
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:18,709
so you want your next-gen firewall to be

187
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,449
able to look at something like a TLS

188
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:22,849
client-server negotiation and pull out

189
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:27,769
things like the domain name right so

190
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:29,959
here's the question am i actually

191
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,369
decrypting traffic in something like

192
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:34,339
this that's right I'm not all I'm really

193
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:38,869
doing is enforcing domain access right

194
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:41,569
so I might be able to say okay there's a

195
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:44,029
certificate coming in from example

196
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:47,599
dotnet I can see that from the the sni

197
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,269
on the cert and try to be able to decide

198
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,399
what I want to be able to to allow or

199
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,229
not allow so really making an access

200
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:56,929
control decision on based on a label and

201
00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:58,909
that's fine that's not a bad thing but

202
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:00,409
it's not helping me see the embedded

203
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:05,209
attack it's even worse than 1.3 because

204
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:06,909
now I'm getting more of that information

205
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:09,679
encrypted right so that server name the

206
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:11,689
actual server information is actually

207
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:14,719
diffie-hellman encrypted NAT - so it's

208
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:18,399
getting harder everyone with me so far

209
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:23,959
ok good well assuming I can you know the

210
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:26,119
traditional thinking was always if we

211
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:28,099
can decrypt it let's let's decrypt it

212
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:30,079
let's look for threats but really I'm

213
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,750
now just in a threat mitigation so I

214
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,729
want to at least be able to control what

215
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:36,409
I can control or not and that maybe by

216
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,599
domain information may also be by

217
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,558
structure right so instead of just dupes

218
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:44,449
which button did I hit I want the green

219
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:45,860
one hey there we go

220
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,279
so what I can do is make decisions on

221
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,160
the traffic whether it's in line and I'm

222
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,740
trying to do some certificate inspection

223
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,620
or I'm working passively ultimately the

224
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,600
goal is to try to figure out some

225
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,360
conditions around that cert traffic that

226
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,510
I want to be able to make a security

227
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,720
control decision on it right and it may

228
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,100
be doing things like we've done before

229
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,130
where we capture the sir riri sign we

230
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,260
act as that man in the middle only

231
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,060
replaces the key but of course the user

232
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,460
sees it the applications break those are

233
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,130
data points though right and I can also

234
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,920
leverage data points like the sites that

235
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,870
are decrypt Abul and under cryptical do

236
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,880
I actually want to allow users to go to

237
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,740
organizations that I can't decrypt on

238
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,050
and that may be appropriate for some

239
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,080
parts of my traffic certainly if it's an

240
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,670
inbound session coming to one of my in

241
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,950
my assets and I can't decrypt the

242
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,750
traffic I've decided I'm going to allow

243
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,790
that type of decryption maybe I don't

244
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,470
allow that session to ever establish in

245
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,310
the first place

246
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,410
makes sense because in a scenario like

247
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,910
that maybe an attacker using a

248
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,410
self-signed key on some malware

249
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,510
distribution that they've deployed that

250
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,240
makes sense to control that and we found

251
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,090
that right now putting controls on

252
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,670
things like self signed keys improperly

253
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,010
formatted keys improperly formatted

254
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,920
certificate matches or ways to reduce

255
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,860
threat exposure and they can reduce

256
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,890
their exposure fairly dramatically just

257
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,710
because the attacking landscape is still

258
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,330
using a lot of self-signed cert or

259
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,140
they're using certificate authorities

260
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,050
that are frankly not there's not the

261
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,640
best certificate authorities in the

262
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:33,620
world big things to look for excluding

263
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,780
self-signed cert looking for errors

264
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,510
looking for miss communications looking

265
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,010
for anything in the structure of how

266
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,560
that communication establishes to try to

267
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,230
be able to control essentially all I'm

268
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,150
doing now is implementing an access

269
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,830
control on the structure of the policy

270
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,270
or on the structure of that

271
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,310
communication not really getting

272
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,230
embedded in the content and I'm not

273
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,140
really looking at threat and all this is

274
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,510
doing is just validating that it's good

275
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,750
content and it does help but I want to

276
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,400
be able to get deeper than that right I

277
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,470
don't want to just block sort of

278
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,600
indiscriminately on things that may

279
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,540
still be valid sessions or things that

280
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,220
aren't actually threaten abled so if I'm

281
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,990
gonna do this I need to have a better

282
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,480
way right I can't just go through and

283
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,190
try to look at things like you know the

284
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,550
actions to take on any specific type of

285
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,269
SSL or TLS session I actually want to

286
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:31,699
build something a little bit richer now

287
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:35,149
one way to think of this this is to

288
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:37,279
actually offload it so one of the huge

289
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,199
challenges we've had with decryption is

290
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,509
cost and how many organizations here

291
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:43,790
actually try to do SSL decrypt on their

292
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:49,329
traffic anyone one hand that's awesome

293
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:52,459
that's actually not surprising at all

294
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:55,120
in fact I was almost expecting I was

295
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,649
only I think I mean to get at least

296
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:59,779
three or four big reason I find is that

297
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:02,389
it's just too bloody expensive to do

298
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,180
effective SSL decrypt is costly and and

299
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,040
as you saw I've got to start making all

300
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,660
these decisions on what the structure

301
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,339
that traffic looks like in order to

302
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:12,829
become effective at it so one thing

303
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:14,360
we've started seeing happen is I'll

304
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,759
offload it to the cloud so we've we've

305
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,199
been doing this at Cisco with some of

306
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:20,389
our customers and and actually creating

307
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:23,360
a an environment where we will allow

308
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,069
customers be able to get their ssl

309
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:28,069
decrypt offloaded into an external sort

310
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:30,410
of security service gateway right the

311
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,870
idea is proxy traffic out with one

312
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,880
particular direction whether it's web

313
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,040
traffic or whether it's all traffic you

314
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,630
make decisions on that and you rely on

315
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,009
your service provider to make

316
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,139
intelligent informed decisions on what

317
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:44,300
to decrypt and what to encrypt or what

318
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,490
to leave alone or at least to put threat

319
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,709
information on but really all I'm doing

320
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:50,209
is sort of offloading that management of

321
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:52,130
it and hoping to reduce cost at scale

322
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,230
I'm not really getting into the

323
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:59,660
structure of what threat may be so if I

324
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,040
can't do decryption what else can I be

325
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,550
left with well the way I look at it is I

326
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,100
need better threat intelligence all

327
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,540
right and a big part of what we're

328
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,329
finding is that we have a massive amount

329
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:16,519
of data available to us globally around

330
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,260
what threat actors look like what

331
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,730
they're doing how they behave and how

332
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,750
how information

333
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,700
sort of works there are artifacts and

334
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,700
indicators that we can use to be able to

335
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,400
say with confidence this is a session

336
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,830
that I would not want to allow even

337
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,710
without doing decryption right and I'm

338
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,960
an old IPS guy I like to be able to look

339
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,430
at the packets I'd like to be able to

340
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,320
sort of do a raw decode and be able to

341
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,510
say explicitly this is where the threat

342
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,670
is inside the code but it's too

343
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,310
expensive to do that so instead I want

344
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,440
to start correlating observations from

345
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,720
external sources and behaviors on my

346
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,640
internal environment in a way that

347
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,410
starts to bring data together so I can

348
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,960
point confidently at session activity

349
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:04,350
that may be threatened embedded so where

350
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,510
do I start well the easy things are

351
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,300
things like IP addresses IP reputation

352
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,970
URL reputation with assuming of course I

353
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,810
can get the URL but all of these become

354
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,760
elements and factors in allowing what is

355
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,620
and should should and should not be

356
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,750
connected to domain name requests is

357
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,880
another big one and so we've started

358
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,730
finding that if we track things like the

359
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,410
reputation around specific domain names

360
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,230
and not just you know your average

361
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,490
facebook.com domain names but the

362
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,690
domains names that are being generated

363
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,120
algorithmically you know we see domain

364
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,380
name generation happening very rapidly

365
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,030
we'll see new domains pop up within 20

366
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,040
minutes the entire internet can access

367
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,320
them well is that a good domain or not

368
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,760
and if it's constantly rolling new

369
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,860
domains to the same IP addresses that's

370
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,839
potentially at threat actor or a video

371
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,470
streaming service which is kind of a

372
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:01,020
threat actor but those become artifacts

373
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,120
that I want to leverage so how am I

374
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,040
gonna do that let's start taking a look

375
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,490
into that oh the other point to think of

376
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,970
is vulnerability information so I'll get

377
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,250
a little bit more in depth on the the

378
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,190
nature of where how we start pulling all

379
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,230
the the threat intelligence together but

380
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,490
the other thing to keep in mind is just

381
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,350
the nature of vulnerability right we

382
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,020
know actually a lot about what's getting

383
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,220
compromised and how things get

384
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,890
compromised and that also means we can

385
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,150
start seeing and understanding what

386
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,500
those artifacts look like under

387
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,570
different stateful conditions so it

388
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,449
doesn't mean just because I know

389
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:37,549
how an exploit works in sort of the

390
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:39,049
old-fashioned way of looking for an

391
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:40,790
attack on an intrusion prevention system

392
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,929
I'm going to look for this session

393
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:43,189
connection request I'm going to look for

394
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:45,109
this buffer overflow instruction and I'm

395
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:46,759
gonna say that packets the bad packet

396
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:49,160
and actually find characteristics in a

397
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,509
larger session behavior whether it's

398
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:52,369
domain information whether it's file

399
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:55,069
transmission sizes whether it's actually

400
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:57,790
a packet structure of encrypted traffic

401
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,679
so we use this data as well to try to

402
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:04,819
analyze it so how is that gonna happen

403
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:07,309
all right I need to find threat in an

404
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:09,259
encrypted traffic session well I

405
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,989
leverage massive data analytics and

406
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:13,369
that's actually part of what we do now

407
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:15,169
one of the things that cisco has been

408
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:17,149
developing that's something we call

409
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:19,519
encrypted traffic analytics this is

410
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,379
where we're actually doing massive

411
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:24,230
analysis on all of your SSL traffic

412
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:29,449
activity in conjunction with web proxy

413
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:31,699
data in conjunction with enriched

414
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:35,029
NetFlow data that we can identify with a

415
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:38,179
high degree of confidence where there's

416
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:40,309
malware or there's crypto mining where

417
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:42,259
there's malicious content embedded in

418
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:46,609
the HTTP traffic and that's all through

419
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:49,939
data analytics I see the idea is what

420
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:52,730
we're looking at is pulling in enriched

421
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,879
data largely through net flow but we use

422
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:58,730
that data in real time against a much

423
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,980
larger data environment that's been

424
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,329
running analytics against what

425
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:04,130
exploitation behavior looks like on the

426
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,549
Internet alright and so with that we

427
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:10,549
start to put together a mathematical way

428
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:13,519
of determining where I've got malicious

429
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,819
content really all it takes is two

430
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:19,250
elements I need the initial data packet

431
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,419
and I need net flow and so I get a

432
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:25,429
massive amount of net flow coming into

433
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:29,029
my analysis engine and then we look at

434
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:31,250
that initial data packet which may give

435
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,539
us information about the structure of

436
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:35,210
the SSL TLS traffic it may also give us

437
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,159
information about really what the size

438
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:38,149
of the session is going to look like

439
00:17:38,149 --> 00:17:39,799
what the behavior of that particular

440
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:42,649
content how it is established and what

441
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:45,260
we have found is that we get a 99%

442
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,809
degree of accuracy in finding threat

443
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:49,490
inside of the traffic

444
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,750
now we can't tell you things like what

445
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,090
data is being stolen how that threat

446
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,880
necessarily exploited your your specific

447
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,560
environment those artifacts aren't

448
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,820
available to us because we're not

449
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,430
decrypting but we are actually able to

450
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,070
point to it this is a massive amount of

451
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,900
data analytics that starts to bring

452
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,920
information together all right all by

453
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,970
using more data it's leveraging the

454
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,680
information that I know about the inside

455
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,300
of my environment that we can see about

456
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,460
how your internal behavior applies and

457
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,230
comparing that in real-time with the

458
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,610
threat landscape now the other way to

459
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,740
look at this is to just turn inward

460
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,160
right I can't look at the traffic maybe

461
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,070
I need to go back to looking at my hosts

462
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,630
and that's where things like Network

463
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,490
behavioral analysis becomes important

464
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,380
again any folks do any heavy net flow

465
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,870
analysis or n/bar functionality inside

466
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,780
your network well if not you may want to

467
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,010
consider it right one of the biggest

468
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,680
indicators for compromise the biggest

469
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,970
indicators for problems in my

470
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,090
environment is something changed and and

471
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,490
it changed outside of my expectation of

472
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,430
what I consider a whitelist now with

473
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,430
better end bar tools what I can actually

474
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,810
start doing is monitoring for those

475
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,790
change realistically and it used to be

476
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,380
very easy to say there's just too many

477
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,940
things every single workstation every

478
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,170
single device on my network is

479
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,000
constantly under some state of change

480
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,970
but it actually with better data richer

481
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,740
data and better analytics I can actually

482
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,510
start analyzing that information in real

483
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,760
time and automate the analysis of it and

484
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,830
look for behavioral characteristics that

485
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,290
are outside the norm that might be

486
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,090
something as simple as a device is

487
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:33,300
suddenly spewing out new services new

488
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,190
network services that's never occurred

489
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,100
or I've got HVAC systems talking to a

490
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,270
foreign country that they've never

491
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,870
talked to so that the behaviour can be

492
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,940
pretty broad but I want to start looking

493
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,680
for those behavioral indicators that

494
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,330
show that there's a potential problem

495
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,610
show that I may be interacting as a

496
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,170
command and control environment show

497
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,390
that I suddenly have session activity

498
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,160
that's outside of the norm for the

499
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,940
behaviors on sort of a macroscopic scale

500
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,710
for that particular environment those

501
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,330
change indicators are

502
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,700
usually indicative of a problem

503
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,290
sometimes it's IT more often than not

504
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,080
it's actually security all right some

505
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,670
type of threat scenarios embedded inside

506
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,790
of that I also want better host

507
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,830
investigation right down to the details

508
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,570
so that actually means being able to

509
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,340
profile the behaviors of that specific

510
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,800
device down to things like identity

511
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,380
what's the configuration of the device

512
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,820
what is the overall flow and behavioral

513
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,740
characteristics around that device the

514
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,420
more I can know about the endpoints that

515
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,800
are actually interacting with them and

516
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,540
sort of put a fence around those

517
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,000
components the less I'm actually worried

518
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,770
about encrypted conditions make sense so

519
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,580
now I've talked a little bit about

520
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,910
monitoring the change cloud yeah I don't

521
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,200
like that title I think I might have to

522
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,440
change that one but what I'm really

523
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,060
getting to is you're noticing we're

524
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,680
talking about a lot of data right and

525
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,630
it's not like I can just stand up a

526
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,010
server and say okay this is going to be

527
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,780
my data analytics box and set my network

528
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,900
I need to find ways to be able to start

529
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,520
bringing all of this data together and

530
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,210
tying the pieces together and so am I

531
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,940
really looking at just threat embedded

532
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,710
in traffic am I trying to understand

533
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,750
what reputation information is from IP

534
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,530
addresses

535
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,450
need to start understanding what host

536
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,370
endpoint configuration and change looks

537
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,220
like we can use the cloud as a way to

538
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,890
help deliver some of that one of the

539
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,960
easiest and simplest is just leveraging

540
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,690
domain name services we one of the

541
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,400
things that we'll do is we'll help and

542
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,160
monitor DNS calls and lookups

543
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,620
because one of the things that I can

544
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,500
prevent is infection and compromise just

545
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,780
by disallowing a connection to happen

546
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,970
remember domain name services are

547
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,350
essentially the yellow pages

548
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:51,240
does anyone remember yellow pages or

549
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,030
white pages and I don't mean that calm

550
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,980
or dot CA versions of them that are just

551
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,370
ad engines man I missed the yellow pages

552
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:04,250
are some things I want analog back well

553
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:08,040
what we do here and what the what we've

554
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,230
been trying to build with say Cisco's

555
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,570
umbrella solution is a way to be able to

556
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,870
look at DNS in real time as it's being

557
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,860
propagated

558
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,340
so this also means watching how new

559
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,740
domains get generated what's being built

560
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,899
out there and building massive models

561
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:28,289
around threat intelligence on IP and

562
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:30,480
known malware that we're seeing from

563
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,000
other other agents of information and

564
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,010
being able associate that with domains

565
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,049
as they're being generated and not just

566
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:40,260
you know little facebook.com/ ones but

567
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,120
actually fairly complex domain names

568
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,519
we've got scientists who work on whole

569
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:46,470
new methods of domain name generation

570
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,440
prediction but all of that means now

571
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,750
when my device has given some malicious

572
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,789
URL and goes out and calls it I know how

573
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,769
old that URL is I know how many other

574
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:57,149
artifacts have gone to it I know who

575
00:22:57,149 --> 00:22:59,130
else is asking for it I know if there's

576
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,600
malware associated with it

577
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
am I gonna allow it to be connected to

578
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,950
probably not I'm gonna actually sit come

579
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,049
back and give you a different IP address

580
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:09,090
for that domain request and say yeah you

581
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,090
don't want to go there right it's very

582
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:15,450
simple to do user makes is given a URL

583
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,070
they're given a domain they make a

584
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,679
request all we have to do is be the

585
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,769
authoritative response and it propagates

586
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:24,690
very quickly requires no physical

587
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,029
infrastructure it's very fast it's a

588
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:29,010
preventative method it's not actually

589
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,470
getting into the encrypted traffic all

590
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,059
it's doing is saying look these are

591
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,100
domains that we know are potentially bad

592
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,100
that we know are malicious and I may

593
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,269
have actually received that over an

594
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:40,799
encrypted session because you know

595
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,730
attackers are using HTTPS now but what I

596
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,370
can also do is use that to leverage how

597
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,429
I might handle the traffic differently

598
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:53,240
so for example I used to run DNS our

599
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,330
HTTP I said that again it's my morning -

600
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,669
I used to run SSL decryption inside of

601
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:01,830
my own Network environment now I say my

602
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,809
network environment I really just host a

603
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,039
network of about a hundred and fifty

604
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,139
devices that are owned and run by the

605
00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:09,090
five people who live in my household I

606
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,279
have three teenage daughters so we have

607
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,919
a lot of IP information but I did want

608
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:20,220
to decrypt some of that and I didn't

609
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,389
want to have to continue running it

610
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:22,889
inside of my house I actually found that

611
00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:24,600
when I was running the SSL engine my

612
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,360
electric bill went up by three percent

613
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,710
it was just that much more computational

614
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,850
effort was going on in the box

615
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,710
so what we did instead was ice decided

616
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,410
to proxy based on DNS right so now what

617
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,390
happens is on specific DNS requests if

618
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,280
it's potentially malicious I'll have

619
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,500
that session do so and it scales fairly

620
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,930
quickly because all of my users all of

621
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,600
my devices trust this particular DNS

622
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,490
provider as an authoritative entity and

623
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,680
they've got the certificates embedded

624
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,510
inside it to be able to allow that so

625
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,130
they've got a trusted CA path that I'm

626
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,290
part of and there can be that man in the

627
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,630
middle of the attack at least for things

628
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,750
that are easily decrypted so they can at

629
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,030
least send that traffic off to some

630
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,640
other AV engine some other tool but the

631
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,560
key one I think's really important here

632
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,750
is the file inspection because instead

633
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,400
of just doing traffic redirection I need

634
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,080
to look at content that's coming down as

635
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,330
well I'm gonna get to that one in just a

636
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:21,930
moment but the if I at least know which

637
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,940
and where I can start trying to capture

638
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,590
that malicious content before it comes

639
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,600
into my environment if it's even going

640
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,940
to be allowed and the real decision is

641
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,460
simple or is a little bit greater than

642
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,500
that I mean is if I know it's bad

643
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,700
obviously I'm not gonna allow them to

644
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,830
connect right and if I've got a high

645
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,180
degree of confidence it's good I'll have

646
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,310
the sessions to happen it's the things

647
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,290
in the middle the things we don't know

648
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,840
we don't fully know about that domain we

649
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,490
don't fully know about that session

650
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,960
that's where we're gonna want to send

651
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,150
the traffic off to some type of file

652
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,220
analytics assuming I can decrypt the

653
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,460
session if I can't I'm gonna have to

654
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,110
come and deal with another place right

655
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,670
because I'm not always going to be able

656
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,620
to deal with it on the wire or over the

657
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,290
Internet at some point I'm going to need

658
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,420
to be able to take that information

659
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:10,260
bring it down to an actual sandbox now

660
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,430
if I'm lucky and I've been able to

661
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,990
decrypt the session I'll take the file

662
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,790
and I'll throw it into a sandbox where

663
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,110
we take advantage of something like

664
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,080
threat grid to be able to do full file

665
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,270
investigation look at that file object

666
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:21,930
tear it apart

667
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,060
start ripping out the artifacts and this

668
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,770
is actually how we start building out a

669
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:28,230
lot of the intelligence around malicious

670
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,900
domain names around malicious IPs and if

671
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,640
I've got a file object that I can sort

672
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,770
of explode and let execute in a safe

673
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,810
environment I'm not trying to just

674
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,940
identify that it's malware I'm trying to

675
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,410
be able to identify what's it's it's

676
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,330
secure communication practices look like

677
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,110
and

678
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,030
of it to Mayan throat my encrypted

679
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:48,330
threat analytics team I'm trying to pull

680
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,130
out the artifacts for known malicious

681
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:50,910
IPs

682
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,410
I'm trying to understand how it does

683
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,510
domain name generation so that I can

684
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,710
actually try to replicate that

685
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,809
computational capability inside my own

686
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:00,090
analysis I'm looking for endpoint

687
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,920
artifacts things that are being changed

688
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,690
in registry keys files that are being

689
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,970
modified system calls that are occurring

690
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,370
all of that becomes data that we can

691
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:11,340
leverage in other platforms to be able

692
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,049
to look for Exploited information and

693
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:14,910
maybe it's from that file I was able to

694
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:20,880
decrypt what that does do is it gives me

695
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,350
some scale right I'm no longer looking

696
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,059
at just having to do this at a single

697
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,370
point a sort of choke point inside my

698
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,110
environment I can offload some of the

699
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,440
compute I can spread it around

700
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,780
but scale is not enough all right

701
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,160
because it's still gonna get in

702
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,790
I still have encrypted stuff it's still

703
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,110
too expensive to fully decrypt

704
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,970
everything I still can't get rid of

705
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,580
everything so what's that leave me I've

706
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,049
got to put more security functionality

707
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:48,840
inside the end point right because they

708
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,340
ultimately that's the game that's what

709
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,780
the attackers are going after we all

710
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,750
want to get access to that end device

711
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,230
and control that because that's my way

712
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,549
into your organization that's the way

713
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:02,370
into my your data set so I'm gonna go

714
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,870
after that in any way I can whether it's

715
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,970
an IOT component like a web camera which

716
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,580
are the easy ones or whether it's my

717
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,250
employees who are sitting in the local

718
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,169
Tim Hortons those are the super easy

719
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:16,040
ones those are the really easy ones back

720
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,890
so I need better endpoint controls you

721
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,020
know I've got some of our products up

722
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,940
there I'm not gonna focus on the

723
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,980
products themselves and focus on the

724
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,230
capabilities around that right what is

725
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,360
it I want well I want some way to be

726
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,549
able to on the endpoint know what the

727
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:35,070
device is I need to know its posture and

728
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,440
its profile how is it configured what's

729
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,809
it doing who's using it so I need a good

730
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:41,880
sense of identity that I can have a high

731
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,980
degree of assurance on I need to wait a

732
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,990
way to be able to understand how its

733
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,030
interacting with the Internet regardless

734
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,590
of whether it's on my network or not and

735
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:52,290
enforce that policy regardless of where

736
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,720
it is it's something that allows me to

737
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,909
be able to track its DNS activity

738
00:28:56,909 --> 00:28:58,470
capture that information ensure that it

739
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,690
goes to a trusted component and I need

740
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,029
to have visibility into the actual file

741
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:04,919
system into the system calls into the

742
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,409
process execution activity that's going

743
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:09,749
on inside of it because that's where I

744
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:11,309
can start monitoring for change and

745
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:12,960
where I can start leveraging controls

746
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,479
none of those are encrypted right those

747
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:17,700
are all things that have clear simple

748
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,830
signature components on that I can start

749
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,809
putting additional degrees of assurance

750
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:23,669
on all right so if it's a trusted asset

751
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:26,190
with a known user that has the right

752
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,859
protections on it then maybe I'm gonna

753
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:30,509
start allowing this really all I'm

754
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:32,369
trying to do is raise the access control

755
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:34,169
bar but it's also giving me good

756
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:35,460
intelligence about the types of data

757
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,950
that may be occurring inside the device

758
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,279
itself all right I need to be able to do

759
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,729
this on or off premise all right and so

760
00:29:43,729 --> 00:29:47,099
this actually expands a lot more than

761
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:49,169
just saying oh I want a VPN back into my

762
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:52,710
network in fact I think we've got duo

763
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,220
speaking later today is that right I

764
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:59,220
don't remember is you guys no no okay

765
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,840
I'd heard that they may be here so I

766
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,609
didn't know the only reason I mentioned

767
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:05,009
that is because that's another tool for

768
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:06,450
doing not just multi-factor

769
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,309
authentication but identity awareness

770
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:11,190
right so a big trend in sort of handling

771
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,799
and managing how we deal with threat was

772
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,450
to say oh well we'll just run everyone

773
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,039
back into our enterprise through good

774
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,489
VPN which is really just saying okay I'm

775
00:30:20,489 --> 00:30:21,989
going to encrypt the traffic end of my

776
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:24,059
network so they can go out over an

777
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,979
encrypted tunnel to an attacker who's

778
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:27,989
going to bring it into there it's really

779
00:30:27,989 --> 00:30:29,309
just creating a longer path for the

780
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:32,399
attack chain right but the attack still

781
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,559
occurs so I need to be able to not VPN

782
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,509
isn't really the answer all that does is

783
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:41,879
say here's that what we consider a going

784
00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:43,679
to quote trusted path to application

785
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,239
services that I may want to deliver I

786
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:47,940
don't actually need that what I need is

787
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,369
strong assurance I need to know who the

788
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:51,779
identity is I need to know what the

789
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:53,729
configuration and that component is need

790
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:54,960
to be able to tile all those things

791
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,809
together to be able to allow access

792
00:30:56,809 --> 00:30:59,159
technologies like duo allow us to be

793
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:02,309
able to do that duo's a well I'd say

794
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:03,210
it's a multi-factor authentication

795
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,489
solution that Cisco recently acquired

796
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,200
but it's really a lot more than that

797
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,789
it's about being able to identify the

798
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:10,169
posture and configuration

799
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:12,210
I associate that with identity and

800
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,179
associated that with policy in real time

801
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:17,009
right and if I got anything wrong well

802
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,330
if there's a do a guy in the upper and

803
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:22,129
you feel free to shoot me out later so

804
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,090
ultimately that's what I'm looking at

805
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,009
right really just improving access

806
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,659
control but gaining better visibility

807
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:30,739
and we can do that with more than just

808
00:31:30,739 --> 00:31:33,269
the posture we can also do that with the

809
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:35,669
traffic all right good endpoint

810
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:37,919
intelligence why not give me a net flow

811
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,960
right allow me to actually be able to

812
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,029
see session activity tie session

813
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:45,480
activity to a specific process and so

814
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,710
that when I see for any particular

815
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,899
Network file characteristics I know

816
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:50,850
which process associated that I know

817
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,559
which user is associated with it I know

818
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,869
which device was associated with it and

819
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:56,460
so bringing all of this together so

820
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,960
that's actually one of the things we

821
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,340
started trying to do inside of any

822
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,200
connect is run a network visibility

823
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,059
module that allows me to see that

824
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:05,639
devices behavior regardless of where it

825
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:07,200
is on the internet whether it's on my

826
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,119
network or outside and be able to

827
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:12,600
capture that type of net flow

828
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,639
information and intelligence about that

829
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:18,659
particular component and I leverage

830
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:20,279
something like advanced malware analysis

831
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:23,309
actually watch the file system watch the

832
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:25,769
memory space watch the process execution

833
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:28,019
behavior watch what those processors are

834
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:30,720
doing in times and spaces in places

835
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,249
where they're not encrypted or where

836
00:32:32,249 --> 00:32:34,919
encryption doesn't matter right it an

837
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,409
encrypted object at rest that is known

838
00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:40,230
malicious you know it's still known we

839
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,330
can still fingerprint that object for

840
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,679
the state that it's in and try to

841
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,169
capture it we can monitor file and

842
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:48,749
network intelligence and interactions on

843
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:52,019
a global scale and report that back to a

844
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:54,629
common identifier so that I now have

845
00:32:54,629 --> 00:32:55,739
different ways to be able to look at

846
00:32:55,739 --> 00:32:57,809
that same object from multiple

847
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,820
perspectives think about this for a

848
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,769
second if I've got a malware analysis

849
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:04,590
tool watching behavior process level

850
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,359
behavior on my endpoint that I can

851
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,429
associate with Network intelligence

852
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:11,009
information and say oh there's something

853
00:33:11,009 --> 00:33:13,679
unusual here my network behavioral

854
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,090
analytics is saying there's something

855
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,629
unusual here and suddenly I've got a

856
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,519
whole bunch of domain requests to things

857
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:23,730
that are unknown and unusual

858
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:26,910
that particular device that starts to

859
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,350
raise the level of concern around it

860
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,810
right I'm seeing behavioral changes from

861
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:31,860
two different directions

862
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,750
maybe I'm lacking identity information

863
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,390
on some of the process activity which

864
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,370
would be a problem because the process

865
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,260
was probably created by a spawn malware

866
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,180
that's generated a new user or a new

867
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,530
identity right I've got things happening

868
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:46,950
that are aren't really kosher for what

869
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,390
that traffic looks like I've got

870
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,950
correlating information coming from the

871
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,080
outside world is this the type of thing

872
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,160
I want to control more than likely yes

873
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,470
all right because the number of unknowns

874
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,350
and sort of data myths that's become a

875
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,420
problem we get that kind of data with

876
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,310
being able to look at everything from

877
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,170
process information file behavior

878
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,570
network i/o compare that with other

879
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:11,880
artifacts and do so on a global scale

880
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,030
with good threat intelligence all right

881
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,340
so that did mean having to build out

882
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,110
larger threat intelligence capability so

883
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,659
I'll talk a moment about that but I need

884
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,630
to make sure I get all of my devices to

885
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,500
and that can be a challenge

886
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,020
right so hey you know there's mobile

887
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,420
device management tools MDM which is

888
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,090
kind of great but MDM kind of depends on

889
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,620
the platform is how it works

890
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,100
right for example these these lovely

891
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,030
pieces of Apple glass are notoriously

892
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:44,760
hard to protect for a long time and the

893
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,770
big challenge was just being able to get

894
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,210
deep enough into the system to be able

895
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,699
to control it right to actually be able

896
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,590
to see what's going on because what

897
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,300
would end up happening of course is that

898
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,670
there are applications that are using

899
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,380
their own custom tools for certificate

900
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,420
pinning for other behaviors they've got

901
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,760
their own sort of proxy they've got

902
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,920
their own sort of VPN I've got really no

903
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,410
control of how they were handling DNS so

904
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,780
I needed to get better at that when the

905
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,910
idea was deep process integration right

906
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,740
now we've been able to do things like

907
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,170
this on other platforms like Android and

908
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,120
whatnot but really when I'm looking at

909
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,040
mobile device management I need to look

910
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,170
at this regardless of the platform which

911
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,310
means I need to be able to control

912
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,220
things like domain name service requests

913
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,140
right I can't just let anyone provide

914
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,090
that I need you have policy around it I

915
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,770
need to be able to identify the the

916
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:33,870
component that does so I need to be able

917
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,870
to see every single process that exists

918
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:37,440
or Apple

919
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,930
that exists on the device I need to

920
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,130
actually be able to identify the

921
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:44,430
identity of things that of the people

922
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,660
that are interacting with those

923
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,150
components and most importantly I have

924
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,800
to have it be entirely invisible to the

925
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,230
user they can't actually have the

926
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:55,170
experience of okay I need a VPN into

927
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,480
this thing because do going over here to

928
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,830
VPN to the company they would be able to

929
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:01,200
get my mail that's a hassle right

930
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,000
they're not gonna end up doing it

931
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,290
they're gonna find workarounds or worse

932
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,820
yet it's going to destroy the

933
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,050
performance of their device and they're

934
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,610
going to be even grumpier we don't want

935
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,980
to be in the way we've had that problem

936
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:15,360
too much in security already so by

937
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,600
integrating good MDM all the way down to

938
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,450
the process level and I'm gonna really

939
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,980
not say MDM any more because I don't

940
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,450
like it I want something that's really

941
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,610
more of a security connector I want

942
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,500
something that's actually as close to

943
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,120
ring zero as possible that allows me to

944
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,950
be able to identify the devices get full

945
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,860
posture negotiate and manage how domain

946
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,300
interactions are occurring or DNS

947
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,370
interactions are occurring and be able

948
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,710
to capture that same sort of process

949
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,200
level and file IO and Network IO

950
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:50,490
behavior happening on any device so how

951
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:54,120
do I put it all together the big way is

952
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,390
really intelligence so what we found is

953
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,130
we can have a lot of different security

954
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:02,100
tools we can have firewalls that are

955
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,720
doing application visibility and control

956
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,390
we can do intrusion prevention but you

957
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:11,070
know they get killed by encryption

958
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,320
traffic we can do domain name monitoring

959
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,700
IP reputation URL rotation they get

960
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,610
killed by and cut the traffic so I

961
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,830
really have to start looking at all the

962
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,240
artifacts that are associated around

963
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,460
this behaviors and that's where good

964
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,770
threat intelligence comes in and and

965
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,780
there's plenty of folks that do a wide

966
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,120
range of threat intelligence we focus of

967
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,190
course a lot on the Talos threat

968
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,650
intelligence group at Cisco largely

969
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,600
because of the size and sort of breadth

970
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,700
of information that they have but it's

971
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,650
been able to be a fantastic resource and

972
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,030
doing a lot of the research around what

973
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,180
we're trying to accomplish

974
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,820
we actually have the luxury of having

975
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,380
the largest threat intelligence sort of

976
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,600
privately held threat intelligence group

977
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,850
in the world now and that gives us the

978
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,650
opportunity to see what exploitation

979
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,630
looks like on the order of billions of

980
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:02,150
sessions a day and so we're seeing

981
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,490
hundreds of millions of threats probably

982
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,950
every day we were doing a computational

983
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,290
analysis on anywhere for 1.5 to 2

984
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,700
million pieces of malware

985
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,350
we're being able to pull in and see

986
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,850
intelligence about how domains are being

987
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,470
generated and how the interact internet

988
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,990
is actually interacting with itself if

989
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,360
customers providing telemetry off of

990
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,070
malware and file execution behavior

991
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,440
inside their own environments all of

992
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,390
which get sanitized and we can start to

993
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,400
see that behavioral activity we get

994
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,050
death elegance frankly from our own

995
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,970
company the nice thing about having a

996
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,030
company of 70,000 people with about

997
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:37,340
150,000 to 200,000 devices on it is

998
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,040
there's a lot of internet intelligence

999
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,000
inside of that alone but on a global

1000
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,830
scale when we scale out we start to be

1001
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,330
able to see the trends and problems that

1002
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:51,740
are occur in threat characteristics each

1003
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,030
from different tool sets with different

1004
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,130
sort of perspectives on the visibility

1005
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,630
whether it's being able to look at how

1006
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,820
emails are being built and generated and

1007
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,410
types of malicious URLs that are being

1008
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,970
embedded them and comparing them back

1009
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,070
against other artifacts whether it's

1010
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,920
looking at new IP threat actors and what

1011
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,270
the IP addresses are whether it's

1012
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:11,030
domains etc all of that needs to come

1013
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:14,090
together into a larger architecture all

1014
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,830
right so the idea is that I start

1015
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:18,680
combining the different components from

1016
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,740
cloud intelligence to what I can see and

1017
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,000
work with on the network whether it's

1018
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,220
NetFlow data whether it's IP data

1019
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,640
whether it's decrypted traffic the idea

1020
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,820
now is I get to be smarter and so I

1021
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,570
think the takeaway hopefully is that I

1022
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,880
try to be mindful and you can ignore the

1023
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,620
product names I try to be mindful of the

1024
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,630
capabilities I want to deliver for the

1025
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,040
traffic flow that I'm being trying to

1026
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,500
protect the way I look at it

1027
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,810
architectural II is when I'm trying to

1028
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,610
decide what to do with encrypted traffic

1029
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,470
I can't just bring in a sledgehammer and

1030
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,660
say decrypt it all that's not gonna

1031
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,660
happen and I can't turn off the internet

1032
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,730
so I need to start being mindful of what

1033
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,350
the capability is that's going to be

1034
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,430
most appropriate

1035
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:04,700
for that session and apply the best type

1036
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,730
of capability at that layer all right so

1037
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:10,430
maybe it's doing flow analytics maybe

1038
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:12,950
it's doing okay look at that the buttons

1039
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,470
working maybe it's starting right here

1040
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,580
at the endpoint right trying to actually

1041
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,800
be able to look at what type of malware

1042
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,020
may be landing on it maybe executing may

1043
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,200
exist what are the sort of endpoint

1044
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,390
behaviors then it's going out and doing

1045
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:30,470
recursive DNS trying to identify are any

1046
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,270
of these requests known good known bad

1047
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,160
unknown and make appropriate decisions

1048
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,010
about how we handle that it's about

1049
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:40,280
having good sort of policy and access

1050
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,200
controls where I can start segmenting

1051
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,810
off segments of my environment based on

1052
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,970
the degree of assurance I have an IOT

1053
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,530
infrastructure that I don't have any

1054
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,360
good endpoint operational control or

1055
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,280
visibility into am I gonna give that

1056
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,900
access to the regular part of my network

1057
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,900
hopefully not could I do behavioral

1058
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,290
analysis on IOT components with you know

1059
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,480
things like net flow data

1060
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,850
absolutely I can so I want to make sure

1061
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,830
that that's considered in whatever the

1062
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,540
flow of data is for that particular

1063
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:11,570
device entity component whether it's on

1064
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,940
net or off net and this is just one

1065
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,970
example right it's a it's a flow of a

1066
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:19,880
and employee going to the internet but

1067
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,190
they're gonna have you know encrypted

1068
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,350
sessions or some type of threat

1069
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,270
potentially embedded inside the traffic

1070
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,370
well certainly I can do my network base

1071
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:31,190
now where my geo filtering my IPS my app

1072
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,470
control but ultimately I'm gonna have to

1073
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,030
have some way to make intelligent

1074
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,490
informed decisions whether they're LAN

1075
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:40,310
deployed or cloud deployed really

1076
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,230
doesn't matter think about how you're

1077
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,610
going to get the best scale for making

1078
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,990
the right decisions on the traffic that

1079
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:45,980
you want to be able to control and

1080
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,160
investigate end of the day it's really

1081
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,600
about building a good architecture I

1082
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,070
don't think we're ever gonna really

1083
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,870
solve the encryption problem because we

1084
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:56,210
need it we want it and we can never turn

1085
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,420
it off so hopefully I've woken you up a

1086
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,300
little bit hopefully I haven't bored you

1087
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,100
or rambled on too much we're more than

1088
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,190
happy to talk about what Cisco can do on

1089
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,600
an architectural basis and that's

1090
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,160
actually the role that I provide is I

1091
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,470
look at our customer solutions not just

1092
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,090
to a specific problem or a specific

1093
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:14,910
product but

1094
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,259
how we can bring capabilities across

1095
00:42:16,259 --> 00:42:19,589
across an organization's environment to

1096
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:23,220
ensure more effective threat response

1097
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,820
