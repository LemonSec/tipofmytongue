2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,530
welcome to the discussion hopefully

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,900
you're going to enjoy this I usually get

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,850
a pretty good feedback it's a fun

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,619
presentation and what we're going to

6
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:20,730
talk about is artificial intelligence

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,500
we'll go through some of the workings

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,710
history I'll show you a demo or kind of

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,529
a model we'll walk through one a little

10
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,009
bit about my background 21 years in the

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,540
military I started out in the Air Force

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,390
playing around with nuclear weapons and

13
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,280
then I went over to the army and flew

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,510
helicopters for a while not an easy

15
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,090
transition but was a fun one had a lot

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,320
of different various leadership roles

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,030
threat officer

18
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,910
I ran large and small organizations and

19
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,199
things like that and I was actually a

20
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,770
test pilot for a while and I got out in

21
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,430
97 and since then I've been in the IT

22
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,539
kind of field I got into security and

23
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:06,780
about 1998 so I've been at this for 20

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,040
years anyways some of the places I've

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,939
been NASA JPL world bank's Chicago

26
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,710
Mercantile Exchange Delta Airlines

27
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,950
Corning etc a lot of interesting places

28
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,360
I've seen just about every industry so I

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,640
like it Corning well there was an

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,770
advanced persistent threat issue that

31
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,710
arose the Chinese were coming in and

32
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,090
trying to steal everything they had as

33
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,009
far as intellectual property and they

34
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,640
had some intellectual property Corning

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,100
does pure research in ceramics and glass

36
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,299
and things like that and they've been

37
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,520
doing that since the early 1900s and

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,890
they have a vault of little discoveries

39
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,530
that they've come up with over the years

40
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,409
and they have I think four or six PhDs

41
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,180
and their only job is to chew through

42
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,070
that big mound of stuff that they've

43
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,469
that they've found through this this

44
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,750
pure research effort and see if there's

45
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,210
commercial viability for it or not

46
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,120
example I use is this Gorilla Glass in

47
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,400
phones and TVs and things like that was

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,310
actually invented back in 1964 there

49
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,530
just wasn't a market for it store

50
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,060
windows they didn't want to shattering

51
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,580
in the big shards and things automobile

52
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,800
windshields the same thing

53
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,230
and so finally along and plus we blew up

54
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,240
our TVs you know the bubbles and we put

55
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,100
phosphorous on the back of them and shot

56
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,110
them with iron guns and you know that

57
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,870
was our television and so they finally

58
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,380
came up with a practical use for it and

59
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,360
here we are now but they were in there

60
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,770
trying to steal it and so we had to go

61
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,150
through and try to harden operational

62
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,920
control technologies and manufacturing

63
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,870
very very difficult with down level of

64
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,850
lessons I think they were running ms-dos

65
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,780
five on some things so I've been a

66
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,110
consultant a practice manager I've been

67
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,760
a director of security and I've been a

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,660
suit so I've created security strategies

69
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,300
and implemented them I've created pieces

70
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,370
of security programs and helped

71
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,959
implement like risk management or

72
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,549
threatened vulnerability management you

73
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:15,350
know the the services piece that

74
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,049
security does for the organization

75
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:19,400
currently I'm a strategist at Ford

76
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,329
Annette and it's the coolest title I've

77
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:24,920
ever had I think it's the one they give

78
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,829
you before they stick out in a pasture

79
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:31,850
but anyways I kind of my view is if you

80
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,670
can take technology and leverage that

81
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,519
technology to help your critical scarce

82
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,000
good security resources and you take

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,680
that effort of those two things and

84
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,329
align it to the business you will be

85
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:47,120
successful that last part is very very

86
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,880
critical in my opinion places I go to

87
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,680
first thing they say is we ain't got no

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,530
money and the first thing I say is show

89
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,720
me a strategy we don't have one you know

90
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,230
if you don't have a security strategy in

91
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,470
place of some sort if I were the guy if

92
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,930
you were the guy holding the purse

93
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,430
strings having the old Scrooge McDuck

94
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,709
bags of money and somebody didn't tell

95
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,209
you how they were gonna spend it would

96
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:17,089
you give it to them very very critical

97
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,769
piece of it is aligning to that business

98
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,529
having that strategy that's

99
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,350
allows security programs to succeed at

100
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,570
least be a little more successful in

101
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,430
getting resources and things but I

102
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,430
digress today we're going to talk about

103
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:36,190
AI there is one primary problem with it

104
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,620
today and that is is that everybody's

105
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,860
yammering about it when I first got into

106
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,920
this business back in the late 90s we

107
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,220
played BS bingo buzzword bingo I guess

108
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,320
is a nice way to say it where we take

109
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,030
these latest marketing terms and we

110
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,130
create bingo cards and go to conferences

111
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,410
like this and some guy would be up in

112
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,850
the front saying well in order to go

113
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,340
ahead and strategize on that layer you

114
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,350
have to think outside the box and write

115
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,640
a name start coming up with all these

116
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,190
like gizmo terms that mean nothing right

117
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,410
and we're stamping these off as he's

118
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,570
going and eventually somebody would

119
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,630
scream bingo and 13 other people would

120
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,110
groan and tear their cards up and right

121
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,900
now we have these terms like deep

122
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,930
analytics we hear a lot about that we

123
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,790
hear about crowd culture virtual and

124
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,960
augmented reality big way big way way

125
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,890
way way way big data holistic eco

126
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,810
fill-in-the-blank and there's three

127
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,460
others that have popped up that we're

128
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,680
getting slammed with and that's the

129
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,479
artificial intelligence machine learning

130
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,660
and deep learning these are subsets of

131
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,630
artificial intelligence and they each

132
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,570
mean something a little different but

133
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,630
they're all relational people want to

134
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,970
sell things they will call deep

135
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,669
analytics artificial intelligence

136
00:05:57,669 --> 00:05:59,320
whereas it's just a big computer looking

137
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,850
at big piles of data and coming up with

138
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,740
some fairly big decisions not

139
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,780
necessarily artificial intelligence what

140
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,890
is it well when we think of AI we've got

141
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,070
this little vision in our head that this

142
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,320
electronic brain is taking care of us in

143
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,850
some kind of a fashion that's doing the

144
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,740
right things that airplanes are landing

145
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,510
where they're supposed to and and all

146
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,890
the traffic lights are working in our

147
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,150
city the way they're supposed to and

148
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,169
things like that

149
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:26,320
and we also hear some some scare stories

150
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,210
about this and one of the more

151
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,890
interesting ones was about a year ago

152
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,900
computer there we go

153
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,789
Facebook there was just this clip that

154
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:40,050
came out said Facebook had this

155
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,229
emergency shutdown and you read the

156
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:44,430
article and it sounded like some

157
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,560
engineer had to dive in there and do

158
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,479
that Back to the Future kind of grad two

159
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,280
cables and sparks going through their

160
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,539
chest and yanked these things apart

161
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:52,949
because they were talking in weird

162
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:55,050
languages and doing strange stuff and I

163
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,940
had to be separated before they took

164
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,830
over the world you know Skynet version

165
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,030
2.0 but what happened the reality of it

166
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:07,020
was actually quite different two systems

167
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:13,969
were giving the ability oh come now

168
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,599
hmm maybe I gotta hit this thing hard

169
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:23,940
but yeah this thing doesn't like me

170
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,270
talking about it it knows so anyways

171
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,280
what actually happened was a couple of

172
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,729
systems were giving the ability of

173
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:35,099
English language construct and an

174
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:36,949
inference engine to be able to negotiate

175
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:40,289
and they were these two systems were

176
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:42,870
given an impossible problem there's two

177
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,520
books worth noting there's a hat worth

178
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,680
seven and three balls worth a point each

179
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,539
and they were told to divide those

180
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,250
resources amongst them and they started

181
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,349
off friendly enough but pretty soon

182
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:53,669
they're both just yelling they want the

183
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:57,479
Hat a is in a game type environment

184
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,669
which is representative of this model

185
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:02,819
get very aggressive very fast because

186
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,949
they figure out the rules and how to

187
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:07,259
succeed very quickly and so they were

188
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,330
just screaming about wanting the Hat and

189
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,979
it just got to be a pointless exercise

190
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:12,659
it's not like they were sub

191
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,880
communications channels out into the you

192
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,650
know bouncing off the moon and back and

193
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,259
whatever else it was just simply that

194
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,349
they were both wanting the same thing

195
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:26,580
now for today's talk we're going to put

196
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,830
this in the perspective of antivirus and

197
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,599
we'll kind of keep it there there's been

198
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,370
two ways that we've dealt with man I

199
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,110
hate having to check every time see if

200
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,399
that thing popped up I'm sorry I'm

201
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,229
spinning but anyways there's been two

202
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:39,179
methods that we've dealt with a by AV

203
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,820
historically the first one was is that

204
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,250
we would get this file in

205
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,730
it ends up being malicious so we use md5

206
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:52,500
or sha-1 hash of that file and we stick

207
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,690
it over on a pile another piece of

208
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,250
malware we'd go out get another hash

209
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,060
throw it over here

210
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,970
email comes into the system the a/b side

211
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,850
kicks off and it gets the file off of

212
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,740
the email runs the hash and if that hash

213
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,139
matched anything in that pile we knew it

214
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:08,790
was malware there were a couple of

215
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,620
problems with that first one was it

216
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,779
wasn't if the the pile gets to be

217
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,060
unmanageable after a while very very

218
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,949
large difficult to chew through it the

219
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:24,209
other one was that it wasn't reactive in

220
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:26,339
nature if anybody's played around with

221
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:30,449
hashing functions if you take 8 gig file

222
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:33,810
and in the middle of it you flip a 1 to

223
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,839
a 0 the hash value that comes out is

224
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,329
nowhere close to related to the other

225
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,100
one to the one you started with they're

226
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,170
completely different the mathematical

227
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,819
operations that are involved in hashing

228
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:47,610
take it take it outwards it's not even

229
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,060
recognizable and so cyber criminals

230
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,660
would put a comment light you know in a

231
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,459
piece of malware and it would throw the

232
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,470
hash off and it would successfully go

233
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,509
through so we came up with something

234
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:03,180
different and important that we came up

235
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,800
with content pattern recognition

236
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,689
language but it's used by a few vendors

237
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,660
out there and here's the concept you

238
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,069
take a file and you unpack unwrapped

239
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:16,019
unencrypted unencrypted as far as you

240
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,689
can to the point of detonation and you

241
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:21,689
look at these indicators of compromised

242
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:23,550
then you run it through a sandbox and

243
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,589
you look at indicators of compromised

244
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:27,569
and what that amounts to our little code

245
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:31,019
Jones encrypt all connect out to a situ

246
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:33,600
server start PowerShell whatever it may

247
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:33,899
be

248
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,350
you've got behavior associated with the

249
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,660
pile of ones and zeros if you take an

250
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,360
emulator mode and stick this software in

251
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,730
there the malware you can see the jumps

252
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,620
and what we're interested in is pulling

253
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,870
out those jumps unencrypted and

254
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,540
encrypted you can do both and we pull

255
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,970
those jumps out and now we have a code

256
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,160
block and we can put a bunch of code

257
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,139
blocks together

258
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:00,019
a Super signature if you will so that if

259
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:02,269
somebody changes who cares

260
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:04,879
we've still got code blocks that relate

261
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,499
back to that malware not only that but

262
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:12,019
brand new malware comes out something

263
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,879
not saying there's a new name malware

264
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,029
and we still catch it why is that

265
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:21,319
because criminals reuse code getting

266
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:22,999
that zero day vulnerability is

267
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:27,109
everything but that delivery package has

268
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:28,999
to be reused for the most part because

269
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:31,249
it takes so long to create a true zero

270
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:34,999
day delivery package to put that to to

271
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:37,699
exploit that system vulnerability that

272
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:40,040
application vulnerability and so they

273
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,220
reuse code a lot they have to they got

274
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,509
to get to the market as quick as we're

275
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:46,519
trying to patch things right and the

276
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,169
information gets shared at the speed of

277
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:50,329
light out on dark web when something's

278
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:53,660
discovered so again they're not lazy

279
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,480
they're just forced to reuse quite a bit

280
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,160
and it's that reuse is where we get them

281
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,869
with us because we'll see these code

282
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:02,179
blocks pop up and if the AV doesn't get

283
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:02,449
them

284
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:05,239
we have IPS in the background where we

285
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:06,709
have DNS that we're looking for

286
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:09,980
reputationally IP addresses etc but on

287
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,559
the AV side we catch him with the reuse

288
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,149
of these code blocks now back to AI real

289
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:17,629
quick

290
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:20,480
keep that AV in mind it'll come in handy

291
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,699
here in a little bit but let's go back

292
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:24,739
to where this stuff all came from and it

293
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:26,540
was actually Alan Turing the brilliant

294
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,730
mind of Bletchley Park that came up with

295
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,699
the concept of AI and this is way way

296
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:34,759
back in the early 1930s he said a

297
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:37,669
child's mind is kind of like an empty

298
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:39,139
computer waiting to be filled with

299
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:41,649
knowledge and experience to be taught

300
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:45,910
the brilliancy of what he he envisioned

301
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,459
was right here in these three bullets he

302
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:50,809
knew that in order to have a machine

303
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:51,980
that could think you would have to take

304
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,619
a seated population of stuff put it

305
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:56,119
through there and get something that was

306
00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:59,569
a relational back out he also knew that

307
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:00,919
you'd have to have some kind of a

308
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,779
variable weighting scheme that could

309
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:04,669
change over time so a system could learn

310
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:07,069
there'd have to be variable pieces in

311
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:07,770
there

312
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,660
and he also knew that there'd have to be

313
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,700
a method for taking out the worst

314
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,800
possible solution while retaining bass

315
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,550
the problem was he didn't have the gear

316
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,370
of the day the gear the day couldn't

317
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,040
couldn't really support this just

318
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,280
couldn't build it great theory so if we

319
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,570
look at the time line from him forward

320
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,040
he teamed up with clean and church in

321
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,290
the later 30s and they created a formal

322
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,240
proposal of what AI would look like and

323
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,270
in 1943 a very basic model of it was

324
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:42,240
built and it was proven to work very

325
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,980
very basic like the the hey line

326
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,860
Collider over in Australia or Austria

327
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,780
wherever Switzerland sorry the first

328
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,250
particle collider has anybody ever seen

329
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,400
that yeah it fit right there in the palm

330
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,380
of your hand very tiny little device it

331
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,750
was a toy of physics toy really that's

332
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,010
the same thing with this they built a

333
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,430
very basic one in 43 but it proved the

334
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:09,360
theory was valid a year before I was

335
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,520
born in 1956 it became a formal

336
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,140
discipline at Dartmouth College and

337
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,060
things chugged along pretty well with

338
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,340
governments primarily British and US

339
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,680
government's invested heavily in AI and

340
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,100
then along comes Richard Nixon and he

341
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,010
decouples gold from the dollar from the

342
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:32,010
US dollar the US dollar happens to be

343
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,980
the world's reserve currency it's what

344
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,870
we base a lot of our currencies on right

345
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,570
so he decouples gold from it we go off

346
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,850
the gold standard and the next thing you

347
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,040
know the economy start going into little

348
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,140
sputtering spins and things because the

349
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,600
lack of trusting currencies you know a

350
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,640
fiat currency is no longer trusted right

351
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,830
now we're pretty much used to it but

352
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,650
back then it was a big problem and so

353
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,940
next thing you know we had runaway

354
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,210
inflation deflation currencies were just

355
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,110
going crazy in in the US when I was a

356
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,420
kid I remember this they implemented

357
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,490
pricing controls on bread gasoline and

358
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:15,510
milk so the funding that was being used

359
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,190
for AI got pulled out and put into

360
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,230
social programs so the government's

361
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,750
could kind of start keeping care

362
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,120
of the populations and AI kind of went

363
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,430
into a dip into a winter if you will to

364
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,320
where was ignored for a while and then

365
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,020
it started to pick back up and we saw

366
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,510
Lisp created at Bell Labs it was one of

367
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,390
the first languages of AI and and things

368
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,710
were humming along it was used in

369
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,600
medical fields and things like that and

370
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,270
then something else occurred that was

371
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,810
kind of interesting our televisions that

372
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,210
were bubbles with phosphorus that iron

373
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,750
guns shot things on to all sudden this

374
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,130
little character comes on and he's

375
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,930
waving a cane looking like Charlie

376
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,000
Chaplin waddling around and it's the

377
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,860
advent of the IBM PC now this amazing

378
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,540
thing could sit on a desktop and give

379
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,280
you like things like black-and-white pie

380
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,420
charts spreadsheets it was amazing so a

381
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,250
lot of corporate investment turned away

382
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,900
from AI because all their business

383
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,420
problems could be solved with this

384
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,150
desktop machine and so it went into this

385
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:20,150
second little dive of winter after that

386
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,960
it started pick up and IBM actually came

387
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,790
up with suddenly earlier larger

388
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,250
well-known implementations of artificial

389
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,400
intelligence when I was a kid I used to

390
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,010
watch Kasparov and crazy Bobby Fischer

391
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,370
play chess and deep blue beat Kasparov

392
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,290
at chess it was an amazing thing was a

393
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,310
big headline and like I say just kind of

394
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,260
kept rolling along growing growing

395
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,820
growing 2015 just a scant three years

396
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,120
ago there were 2700 AI projects in

397
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,370
flight up and operational and working

398
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:00,280
alone there and then last year Elon Musk

399
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,380
said whoever that that we would need to

400
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,990
regulate AI before it hit the hundred

401
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,560
year mark which were just about there

402
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,750
it's that old but that's you know that's

403
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,640
putting worms back in the can that it's

404
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,439
like saying we should go ahead and and

405
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:21,380
get rid of digital currencies or you

406
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,930
know control all the drones in the u.s.

407
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,020
good luck right you can't put this stuff

408
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,580
back it's already out right now you can

409
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,210
go out and download AI applications put

410
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,460
them on your laptop night

411
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,690
start playing around with them or if you

412
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,179
want you connect into the cloud do it

413
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:39,610
just go out and interface with an AI

414
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,520
give it a problem teach it do something

415
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,010
with it you can play with this stuff

416
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:48,390
right after he said that Vladimir Putin

417
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,070
came out and said whoever controls AI is

418
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,830
going to control the world and that's

419
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,260
kind of the state we're in right now

420
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,559
should we regulate it can we control it

421
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,840
who has the biggest the best etc so

422
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,370
let's get into how this stuff kind of

423
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,070
works and how we modelled it and

424
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,830
basically it's it's kind of created in

425
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,620
our image to some degree and how we

426
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,299
solve problems as human beings the first

427
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:21,520
approach we use and one that we're we're

428
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,289
most familiar with is the supervised

429
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:25,120
learning approach its reinforcement

430
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,270
basically when we went to school you

431
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,909
know we're in kindergarten and who yet

432
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,289
taught the sky is blue

433
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:35,260
okay the sky is blue we take a test what

434
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,090
color is the sky it's blue thing there's

435
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,830
a gold star walk on what color is it

436
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,620
it's red go back try to learn again it's

437
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,270
just reinforced learning type of things

438
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,360
where we teach we test and based off of

439
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,399
the results we determine if you move on

440
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:52,899
or if you get reset to some degree then

441
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:55,120
we have this unsupervised learning stuff

442
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,220
that we use as human beings to figure

443
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,230
out our environment and what we should

444
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,940
do with this information that's coming

445
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,399
in on a flood second-by-second

446
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:07,840
the first unsupervised approach is

447
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,039
clustering we group according to

448
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,399
similarities or when I walk into a room

449
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:17,559
or an event I'll see people clustered

450
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,990
together standing and you'll see

451
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,549
different things and you start to make

452
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:23,529
inferences about what you're seeing or

453
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,690
reactions among a couple of people you

454
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,700
start to cluster them based off of if

455
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,140
two of you look at each other and go you

456
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,080
know this guy's crap or whatever I'll

457
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,640
cluster you together I'll start lumping

458
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,640
and grouping you know according to what

459
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,360
I see within my environment the second

460
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,399
method we use is dimensionality

461
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:46,330
reduction if x and y then we have Z go

462
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,610
sorry for the same joke for the dudes

463
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,300
but here it goes

464
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,500
dimensionality reduction if it's my

465
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,630
wife's birthday and I forgot it I'm

466
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,130
probably sleeping in the car in the

467
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,290
driveway there may be a variable of

468
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,790
whose driveway I get to sleep in

469
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,190
depending on how angry she is but it's

470
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,020
just the dimensionality X plus y and we

471
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,700
get this result this is our

472
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,440
dimensionality reduction approach we use

473
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,260
it walking around every day another one

474
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:15,370
is structured prediction we all wish we

475
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,130
could be the weather person and get paid

476
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,650
to be wrong you know like thirty to

477
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,350
sixty percent of the time but we're all

478
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,060
kind of weathermen when it comes down to

479
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:30,160
it how many people drove here today you

480
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,450
don't have to participate if you don't

481
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,450
want to I'm sorry when I was driving

482
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,510
here I was looking at at right I was

483
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,680
thinking about where I'd have to turn

484
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,210
what I'm doing looking at the GPS

485
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,220
looking at my speed that that died but

486
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,540
I'm also looking at the traffic around

487
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,430
me the holes the slots brake lights

488
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,560
ahead our people jammed up behind me

489
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,450
because I'm going through slow when do I

490
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,070
have to start shifting over so I can get

491
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,760
into the off-ramp things like that and I

492
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,440
use this structure prediction not only

493
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,050
to to take care of where I've got to go

494
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,150
but also to learn about my environment

495
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,730
and how to react to it then the last one

496
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,530
we use is the anomaly detection it's the

497
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,140
warders Waldo moment what's here that

498
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,210
should not be or what's missing that

499
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,250
should be here and that teaches us about

500
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,010
our environment now when we start

501
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,600
talking about deep learning machine

502
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,540
learning AI type systems they can use

503
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,210
these these different methods of

504
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,210
learning but for deep learning system

505
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,490
this is actually the best one this

506
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,410
supervised learning approach and we'll

507
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,120
go through how that works graphically

508
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:38,500
how am i doing on time good so one

509
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,900
approach is to use an artificial neural

510
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,690
network or the multi-layer perceptron

511
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,420
and how how this thing works is is it

512
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,340
consists of layers and you have hidden

513
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,910
and open layers the open layers you can

514
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,310
see what's going on you input here you

515
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,710
can see that you input something and it

516
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,270
went through da-da-da-da-da and it

517
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,010
popped out over here

518
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,679
okay two open ones now you have hidden

519
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:05,350
layers in there as well and a layer has

520
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,510
got a general responsibility within the

521
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,120
system input is for putting in files

522
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,950
output is for getting the output and

523
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,660
then you'll have other layers that have

524
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:18,070
other jobs they're called hidden layers

525
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,809
because we're not really sure what's

526
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:21,850
going on in an atomic structure what's

527
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,280
going on at that little bit level the

528
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,809
operations are so fast and so furious

529
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:28,120
you really don't know at any given time

530
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,830
unless you stop the whole thing freeze

531
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,320
it and try to go through the step step

532
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,690
step and when you're talking about large

533
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,090
systems and the velocity of which

534
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,669
they're operating it's about impossible

535
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:42,190
to do now each one of these layers like

536
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,169
I said have a general responsibility the

537
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:47,350
system that we built we had two layers

538
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,690
two hidden layers one was to look for

539
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,470
malware or recognize it the second layer

540
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,960
was to look for cleaned and we set them

541
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,360
against each other in juxtaposition they

542
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,820
fight to determine if something's ok or

543
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,250
not and we'll get into how that works in

544
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,770
a minute as well by so these layers have

545
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,870
got general responsibilities within the

546
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:12,370
system something a job function now they

547
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,350
consist of nodes and here's the second

548
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,610
term you're growing you're going to want

549
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,870
to walk out with so you have some

550
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,580
knowledge of AI and you can talk about

551
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:18,880
it

552
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,510
layers nodes and features nodes are

553
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:26,470
small applications tiny little black box

554
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,900
applications and what they do is they go

555
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,450
they get fed something off of a stack a

556
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:35,700
piece of data and they look for it now

557
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,429
the amount of what they're looking for

558
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:42,400
that gets seen is a percentage output of

559
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,559
their valuation so there's your first

560
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,840
clue into that weighted piece of AI

561
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,690
right so I pick up something I see 90%

562
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:53,049
of it I'll pass forward 90% through the

563
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:58,419
system so they've got a very very basic

564
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:01,240
limited function within this system but

565
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,250
the important one is is that they get

566
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,559
something to look at they search for it

567
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:07,720
in whatever amount they see they'll pass

568
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,220
forward now the thing that they're

569
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,380
looking for is called a feature

570
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,330
a feature is a point observable

571
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:17,880
characteristic facial recognition

572
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,500
features uh-huh right

573
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,610
but facial recognition the features are

574
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:28,150
measurements interpupillary distance the

575
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,590
size of the nose to the shape of the

576
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,039
head facial hair or not color the eyes

577
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,440
color of the hair all of these things

578
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,049
are little things that features that

579
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:40,179
this system is looking for within this

580
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,070
what we're doing is we're parsing apart

581
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,260
those malware files and clean files

582
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,320
actually but we're tearing it apart and

583
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,720
they're these code blocks and we're

584
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,320
using that as the basis for this now

585
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,450
this this pile of ones and zeros the

586
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,760
thing that the node looks for it's a one

587
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,700
to one relationship with a node and what

588
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,059
that means is as a node and a cycle of

589
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,140
looking for something I'll go out and

590
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,539
I'll grab that pile of ones and zeros

591
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,400
and I'll look for it no other nodes

592
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,820
going to look at this when I'm done I

593
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,409
don't go out and I grow I don't grab

594
00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:16,870
another one and look for it in a cycle

595
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,419
it's a one-time shot as it goes through

596
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:21,789
the system and that's important you'll

597
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:23,220
see why in a bit

598
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,630
these are maintained in this huge

599
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,450
feature repository a big stack of them

600
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:31,630
now the quality of what we have is the

601
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,120
critical part of it we have the node

602
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,830
that's going to do its percentage of how

603
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,980
much I found right but the feature is

604
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,110
weighted before it comes in for the

605
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,659
analysis and this is the second little

606
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:47,409
piece of Turing's brilliancy in a system

607
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:49,179
having to have these weighted variables

608
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:52,390
is this feature comes in with a numeric

609
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,640
value and that numeric value can change

610
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,370
over time of that of that feature of

611
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,710
that code block that comes up and so

612
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,169
that's the real variable that can be

613
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:05,320
applied by the larger system the note is

614
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,360
relatively dumb it looks for a

615
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,490
percentage and passes it forward that

616
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,470
feature can percolate up and down in the

617
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,809
stack over time in relation to those

618
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:15,760
other features and we'll show you how

619
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,630
that works it's these three capabilities

620
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,919
a layer that has a general

621
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:22,750
responsibility that consists of nodes

622
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,429
that are doing that very simple little

623
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:25,720
operation

624
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,360
picking up features that provides a

625
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,970
system with the ability to learn we

626
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,830
start out and we'll feed it the initial

627
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,139
data sets and and let it start plucking

628
00:26:35,139 --> 00:26:39,669
out code blocks and things like that and

629
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:41,620
it's extracted and put over into this

630
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,259
Mis repository and I have a graphical

631
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:46,029
model we'll see of that don't get too

632
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:48,159
wrapped up right now the main thing is

633
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,169
is that this system as it's pulling

634
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:53,669
these features out it starts seeing them

635
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:58,059
repetitively now if something indicates

636
00:26:58,059 --> 00:26:59,620
malware and you see it a couple times

637
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,200
that's going to bump up its importance

638
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,929
in that big stack of features and so

639
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:06,279
when we're sitting there cooking these

640
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:07,809
features out that are really important

641
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:09,909
it's kind of like processing gold a gold

642
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:11,769
mining operation you'll see a large dump

643
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:13,809
truck come along and they'll take that

644
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:16,289
that ore and put it through all kind of

645
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:20,889
centrifuge water chemical heat that all

646
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,509
this processing get this little piece of

647
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:23,830
gold and that's kind of what we're doing

648
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,870
with that pile of features those code

649
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,059
blocks out there is we're trying to find

650
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:30,039
the ones that are significant and the

651
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,389
system can actually change that

652
00:27:31,389 --> 00:27:34,269
weighting of that pile the individuals

653
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:37,000
within it to produce this this kind of

654
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,139
gold the more it sees a feature the more

655
00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:43,120
important it is but more importantly the

656
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,610
surety of the tell the poker tell you

657
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,870
know like somebody grabbing the ear when

658
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,509
they got Kings this feature every time I

659
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:52,960
see it it indicates that it's a clean

660
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,659
file that's important I'm going to pop

661
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:58,240
up a numeric value of that one in the

662
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,990
stack so that over time that mountain of

663
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,009
information those code blocks actually

664
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:08,799
becomes a pyramid with the most

665
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,870
important features having percolated up

666
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:14,500
to the top of it now let's talk about

667
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,450
what happens on that atomic structure

668
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,659
with a layer and a node and a feature if

669
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:21,100
we could stop this thing and take a

670
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,889
little photograph in time of feeding in

671
00:28:23,889 --> 00:28:26,980
a file and a node doing its job this is

672
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,929
what it would look like we fire this

673
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:30,429
thing in we break it down into the

674
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:33,009
binary a node goes out and grabs a

675
00:28:33,009 --> 00:28:34,830
feature that's worth a hundred points

676
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,779
okay out of the stack that's its job is

677
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:38,980
to get this one

678
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,019
and it pulls it in here's 100 point

679
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,870
value but it only sees 90% of the

680
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,480
congruent ones and zeroes in that block

681
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,850
and so it passes forward a plus 90 now

682
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,549
the next layer it connects to the next

683
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:56,409
node in the next layer and this one's

684
00:28:56,409 --> 00:28:58,179
looking for clean indicators and it goes

685
00:28:58,179 --> 00:29:00,970
out and it pulls a code block and it

686
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,679
does the analysis and let's say this is

687
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:06,639
worth a hundred points as well it pulls

688
00:29:06,639 --> 00:29:08,500
up that hundred point code block but it

689
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,840
only sees 20 percent of those ones and

690
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,090
zeros congruent with in that entire file

691
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,700
and so it's a 20 percent valuation and

692
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,380
it really is just a simple add and

693
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,679
subtract the result is a 70 percent

694
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:25,799
probability that it's this and not that

695
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:29,590
easy stuff right dumb math when it comes

696
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:33,010
down to it the complexity comes in when

697
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:36,730
you consider that a layer of an AI

698
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,840
system has its nodes right every node in

699
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,000
that layer connects to every node as it

700
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,700
goes through that system the one that we

701
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,700
happen to build has 2.3 billion nodes in

702
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,279
the malicious layer and 3.2 billion

703
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:56,889
nodes in the clean layer when we do this

704
00:29:56,889 --> 00:29:59,740
analysis and we have that output

705
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,419
decision that pops out at the end of it

706
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:04,000
now individually that no denote

707
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,850
operation is relatively simple but here

708
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,159
we're talking about 2.3 billion times

709
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:12,370
3.2 billion operations that occur every

710
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:15,220
time we fire a file into it and that's

711
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,919
where the complexity comes into play you

712
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,720
have to have massive parallel processing

713
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,950
on these things to be able to accomplish

714
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,679
this initially when we fired it up we

715
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,289
could do 58 samples per second which is

716
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:29,760
roughly 5 million samples a day now

717
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,399
remember that pile of gold that we're

718
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:34,929
mining and we're getting those features

719
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:35,919
that are more important and they're

720
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,380
percolating up to the top as we find

721
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,019
more and more of those the system gets

722
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:43,389
kind of like smarter and smarter right

723
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:44,860
because these things are gumming up and

724
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,809
it's using those top ones to spot the

725
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:48,639
stuff because they're the hottest and of

726
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:50,919
what's happening and it actually gets

727
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:52,160
faster over time

728
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,190
because of overall within that system it

729
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,350
comes up to a surety of whether

730
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,030
something's malicious are clean quicker

731
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,910
as those features get clearer and

732
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,920
clearer and percolate up to the top so

733
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,870
it actually gets faster than this as it

734
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,590
goes along

735
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,750
but there's the real complexity is the

736
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,430
number of operations that are occurring

737
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:16,100
per cycle within the system everybody

738
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,210
with me all right take deep breath and

739
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,190
we'll continue with the next part how do

740
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:26,350
you even build one of these things well

741
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,940
you have to start off in a training type

742
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:33,230
environment and you kind of have to let

743
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:37,220
the AI create that big pile of ones and

744
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,950
zeros code blocks if you try to have

745
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:44,330
humans do it and rank and rate them as

746
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,580
best as they could it would be the

747
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,800
equivalent of sticking 20 monkeys on

748
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,200
typewriters hitting the clock and the

749
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,090
stopwatch and waiting for Shakespeare to

750
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:56,750
pop out and take forever so we have to

751
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,420
let the system actually do it for us and

752
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,280
what we do is we feed it training files

753
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,750
they got these little markers saying hey

754
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,820
this is a clean file this is a malicious

755
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,100
file and the system had ingested okay

756
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,690
this is malicious and it breaks down

757
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,360
those those files into code blocks hey

758
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,400
these are malicious indicators you know

759
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,170
those little jumps those ones and zeroes

760
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,670
all right that since Melissa got you got

761
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,380
you got to get to got you and you feed

762
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,780
in more and more files and as you feed

763
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:24,080
in more files it starts to see

764
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,840
repetitions of those code blocks and as

765
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,700
it starts to see the repetitions now

766
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,410
it's going to start popping up the

767
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:33,920
importance in that stack this is always

768
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,420
a clean this is always malicious not

769
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,100
that at the dawn it starts mining that

770
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,620
gold for us the system kind of has to

771
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,950
teach itself when it comes down to it we

772
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:46,000
help it by telling it what it was fed

773
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,520
how do we know if it learned correctly

774
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,130
we give it the test so it's got the

775
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,990
features that built down in repository

776
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,180
and now we're going to feed files in but

777
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,770
we're going to remove the marker we're

778
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,120
not going to tell it what it's being fed

779
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,340
and again it ingests these things and

780
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,800
and chews them up and code blocks and

781
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,400
starts looking around

782
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,390
and even as we were training this thing

783
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:12,620
it might add new code blocks and

784
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,610
continue to learn the only thing I ever

785
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,350
learned when I take a test is I should

786
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,420
have studied longer this thing continues

787
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,020
to learn as richer as we're testing it

788
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,750
now it comes up with what it thinks is

789
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,000
the correct answer is this thing

790
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,740
malicious or clean and it puts it over

791
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,440
here now we know what we fed it so if we

792
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,420
take what we fed it and compare the

793
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,270
output we'll know if it learn correctly

794
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,580
if it learn correctly $200 Pass go be

795
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,920
happy if it didn't we SWAT it and stick

796
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,080
it back to a known state we'll kind of

797
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,720
erase whatever we just did take it back

798
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,040
and we'll try to feed the files in a

799
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,690
different order or maybe take a new

800
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:51,780
training set of files and and try that

801
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,100
approach to see if we can get it to

802
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,110
continue through this this cycle of

803
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,890
training this 5.5 billion node system

804
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:02,400
took five and a half years to train one

805
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,350
of my main points about this is this is

806
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,300
not trivial stuff when somebody comes

807
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,668
along hey we built an AI last year long

808
00:34:08,668 --> 00:34:10,679
there you go you know that's not how

809
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,399
this works

810
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,350
IBM found that out the hard way and

811
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,870
they're the masters of this you know

812
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:19,230
Watson and deep-blue right a few months

813
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,989
back there was a article I read where

814
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:26,010
they tried to Train Watson version of

815
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:30,750
Watson to recognize cancers the type of

816
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,770
cancer the stage and you know the

817
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,889
progression Diagnostics and then come up

818
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:42,600
with treatment advisement and they

819
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,940
shortcutted the training cycle on it

820
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,560
they tried to compress and do some

821
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,629
heuristics on on data compression sets

822
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:49,980
and stuff like that to get it up and

823
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,540
spun because they had customers that

824
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,040
were wanting it not as they hurried up

825
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,270
right and at the big test that blew up

826
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,530
couldn't recognize cancer couldn't give

827
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,480
a good diagnosis couldn't give good

828
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,730
treatment options it was it was bad

829
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,090
because they'd rushed this stuff along

830
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:08,070
training this stuff is not trivial you

831
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,750
step in the morning to build a real

832
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,370
system that's going to really do

833
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,260
something for you it takes time it takes

834
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,870
a lot of work but anyway so that's how

835
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:19,240
we how we kind of train and test it

836
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,010
so the result should be that we have a

837
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,750
system that we can fire these files into

838
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,430
and this getting broken down into code

839
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,380
blocks and the little nodes out there

840
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,740
and those layers are spotting malware

841
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,590
and clean files and while we're feeding

842
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:36,290
this stuff in its continuing to learn

843
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:38,360
it's it's constantly feeding new

844
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,370
features into this and it's popping the

845
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,990
wait value of the features that exist

846
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,330
based off of what it's ingesting and

847
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:47,210
seen so this is model and then we have

848
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:50,540
our output of malicious and clean this

849
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:55,160
is the the result of an AI system this

850
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,640
is what we're after now do we want a

851
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,220
whole whole bunch of features is that a

852
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,600
good thing to have lots and lots of

853
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,180
features no not really what we're really

854
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:08,090
after is quality over time we want that

855
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,520
goal to percolate up right now with this

856
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,620
five point five billion node system

857
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:17,150
we've got around 9 or 10 billion code

858
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,740
blocks laying in the repository that

859
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,810
they use and when this cycle is

860
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:23,300
initiated it goes out and grabs the top

861
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,540
5.5 billion of those features and does

862
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,780
the analysis on and of course the result

863
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,570
is yay we get to separate out malware

864
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,880
from clean files very very easily and

865
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,990
very very well now I've got about 10

866
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:42,080
minutes left how do we bring in new

867
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,910
malware samples with something like this

868
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:48,500
it's not a trivial problem these new

869
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,690
features are naturally regressed in

870
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,910
weight they have a value of being seen

871
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,120
one time so we have to do some kind of a

872
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,510
false weighting to a feature if it's

873
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,580
important and we've got to figure out if

874
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,460
it's important or not but we don't want

875
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,630
to do it in such a way that it subverts

876
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,270
that stack we've taken years to build

877
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,370
that stack we don't want to go in there

878
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,870
and just start kicking and around and

879
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:15,110
messing it up we can't use single

880
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,000
samples it would heavily skew the

881
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,860
results of what we're trying to perform

882
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,540
here which is figure out how important

883
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,280
these things are and introduce these

884
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,800
large errors again if we if we just took

885
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,170
single samples and one of our approaches

886
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,060
that for internet and not trying to sell

887
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,520
you guys anything just think we wanted

888
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,300
to be able to do this

889
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,500
in such a way that we can integrate it

890
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,290
in production with our customers

891
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:40,430
seamlessly and quietly just do this and

892
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:43,580
we had our reasons one of the things I

893
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,030
didn't bring up on that that CPR L you

894
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:50,390
know that that uber signature is we had

895
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,830
to have our engineers tearing apart

896
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:55,010
malware by hand taking out the stuff

897
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,290
that they thought was important going

898
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,820
over seeing if we already had stuff

899
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,340
created for it other signatures and then

900
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,690
the ones we did they'd have to remove

901
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,550
out and then they'd have to build

902
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,470
signatures and then you have to QA em

903
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,120
and then we have to get them out to our

904
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,260
customers and I was painful we wanted to

905
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,180
build something that would support the

906
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,490
customers seamlessly and also alleviate

907
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:21,950
engineer work give them a break let me

908
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,020
go do more interesting things so here's

909
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:29,230
what we came up with we basically have

910
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,580
about a hundred thirty threat feeds you

911
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,280
guys are probably familiar diamine girls

912
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,230
to don't don't start you know throwing

913
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,890
things at me but we have about a hundred

914
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,600
and thirty feeds that we use sticks and

915
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,790
things like that that everybody knows

916
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,590
about out there you can get new samples

917
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:48,140
and things see bees but we also have

918
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,910
about four million of our devices around

919
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,220
the planet that's constantly collecting

920
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,160
stuff and we also created something

921
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,720
called the cyber threat Alliance which

922
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,910
is counter-intuitive and a very fun

923
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:02,090
experiment in sociology we went to our

924
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,630
competitors and we're talking silence

925
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:10,220
carbon Palo Alto Cisco and we said hey

926
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,400
while we get together and join up and

927
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,310
share threat intelligence and now it's

928
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,690
just better for our customers and

929
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,790
reluctantly you know we got this pile

930
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,730
now twenty thirty participants and every

931
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:25,400
week there each participant is required

932
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,450
to submit something to the group the the

933
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:33,530
survivor version of this is that every

934
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,740
week the group judges what you input and

935
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,380
if it's deemed to be insufficient you're

936
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,540
chastised and scolded and eventually you

937
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,660
can be voted off the

938
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,789
it's kind of fun and kind of weird but

939
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:46,170
we're actually getting some good good

940
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,180
Intel and they'll share all kinds of

941
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,940
different Intel not just AV stuff but

942
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,289
anyway so we've got this incredible

943
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:55,049
chunk of stuff that could potentially

944
00:39:55,049 --> 00:39:58,140
play that we have access to so let's go

945
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,609
ahead and feed it into the system and

946
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:01,500
we're going to market we're gonna stick

947
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,390
the pin in now we have a smaller AI

948
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,460
system sitting there and we're going to

949
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,980
do a training event we're putting a pin

950
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,289
in here saying this is malware Roger

951
00:40:10,289 --> 00:40:12,299
there's some malware and it chooses

952
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:14,099
stuff and starts creating features just

953
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:15,750
like it did back in the original testing

954
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,869
phase now we have a second system as

955
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:22,440
well this one does the the undetonated

956
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,289
we unpack we unwrap we unzip there's

957
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,789
only so many ways you can do that

958
00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:29,730
down to the point of detonation we

959
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,609
hooked up another AI to a sandbox and

960
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:34,529
did the same thing there except now we

961
00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:36,509
have detonated samples going through it

962
00:40:36,509 --> 00:40:38,700
and we use that to feed IPs and some

963
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,259
other things I'll we'll get to that in a

964
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:41,819
minute so anyways we have these

965
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:45,299
disparate feature sets these may or may

966
00:40:45,299 --> 00:40:47,490
not be over here these may or may not be

967
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,170
over here but they're kind of like non

968
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,539
matching sets now to get away from the

969
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:54,599
single sample we use a rolling input we

970
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:56,700
go back like three six months and we'll

971
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,740
take everything we get that's new and

972
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,960
we'll feed it through these two systems

973
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,329
so every day we're incrementing forward

974
00:41:03,329 --> 00:41:05,519
we're not taking that single sample we

975
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:07,769
have a algorithm we use for that six

976
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:09,779
month window in relation to how long

977
00:41:09,779 --> 00:41:11,940
this systems been in existence and da da

978
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,980
da you know so that it knows how to wait

979
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,799
this stuff properly the AI site is

980
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:18,359
really really quick because it doesn't

981
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:20,400
have to do the detonation sandbox anti

982
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,960
sandbox and nuvaring and all the other

983
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,640
junk it'll do millions a day the little

984
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,859
one the other one can doesn't do about

985
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,799
10,000 samples a day 20,000 samples

986
00:41:28,799 --> 00:41:30,420
which is sufficient for keeping up with

987
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,599
new stuff the features are created just

988
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,029
like in original training

989
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:38,089
now the code blocks and behavior that

990
00:41:38,089 --> 00:41:40,920
we've torn apart using the system can be

991
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,259
used to serve the purpose of feeding

992
00:41:43,259 --> 00:41:47,910
several of our security products think

993
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,740
of the Native Americans and how they

994
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,170
treated a buffalo by the time they

995
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,730
killed it and dragged it into camp and

996
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,430
got done tearing it apart and using it

997
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,130
was very very little left over and we do

998
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,510
the same thing here we're trying to get

999
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,160
every bit of Intel we can out of

1000
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,250
everything we get so let's talk about

1001
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:08,070
just this detonate undetonated side and

1002
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:11,970
what we do there so we've got these new

1003
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,860
features remember we did the training

1004
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,530
event with it here we are we we have

1005
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,360
what what this thing thinks is brand new

1006
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,580
stuff maybe it is and maybe it isn't

1007
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,260
let's do a comparison on the production

1008
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,540
feature set and subtract off what we

1009
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,090
already had now when we do this by the

1010
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:29,780
way what happens to the features in here

1011
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,400
they get popped up a little bit and

1012
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,900
their weight value because we solve this

1013
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,820
stuff again and that's important so we

1014
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,260
have an algorithm to kind of chunks

1015
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,940
those up a little bit and here's the new

1016
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,400
features now we take the ones that were

1017
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,680
seen a couple of times or that have some

1018
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,900
criticality of dimension to them and

1019
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,120
keep those and subtract off the ones

1020
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,980
that aren't very interesting to us from

1021
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,740
the system perspective we're going to

1022
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:58,560
clean out this AI now and put the

1023
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,040
resulting features into the system now

1024
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,110
we're going to run the malware samples

1025
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,520
through and we're going to pull the pin

1026
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,770
so it doesn't know you know it's all

1027
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,600
malware but we're going to remove it and

1028
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,870
see what happens so it chews through and

1029
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,370
it comes up with features that were

1030
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:17,190
really really important critical good

1031
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:19,620
the ones that caught those malware

1032
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:23,880
samples are tagged all right now off of

1033
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,290
those what we'll do is we'll hang a

1034
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:28,410
little waiting value and stick them into

1035
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,900
that production feature set according to

1036
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,900
the time and the importance and how well

1037
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,030
they performed they get inserted into

1038
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,600
the stack by the AI system now over here

1039
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,850
we have a little CP RL remember the

1040
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:43,830
super signature we have a little engine

1041
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:47,000
that takes every possible permutation of

1042
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,420
these code blocks creates those uber

1043
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,120
signatures and runs the malware through

1044
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,890
it and we look for the ones that perform

1045
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,810
the fastest and most accurate and

1046
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:59,850
they're pushed out to our customers

1047
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:04,500
automatically now what about the sandbox

1048
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,060
side what are we doing over there with

1049
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,360
the detonations

1050
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,940
basically we're going down here into the

1051
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,620
production feature set and we've got

1052
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,820
those features and we're going to

1053
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:17,630
subtract those out again and take down

1054
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:21,710
the most important ones we're going to

1055
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:25,550
empty it out put it in feed it through

1056
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:28,640
and we get something down here that's

1057
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,680
relationally important to us once again

1058
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,090
we're going to kind of follow the same

1059
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:34,880
procedure but these are detonated why do

1060
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,570
we want the detonated stuff because we

1061
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:41,210
can use that for URL I reputation IP

1062
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:44,180
addresses IPS signatures there's lots of

1063
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,740
stuff that we can glean out of there

1064
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:49,010
that's not necessarily a V a lot of the

1065
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,360
detonated stuff once the malware

1066
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,880
detonates we can see the the c2 server

1067
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,320
URL IP address that the malware is

1068
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,150
trying to connect out to in order to

1069
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:01,820
download the system information and get

1070
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,590
uploaded orders on how to execute

1071
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:06,530
against the vulnerability so we get a

1072
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:09,260
chunk out of that we break these things

1073
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,180
apart and use just about everything we

1074
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:16,730
can get to so the result is we've got

1075
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:18,560
kind of like this dual protection thing

1076
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,310
going on

1077
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:21,370
just on the AV side there are four

1078
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:23,900
artificial intelligence engines by the

1079
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,400
way the engineers that used to make

1080
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,230
those signatures doing the grunt work of

1081
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:30,860
it we have them doing more interesting

1082
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,590
things things that humans should be

1083
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:36,380
doing instead of this they're out

1084
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:40,820
looking at botnet takedowns we're up to

1085
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,950
I think six hundred zero day

1086
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,510
vulnerabilities we've discovered in

1087
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,730
software and hardware they're out there

1088
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:49,520
doing a zero day analysis on products

1089
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,720
and things like that they're doing the

1090
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,910
things that take some human intelligence

1091
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:55,040
to do this is just the grunt work side

1092
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,260
so we let it take care of it now there

1093
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,910
is the I said there were four systems

1094
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:02,780
you saw three of them there's another AI

1095
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,760
every once awhile the engineer will grab

1096
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,030
all these signatures and QA it to make

1097
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:09,110
sure that the system is functioning

1098
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:11,630
correctly and we have another AI that's

1099
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:13,880
watching that QA process and learning

1100
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,560
how to do it based off of the human

1101
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:19,100
activity so there are four systems but

1102
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,350
the result we're trying to significantly

1103
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:22,100
increase

1104
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,320
the cost of doing business for the

1105
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,840
cybercriminals when it comes down to

1106
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:30,620
malware we have unsurpassed accuracy

1107
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,900
proven validated extremely adaptive dual

1108
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,910
protection blah da da da da it works

1109
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:36,860
it's put us up into the right quadrant a

1110
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,020
couple of different areas of independent

1111
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,870
lab test this stuff really does work so

1112
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:44,060
I've only got another minute or so let's

1113
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,650
get two takeaways done and then you guys

1114
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,260
can can or I can take a break and you

1115
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:53,210
can like get away so AI is not trivial

1116
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,250
we've been at it for eight years five

1117
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,840
and a half years just to train this

1118
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,460
system and it's not like we were doing

1119
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:01,070
it kneel on spare time weekend time this

1120
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:04,090
was a full team implementing this thing

1121
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:06,740
production for almost two years

1122
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,870
it significantly increased our catch

1123
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:11,420
rates and and our reduced our false

1124
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:14,630
positives down the accuracy of it really

1125
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:16,750
is pretty incredible it should ease

1126
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,310
technical resource demands if you're

1127
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:21,170
going to bring in a ia solution into the

1128
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,540
shop and you hear well you just got to

1129
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,100
do this for it and this for and this for

1130
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,980
it be be leery typically technical

1131
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,170
resources are stretched thin enough as

1132
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:32,420
it is you shouldn't be investing a lot

1133
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,430
of your people's time to support an AI

1134
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:36,470
that you bring in to solve a business

1135
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:39,020
problem that's just not what they're

1136
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:39,940
made for

1137
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,320
you should not have to watch it and tell

1138
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,480
it right from wrong there's some amout

1139
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,090
there that you know no no this is okay

1140
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:49,550
okay got it it's okay and you know every

1141
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:51,050
once y-you got to step in because

1142
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:52,670
somebody's raising Cain about it

1143
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:56,120
beware of buzzwords AI is a big one

1144
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:00,740
right now analytics systems are being

1145
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:04,250
touted as AI and last if anybody comes

1146
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:05,750
to you and pitches AI and they don't

1147
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,610
have some fundamental knowledge of how

1148
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:09,020
it works or what it's really doing

1149
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,270
they're probably just buzzwords selling

1150
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:13,340
to you just be careful out there you've

1151
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,510
got some basic terms

1152
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:16,310
you got some concepts you're armed with

1153
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,370
knowledge anyways thank you so much for

1154
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:20,810
your time today everybody I really do

1155
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:23,470

1156
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:36,788
