2
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:14,190
I'm here to talk to you today not about

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,900
product not about breaking into things

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,730
anything like that I'm here to talk to

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,640
you about failure and having been in

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,380
this field in one shape or another for

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,689
over 25 years I've gotten really good at

8
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,400
failing so failings not a bad thing so

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,539
one of the really interesting things is

10
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,219
I had a variant of this talk that I gave

11
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,829
in India last week and failure is

12
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,719
typically not something that you talk

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,730
about in Asia and when I talked about

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,680
them with them they went ok wait no I

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,350
see it differently now the idea here is

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,129
to have failure as a teaching tool but

17
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:48,570
before we get down that road we'll talk

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,399
a little bit of Who I am

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,840
I'm the guy that was supposed to be here

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,460
to give a came out two years ago we'll

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,579
get into that a little bit apologies I

22
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:57,510
have been doing this for quite a long

23
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,710
time I've done everything from being a

24
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,149
firewall admin all the way through to

25
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:02,879
being a CSO for a power company and all

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,580
points in between and it has been really

27
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,549
interesting run I've had the benefit or

28
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:09,960
the benefit of the privilege rather of

29
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,700
being able to work with the sector

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,500
conference in Toronto founded besides

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,390
Toronto I'm on the board of directors

32
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,119
for besides Las Vegas right for Forbes

33
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,150
etc etc etc suffice to say I don't sleep

34
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,509
a whole lot and one of the interesting

35
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,430
things is along the way you know as

36
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,590
security folks are want to do I picked

37
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,930
up moniker and along the way I went ok

38
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,939
now I have to change that moniker so

39
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,040
I've been using the moniker Gattaca ever

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,750
since it sold directly from this film

41
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,299
because my previous moniker had failed a

42
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,850
lot to to the tune of there's a couple

43
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,200
of countries I'm afraid to step foot in

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,060
they don't know who I am but let's just

45
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,950
keep it that way

46
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,710
so I am Canadian I born burn erase

47
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,950
Montreal and moved out to Ontario back

48
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,860
in 79 and I have been all over this

49
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,380
great country having a great deal of fun

50
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,939
but one of the really interesting things

51
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,619
is I've lived in numerous places I've

52
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,540
been numerous places and as a result of

53
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,640
that I have an accent that is not

54
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,098
typically seen as Canadian unless I've

55
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,489
had a few wobbly pops and in so doing

56
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,480
people think I'm an American

57
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,090
this can be problematic I was in India

58
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,440
two years ago and I was standing in a

59
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,360
hotel lobby is a nice five star hotel

60
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,099
and this lady walked up to me she goes

61
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,540
excuse me are you an American

62
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,670
I said no actually I'm from Canada why

63
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,769
she goes good and she turned and walked

64
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:31,780
away I'm really I was concerned enough

65
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,450
at that point to say okay what if I had

66
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,760
said yes to the point where I now have a

67
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,830
maple leaf tattooed on my arm just to

68
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,540
make sure that I am properly

69
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,080
authenticated speaking of which I now

70
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,250
work for do security

71
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,230
prior to this I was spent five years at

72
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,670
Akamai Technologies doing pretty much

73
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,720
the same role of running around the

74
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,099
world talking to people about security

75
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:53,860
issues and having done 20 years as a

76
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,019
defender and now on the vendor side it

77
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:59,260
is now fun for me because I get to talk

78
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,910
with folks about their security issues I

79
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,530
don't have to worry about budgets I

80
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,269
don't have to worry about Billy stole

81
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:05,650
your coffee cup I don't have to worry

82
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,840
about all that minutiae I can just talk

83
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,610
about security issues that's a lot of

84
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,769
fun for me so I joined Cisco a few

85
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:13,780
months ago and then well now I joined or

86
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,410
now it's Cisco now but like I can't even

87
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,000
get confused on this on stage on this

88
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,920
one but this is really awesome that we

89
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,769
took a small 700 person shop and blew it

90
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:26,799
up to 80,000 and my boss likes to say

91
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,930
that you know duo Cisco we're now disco

92
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,900
and you know mad props to Wendy neither

93
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,680
my boss so that's a positive that's not

94
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,030
a failure that's actually really awesome

95
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,000
but failure is something that we need to

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,950
look at as a teaching tool like and

97
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,069
there's nothing more of a failure than

98
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:46,690
quoting yourself on stage in front of an

99
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,730
audience

100
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,220
silly me but this is one of those things

101
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,200
where things are gonna happen no matter

102
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,389
what you try to do and as you go through

103
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:56,590
your career you're going to learn from

104
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,450
these mistakes or at least I sincerely

105
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,340
hope you do especially when you're

106
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,810
trying to get to a conference called

107
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,090
counter measure in 2016 and the airport

108
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,030
in Frankfurt gets locked down right

109
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,590
there that's why so that was this

110
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,840
particular bag right here some

111
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,730
knucklehead left it in the middle of the

112
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,560
aisle in the airport in Frankfurt and

113
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,829
decided to go shopping this locked down

114
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,380
the entire airport for several hours

115
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,610
myself and several hundred of my closest

116
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,080
friends missed all of our connections

117
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,920
and thus

118
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,770
I got to spend an extra night in Germany

119
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,970
fun and games now as we go through our

120
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,410
lives our signs everywhere there are

121
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,140
always signals and indicators and rules

122
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,410
about how things are supposed to go and

123
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,030
these are the things that we you know

124
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,560
understand but you have to work within

125
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,080
it as a framework very much steel and

126
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,090
outline from the matrix you know this is

127
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,570
a system of rules and we tend to break

128
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,850
them as security folks no matter how you

129
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,530
slice it that's why I like the term

130
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,970
hacker because this it shows an

131
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,070
intellectual curiosity it is not a

132
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,890
negative term unfortunately the media

133
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,420
took hold of it and we need to take it

134
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,530
back collectively as security

135
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,910
practitioners and we have to use the

136
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,560
term attacker or something akin to that

137
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,430
because that shows criminal intent now

138
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,690
these days I get to talk a lot about

139
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,700
security but when I was younger I really

140
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,410
didn't have too many opportunities

141
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,000
because I was meant to be seen not heard

142
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,790
I was part of a a baby boot baby boomer

143
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,640
generation hatching so I was a gen Xer

144
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,660
that came early on and I tended to be

145
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,730
very introverted and I tend to not to

146
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,770
want to fail at anything I wanted to

147
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,510
make sure that I was very very careful

148
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,950
about how I did things in my life

149
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,370
and early on we had before the internet

150
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,950
we had computers and back in 86 we had

151
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,020
computers in our classroom and I looked

152
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,130
at these and I thought okay this is

153
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,630
really cool and I figured out with a

154
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,100
friend of mine very quickly that we

155
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,750
could actually do pidió games and sell

156
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,850
them to other people in school may their

157
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,370
other tidy profit and then along came

158
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,560
the internet and there were all these

159
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,540
really interesting aspects of it and I

160
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,850
was very fortunate that I got to start

161
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,620
in this field of security very early on

162
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,990
I started out as a rapid application

163
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,440
developer and in my first job within 10

164
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,300
days I had joined the security team and

165
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,250
this was really really fortunate because

166
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,960
it's just right place right time this

167
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,340
particular financial institution had

168
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,740
55,000 employees and one computer

169
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,540
security person who was managing the

170
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,080
firewalls for the entire company now in

171
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,790
the media we talked about they like to

172
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,200
talk about hackers and all the wonderful

173
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,480
evil things they do and every time I see

174
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,910
a picture of a hacker in the media it

175
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,410
tends to be somebody wearing a hoodie

176
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,600
when wearing thick gloves in a balaclava

177
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,280
and unless you're sitting in a

178
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,690
datacenter at 3 o'clock in the morning

179
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,510
you don't need these particular items

180
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,540
but we tend to get this really odd

181
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,480
fixation but in all reality that's not

182
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,970
the way it is for example I got onto an

183
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,500
airplane not so long ago and I had a

184
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,820
hoodie on and jeans just because I

185
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,020
wanted to be comfortable because it was

186
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,390
a 14-hour flight sat down in my seat and

187
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,640
lady coming by she's all dressed up like

188
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,700
she was going to Ascot and she looked at

189
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,140
me she's what are you doing sitting up

190
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,000
here and it's just because that

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,680
psychology is there is the fact that I'm

192
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,300
wearing a hoodie that I must be some

193
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,160
sort of nefarious character and this is

194
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,830
really unfortunate bent the reality is

195
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,100
this is what a hacker looks like anybody

196
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,160
it literally can be anybody and as we go

197
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,390
through these things we have to learn

198
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,640
from these lessons and all through our

199
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,830
careers we're going to make mistakes now

200
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,500
when I say that we have to learn from

201
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,640
failure this is one of those things

202
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,840
where we have to understand that it's

203
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,330
not as simple as just go learn from it

204
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,940
it is an iterative process I had a

205
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,260
really interesting conversation last

206
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,370
night with somebody who remain nameless

207
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,600
because I won't out them in the middle

208
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,450
of the crowd but they had a very serious

209
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,530
incident happened to them three years

210
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,380
ago and they had become very reticent to

211
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,880
talk about any sort of security issues

212
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,220
in the public eye and I thought okay

213
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,630
this is an unfortunate thing but this is

214
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,490
just it's an iterative process there's a

215
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,780
healing that people have to go through

216
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,640
in order to get to that point where they

217
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,070
can share their lessons learned with

218
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,690
others so hopefully they won't suffer

219
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,690
the same issues like for example when

220
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,580
you miss a plane when you're going to

221
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,590
hackfest in Quebec City to give the

222
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,570
first ever security talk of your career

223
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,940
and you realize that okay that's not

224
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,040
good and you realize that if you did

225
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,930
manage to catch the next flight that you

226
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,490
would go and give a talk and then you

227
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,660
would have to sit in the airport until

228
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,340
five o'clock in the morning to get the

229
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,410
flight home again so the guys at that

230
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,850
conference actually created something

231
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,830
they called b-sides Dave they actually

232
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,330
made up t-shirts for me and they were

233
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,500
gonna come sit with me in the airport

234
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,350
but ultimately that didn't happen but I

235
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,580
survived that Nietzsche had this a thing

236
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,720
that he liked to talk about called the

237
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,270
eternal return and this is an item where

238
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,190
he looks at the world as something that

239
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,280
is a constant cycle as we go through

240
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,810
life everything that we're doing is

241
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,030
destined to repeat we're going to go

242
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,680
through life and that all through time

243
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,800
this will be a continual loop sounds

244
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,340
like awful lot

245
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,140
like security doesn't it we tend to

246
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,660
repeat ourselves but that's just it it

247
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,490
doesn't have to be that way we have it

248
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,710
within ourselves to course-correct we

249
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,960
need to change how we are doing things

250
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,540
for example zero trust how many people

251
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,790
in here know what zero trust is show

252
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,340
hands that's what I expected because

253
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,780
every different company has a different

254
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,060
version of what that is I like to look

255
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,750
at it as stuff is on fire and this is

256
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,550
just it we have been doing all the

257
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,310
elements of a zero trust model for 30 20

258
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,950
30 years Network zone segmentation

259
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,150
authentic authentication authorization

260
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,460
all of these different pieces that we go

261
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,230
through in order to build out a solid

262
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,480
security program but nowadays no John

263
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,830
Kennebunk did I said real service by

264
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,410
calling it zero trust he gave it a label

265
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,770
and it rekindled that interest in doing

266
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,900
the fundamentals right and this is a

267
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,550
really good thing because collectively

268
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,380
we need to learn these sort of lessons

269
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,930
because if I have learned anything in my

270
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,900
career is that castles don't scale this

271
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,730
is one of those things like oh it's okay

272
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,920
we got a firewall if I had a dollar for

273
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,450
every time I heard it's okay we have a

274
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,010
firewall I'd have a really nice dinner

275
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,210
at Morton's and it's just an unfortunate

276
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,110
cycle that we have to break out of and

277
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,890
when we're looking at these sort of

278
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,240
things we have to also look at things

279
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,150
like passwords passwords are an

280
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,480
antiquated notion back in 2012 I started

281
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,280
tracking data breaches on my own site

282
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,050
liquid matrix and I was going through

283
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,250
and the biggest breach we had at that

284
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,200
time was a LinkedIn breach that came in

285
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,540
about six and a half million records and

286
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,160
at that time that was pretty big now

287
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,560
we're in the billions category for sites

288
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,620
getting breached on a regular basis this

289
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,690
just really gives credence to the fact

290
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,890
that we need to find a better solution

291
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,160
to passwords because when you're coming

292
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,540
in and saying oh is this the password

293
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,370
well there's no way to know that's you

294
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,900
that has that password you just you just

295
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,880
happen to have the right entity and

296
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,590
typically you have somebody going no go

297
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,170
away until you get the right password

298
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,820
but one of the things that we have to

299
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,310
understand is that security models have

300
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,710
to change this is one of those really

301
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,780
interesting things before I ever got

302
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,490
into computer security for a career I

303
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,080
was in university for

304
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,840
studies and archeology oddly enough I

305
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,010
actually heard from my University

306
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,270
yesterday for the first time in 25 years

307
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,760
and apparently I owed them tuition fees

308
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,440
which was really interesting for courses

309
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,490
that I took when I didn't live in the

310
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,860
country so that was fun but this is

311
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,510
actually a story from when I took my

312
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,870
classes where the the Visigoths sacked

313
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,510
Rome and what they did was they set up

314
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,610
shop around the city and they cordon it

315
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,850
off and then they waited they used their

316
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,650
own security defenses against them as a

317
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,100
weapon

318
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,110
eventually it starved out the city to

319
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,670
the point where the Romans just said all

320
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,590
right we're done open up the doors the

321
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,330
city was sacked and that was the end of

322
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:46,000
it but that's just it that is a model

323
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,990
that was proven demonstrably failing in

324
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,990
410 AD yet today we still do that whole

325
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,520
mentality of it's okay we have the

326
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,900
firewall we have the perimeter we have

327
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,740
the DMZ this is these are the type of

328
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,630
things we need to learn from to move

329
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,360
forward we have to realize that we're

330
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,380
while we're being environmentally

331
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,480
friendly and reusing passwords that's

332
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,260
not a good idea

333
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,120
full credit to Karen Ella's area who

334
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,210
gave this to gave that example at sector

335
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,780
a few months ago or last month or other

336
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,670
that's just it we do silly things over

337
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,690
and over again and expecting a different

338
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,050
result what is the definition of

339
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:28,710
insanity again but that change is coming

340
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,090
we hear these stories and I hear it I

341
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,890
heard it too in the last two days where

342
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,850
people are talking about they're

343
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,140
concerned about their data being

344
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,700
resident in other countries if it's

345
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,110
Ireland you ask some things like that

346
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,820
and at one point in my career I was

347
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,160
worried about that as well I had a deep

348
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,540
and abiding concern about where that

349
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,760
data was being kept at no point did the

350
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,380
bit flip in my head going wait a minute

351
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,640
this data is encrypted and I hold the

352
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,520
keys these are one of the only are the

353
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,750
types of things we need to look at

354
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,630
differently and as we're going through

355
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,710
this and looking at these things

356
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,960
differently we have to adjust our

357
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,670
thinking accordingly when we look at

358
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,510
security overall for example this didn't

359
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,610
need to have to happen this is from

360
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,200
wanna cry these are screenshots that I

361
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,910
got from around the world this was a

362
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,440
vulnerability that was known for 10

363
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,210
years before it was capitalized on in

364
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,890
this particular piece of malicious

365
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,050
software these are the kind of things

366
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,080
that don't have to happen but if you

367
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,700
take the proper security controls and

368
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:21,970
put them

369
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,560
place make sure you have proper network

370
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,399
zone sanitation well not all controls

371
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,540
are going to work out the way you want

372
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,720
them but you want to make sure that when

373
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,519
the controls are in place that you are

374
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,319
going to be sure that when you

375
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:37,000
absolutely need that critical piece of

376
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,129
data that it will be available to you

377
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:45,160
now I just saw the Senate report from a

378
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,769
couple days ago secure okay maybe not

379
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:49,540
that Senate report but the Senate report

380
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,800
that came out by the Canadian government

381
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,540
and it was a great example of these you

382
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,129
know they're laying open and laying out

383
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:56,319
the issues and talking about them this

384
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:57,399
is something that we need to do a

385
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:59,319
collective better job of talking about

386
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:01,810
our security issues the only way we're

387
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,069
going to get to there fix them people

388
00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:04,089
always say oh we need better

389
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:06,699
communication we gotta stop talking

390
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:07,660
about it and just do it

391
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,699
my favorite was I was working for an

392
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:12,490
energy company back in mid-2000s and we

393
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,199
were put on a phone call with the DHS

394
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:16,209
and this was a weekly phone call where

395
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:17,439
you sit there and talk about security

396
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,870
issues as it pertained to the grid the

397
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,060
best part was none of the Americans

398
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,589
would say a single word when the

399
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:25,629
Canadians were on the phone it was the

400
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:27,339
most unbelievable mouth press breathing

401
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:29,110
exercise I had ever encountered in my

402
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,490
career that was an abject failure but

403
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,839
it's something we had to learn from and

404
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:37,600
move forward we have to end a Cartesian

405
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,790
join and make sure that we get off this

406
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,259
eternal return that needs to describe

407
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:43,870
and flip it on his head so that we can

408
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,879
do better things otherwise we're going

409
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:49,410
to get stuck in this loop in perpetuity

410
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,759
like there's always this tired old adage

411
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,769
but I'd love to pull this one out of you

412
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,059
know remember when you had to be faster

413
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:57,819
than the hiker that was behind you so

414
00:14:57,819 --> 00:14:59,860
that the bear wouldn't get you but these

415
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,910
days there's bears everywhere can be

416
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,339
analogous to analogous to the Russians

417
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:07,930
and things like that or you know the

418
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,329
market these are the kind of things you

419
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:11,740
know security issues are gonna keep

420
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,740
coming up you gotta accept that failure

421
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,889
is going to happen and that's not a bad

422
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:20,439
thing as long as you can learn the

423
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:22,269
lessons that are afforded to you through

424
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:25,120
that failure and share those lessons

425
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,819
with others this is how we do a better

426
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:30,220
job don't do the siloed approach of this

427
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,380
is all in mine it's going to have

428
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,959
extremely limited return on

429
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,430
so back in the 90s I was working as a

430
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,749
defense contractor in the United States

431
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:43,470
and for my particular client we had

432
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,999
regularly getting attacked by all sorts

433
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:48,759
of narrow do wells that wanted to break

434
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:49,709
into our systems

435
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:52,509
one day I showed up after not sleeping

436
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:54,429
all night because I got into some really

437
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:57,040
interesting security research I got to

438
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,720
the office sat down had my coffee looked

439
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,040
at the logs and I saw there was this one

440
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,230
particular IP address that had been

441
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,490
whaling on us for the better part of

442
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,740
several hours I got mad I hit them back

443
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,209
so I broke into their system I left a

444
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:12,459
note for the administrator saying don't

445
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:13,929
do this this and this I said really

446
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:15,819
appreciate if you cease and desist and I

447
00:16:15,819 --> 00:16:17,379
left the burner email address so they

448
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:19,800
could write me back

449
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:22,649
didn't break anything thought I was okay

450
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,319
next day I got an email to their credit

451
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,540
they were very polite about it they said

452
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,860
well thank you for your note we really

453
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,790
appreciate all the things that you

454
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,279
pointed out that we needed to fix small

455
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,929
problem though you got one of the octet

456
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:37,899
srang I actually had breached a system

457
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:39,490
that was nothing to do with the IP

458
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,730
address that was coming after us let

459
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,350
this be a lesson for you that hacking

460
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,519
back doesn't work or get some sleep

461
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:51,639
before you do it that was something that

462
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:53,379
I learned very valuable lesson that day

463
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,059
and to this point I have still never

464
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:58,209
advocated for hacking back but it

465
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:00,879
doesn't really end in there so these

466
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:02,649
mistakes can happen now remember with

467
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:04,148
the hack back thing I missed by one

468
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,880
octet I got a number wrong in this

469
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,189
particular scenario I had a vendor come

470
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:10,510
to me and say look we have this really

471
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,369
cool vaunted scanning project who will

472
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:14,470
remain nameless we'd love to scan your

473
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,359
network for you just to give you a

474
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,099
sample report so you can see how it is

475
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:20,859
that's like free is good and they went

476
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:24,279
oh yeah okay free so they said well just

477
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:26,020
give us your IP block I said all right

478
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,559
gave it to him that's a Class B yeah or

479
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:32,679
a Power Company oh they did it anyway

480
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:34,929
they scanned the whole thing got the

481
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,669
report and bless their hearts they

482
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:37,929
printed it for me it was about that

483
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:40,450
thick and I'm looking at this in the

484
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,100
courier box and going how could it be

485
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,200
this thick but because I knew that

486
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,940
particular IP block wasn't overly

487
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,039
populated open it I'm sorry flipping

488
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:48,880
through

489
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,450
pardon me there were all sorts of

490
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,610
printers that were vulnerable to this

491
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,410
that and the other thing there were FTP

492
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,850
systems that were allowing anonymous

493
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,130
logins like okay

494
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,410
that's neat I don't know where these all

495
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,360
came from and as we're going through I

496
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,179
realized the IPS were all tracking back

497
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:12,160
to Shenzhen Beijing Shanghai the vendor

498
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,830
got the IP block run so I promised and I

499
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,330
will maintain that to this day that I

500
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,110
will not name who that was but again

501
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,640
simple simple mistake could have caused

502
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,919
a bit of an international incident so

503
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:28,750
when these security issues happen and

504
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,360
they will happen you really have to

505
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,179
learn to go to your happy place you need

506
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,090
to relax because these are the moments

507
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,150
that we learn from and don't fear the

508
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,940
failures failures can happen even when

509
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,120
you have the best of intentions case in

510
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,289
point the Tacoma Narrows Bridge and of

511
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:52,590
course I have my sound on but whatever

512
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,200
let's just do that there we go so this

513
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,669
was a bridge that built it was newly

514
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:00,520
opened and it started doing this it was

515
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,289
cavitating in the weirdest way because

516
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:03,789
there was a strange anomaly that was a

517
00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:06,039
result of harmonics and wind and I can't

518
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:08,140
remember how it all goes but all the

519
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,669
best plans they tried to do set it up

520
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:11,770
this still happened ultimately when they

521
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,990
rebuilt this bridge a few miles away

522
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,059
they were able to mitigate this

523
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:17,440
particular problem but even when you

524
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,120
take the steps to make sure everything

525
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,220
is secure something like this could

526
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,169
still happen and you have to always be

527
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:24,549
preparing yourself for these sort of

528
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:27,280
things ultimately this bridge does

529
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,750
collapse I don't know if we're gonna get

530
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,220
to that part in the video before I lose

531
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,970
my focus but thankfully no people passed

532
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,620
away in this unfortunate one-dog did

533
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,390
actually expire as a result of this

534
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,720
particular bridge collapse but that's

535
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,809
just it best intentions planning was all

536
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,370
there but this still happened because

537
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,539
they hadn't accounted for something they

538
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:49,720
didn't know about and sometimes when

539
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,120
people don't know about things we have

540
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,620
to make sure that we don't jump down

541
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,110
their throats when I was working for

542
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,030
another company we had a gating process

543
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,250
where any new web application that was

544
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,809
going to go into production had to come

545
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:02,710
through our team

546
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,010
so this particular project had gone live

547
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,650
before coming to speak to us but we

548
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,760
thought all right that's not a big deal

549
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,650
we'll just we didn't know about it and

550
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,640
it wasn't been it only been live for

551
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,600
about an hour so I sat down I said okay

552
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,860
I'll do a quick analysis of it and the

553
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,320
first thing I do is view source right

554
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,300
there so and this is a browser view

555
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,160
source right there

556
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,630
that so can you imagine what I found

557
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,430
when I opened up that particular web

558
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:35,080
application any takers commented out in

559
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,420
the code username admin password admin

560
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,210
this was facing the outside world for an

561
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,360
hour pulled the plug pretty quick but

562
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,830
the really interesting thing here wasn't

563
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,990
that I didn't lose my cool I didn't jump

564
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:54,190
up and down and scream and yell the

565
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,350
admit manager for the particular

566
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,810
application development name he said I

567
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,880
hacked their application this is a true

568
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,390
story my initial reaction was one of

569
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,130
complete and utter disdain but

570
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,290
thankfully I had the wherewithal not to

571
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:16,270
blow my toes off I realized he didn't

572
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,150
know any better I had internally made

573
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,470
the assumption that he would just know

574
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,320
not to do that but he didn't even know

575
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,000
the browser you could do view source and

576
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,580
see what was there this was a real

577
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,350
troubling thing because I realized this

578
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,480
wasn't so much his failure as it was

579
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,410
mine myself and my team had not taken

580
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,480
the time to sit with them and explain

581
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,480
what we expected of them we had not gone

582
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,220
through and looked at what could go

583
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,560
wrong so this is one of those moments

584
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,910
where I had to take the sword tip put it

585
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,390
against my chest and lean forward but

586
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,650
sometimes when you do that and sometimes

587
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,510
when you fix all the problems it doesn't

588
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,620
mean that they're not gonna come back

589
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,600
this here is an actual screenshot from a

590
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,640
company that I had left a couple weeks

591
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,100
earlier and a co-worker a former

592
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,230
coworker of mine sent me an email said

593
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,190
you want to check this link out so this

594
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,590
was developer company com slash slash

595
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,030
slash but at the end of it if you can't

596
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,850
see it it says equal Etsy password

597
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,830
dumped out the whole password

598
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,080
and this was absolutely maddening

599
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,179
because this was a problem that we spent

600
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:24,039
six months fixing and as soon as I was

601
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:27,059
out of the building they unwound it

602
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,759
absolutely stunning but that's just it

603
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,440
people are gonna use tools and do things

604
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,739
that you never expect you give them a

605
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:37,599
hammer they're gonna make soup you just

606
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:39,099
you're never gonna be sure what's

607
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:42,999
happening next or they'll ask for tools

608
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:46,710
that do nothing but look really shiny

609
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,809
yes I'm digging on them apparently these

610
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:53,769
guys still exist so as uncomfortable as

611
00:22:53,769 --> 00:22:55,749
that is in our careers we need to feel

612
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,269
uncomfortable we need to be always

613
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:00,190
challenging ourselves especially the

614
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,749
security practitioners because nothing

615
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:05,289
ever stays the same way there are things

616
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:07,359
that are constants like vulnerabilities

617
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,979
that haven't been patched in 10 to 15

618
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:12,340
years one case in point every year okay

619
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,179
every year every publication likes to do

620
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:18,039
what I call it either a Year in Review

621
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:20,769
or predictions so I did a prediction of

622
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:22,509
what the next ten vulnerabilities were

623
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:25,330
going to be for the next year and it got

624
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,159
all sorts of responses and people that I

625
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:28,869
call that's really cool little did they

626
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:31,599
know as I had done a copy/paste of a top

627
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,320
ten from ten years earlier of that top

628
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,119
10 can anybody guess how many of those

629
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,830
vulnerabilities were still in play close

630
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,909
nine ten years later nine of those ten

631
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:47,799
vulnerabilities were still in the Oh in

632
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:52,659
the wild now this is just that thing we

633
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:54,639
can do a better job we can get off that

634
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:56,590
eternal return we need to sit down and

635
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,749
evaluate where we are in our career are

636
00:23:58,749 --> 00:24:00,549
we comfortable in doing what we're doing

637
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:02,499
is their day jobs or do we need to

638
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:04,440
challenge ourselves to move forward and

639
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,460
that's only a question you guys can

640
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,609
answer yourselves what tools that you

641
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:11,349
have available to yourself to help you

642
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:14,200
choose that career path or you want to

643
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,609
give talks at a conference do you want

644
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:16,989
to write papers are you gonna learn

645
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,119
projects on the side when you have

646
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:21,580
things like AWS and Google's cloud and

647
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,559
Azure and all these things you have all

648
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:24,879
these opportunities to build out

649
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:27,309
networks that just simply weren't around

650
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:29,710
when I started I literally had to cobble

651
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,590
together hardware

652
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,809
from various projects and build little

653
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:35,240
labs and watch the power bill spike and

654
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,470
thankfully my boss never said anything

655
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,390
but that's just it you want to make sure

656
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,039
you're building a solid foundation for

657
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:43,010
yourself because things are going to go

658
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,559
wrong and when you're building out not

659
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,120
only your career but anything you're

660
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,679
working on you want to make sure that

661
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:50,929
you're building it to fail what do I

662
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:53,539
mean by that you want to make sure that

663
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:56,179
it's not five nines five nines is dead

664
00:24:56,179 --> 00:25:00,110
and dusted we want to make sure that it

665
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,250
is built to be a hundred percent uptime

666
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,890
whatever it is and in these days that is

667
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,659
actually feasible that is possible

668
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,250
except when the consultant comes in to

669
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,110
do a project for you and sits down at

670
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,490
two thousand dollars a day and the first

671
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,260
thing he does on day one is open up the

672
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,140
manual and start on the first page this

673
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,610
happened to me while I was at blackhat

674
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,649
where my second he calls me up he's like

675
00:25:21,649 --> 00:25:23,960
you're never gonna believe this we had

676
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,070
this consultant come in to do a project

677
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,230
for us and this is exactly what he did

678
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,600
I sincerely hope that he learned from

679
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,580
his mistakes because unfortunately that

680
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,090
actually cost him his job that very day

681
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,929
these are the kind of things that we

682
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:37,340
make sure that we're doing our homework

683
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,490
it's constant we can't just stay still

684
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,649
and we have to understand that things

685
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:47,750
can and they will go wrong so when you

686
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,539
are in your career one of the things I

687
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:52,070
get a lot of questions about is like how

688
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,360
do you get into blogging how do you get

689
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,770
into this and writing and all the rest

690
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,070
of it honestly you just take your shot

691
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:01,010
you just sit down and do it I started my

692
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:04,330
website 20 almost 21 years ago now

693
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,770
literally because I was finding articles

694
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:07,940
that was sharing them at work and people

695
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,320
said all this is kind of cool where did

696
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,149
you find it and then I realized that

697
00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:12,409
most people didn't have access to this

698
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:14,029
information at that time it was before

699
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:16,250
aggregators were a thing so I built up

700
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,720
my own site which was I guess a blog

701
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,679
before a blog for blogs but this was a

702
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,419
great way to share information and it

703
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:24,470
was just very much an altruistic

704
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,750
endeavor and over time that helped me

705
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,490
build out my career helped me build out

706
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,289
my understanding of things and the only

707
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:31,730
reason that it worked for me because I

708
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,429
just kept at it I had so many emails

709
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:36,230
from people over time that told me I was

710
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,700
a complete I had no idea what was

711
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,580
doing and like okay thanks thanks mom

712
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,390
but it was it was a great iterative pro

713
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,520
it helped me to learn by putting myself

714
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,840
out there by taking that chance and for

715
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,490
people that say they don't have the

716
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,670
ability to do X whatever X maybe this is

717
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,830
my field where I grow I'll leave it

718
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:01,160
there we need to make sure that we are

719
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,270
looking beyond the haze far too often I

720
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,480
find a lot of security practitioners and

721
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,890
more and more of us are actually leaving

722
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,179
social media platforms

723
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:13,040
it'll get wrapped up in these silly

724
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,690
little bun fights between each other

725
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,400
about you know who's a better hacker

726
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,750
than who and all this sort of thing it's

727
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:21,169
like absolutely of no value but we as

728
00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:22,760
practitioners get lost in that same

729
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,929
thing with the zero day vulnerability

730
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:25,669
when that comes out we go oh we got to

731
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:27,679
pay attention to this meanwhile the

732
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,000
Oracle databases have them in patched in

733
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,260
three years we need to make sure that

734
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,090
we're maintaining our focus because

735
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,470
otherwise we'll start spiraling into the

736
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,210
dark places and we'll start thinking

737
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,919
things very much a negative vein

738
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,840
towards ourselves and towards others and

739
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,820
that's where you get very jaded security

740
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,210
professionals and we get lost in the

741
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:52,309
minutiae we miss those fine details and

742
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:53,870
before I go too much further all of the

743
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,040
pictures in here that you're seeing are

744
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,360
actually by my friend Pam Julianne I

745
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,500
just want to give her credit for that

746
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,830
they're use them rather liberally so

747
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:05,330
here's an idea ask for help are you

748
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,590
working on something or you want to

749
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:09,230
learn something ask for help you have

750
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,090
Olas groups in here you have b-sides

751
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,650
groups here you have all sorts of

752
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,059
community endeavors you have

753
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,370
countermeasure right here network with

754
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,919
your peers I realize this is the last

755
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:20,990
talk on the last day but take this as

756
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,340
your homework assignment when you leave

757
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,440
make sure that you reach out to folks

758
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,120
and make these connections because you

759
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,820
have a very solid foundation here as a

760
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,030
security community and understand that

761
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,190
in so doing you're going to learn and

762
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,100
hopefully avoid problems like this first

763
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,770
time I ever gave a talk akin to this two

764
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:42,260
hours before I went onstage I saw

765
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,450
somebody sent me this this was a data

766
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,830
security company and this is not to bash

767
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,150
on them particularly but it's to learn

768
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,669
that it could happen to anybody your

769
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:52,429
data is secure calm was not exactly

770
00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:54,230
secured their entire site was tired

771
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,730
tired up in a sequel database ER and

772
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,990
free to anybody who could download

773
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:02,920
we all want security for ourselves we

774
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,800
all want that security but we don't

775
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,480
typically personalize that for example

776
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,600
how many people here and don't look at

777
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,740
the camera when I say this how many

778
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,110
people in here have a home alarm they

779
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,520
don't put your hands up think about that

780
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,910
for a second a one guy puts his hand up

781
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:22,900
all right thanks for coming out all

782
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,810
right but that's just it it's like was

783
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,910
that because your house was broken into

784
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,880
or you're just professionally paranoid

785
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,590
for me it's like one of those things I

786
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,210
suffered through a data breach for one

787
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,950
company I was working at where a site

788
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,720
that we had were told by our marketing

789
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,730
team was going to be taken down was

790
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,800
still up two weeks later and ended up on

791
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,240
the front page of the CBC and several

792
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,580
other publications with that got

793
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,300
compromised and I felt so bad I didn't

794
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,040
sleep for three nights because I took it

795
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,930
very personally not because the

796
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,160
marketing team didn't take it down but

797
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,690
because I didn't follow up with them to

798
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:58,090
make sure they took it down we as

799
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,580
security practitioners need to own that

800
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,250
particular aspect of things far too

801
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:06,010
often we do it was his fault that's not

802
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,420
going to help us move the ball further

803
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,640
down the road in addition to reaching

804
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,230
out you also have to trust your team

805
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,520
that you're working with in the event

806
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,500
you're working with a team you have to

807
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,420
be able to have that synchronicity with

808
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,070
them because there is safety in numbers

809
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,050
and it gives you that chance to learn

810
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,790
because everybody has a different skill

811
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:24,400
set we all have an opportunity to learn

812
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,960
from each other and we want to make sure

813
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,410
that we're not running ourselves aground

814
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,790
I've seen too many of my friends burn

815
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,710
themselves out and unfortunately are no

816
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,020
longer with us today because they didn't

817
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,730
have the wherewithal to reach out they

818
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,500
didn't have the moment to pause and say

819
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,160
I need help make sure you're able to do

820
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,310
that make sure you're able to cut the

821
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,890
tether as well as you're going through

822
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,720
don't get stuck on these preconceived

823
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,270
notions it's okay we have a firewall

824
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,930
everything's good preconceived notion

825
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,480
consider that that's not enough somebody

826
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,410
comes to work one day and they're a

827
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,180
really bad mood that firewall is not

828
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,640
gonna help you you need to find a

829
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,980
balance in your career you want to make

830
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,300
sure that you're taking time to be at

831
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:07,690
home

832
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,480
I travel a great deal for my job and a

833
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,680
lot of people have asked me how

834
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,080
do I do it but I it only ends up being

835
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,120
about 44 2% travel over the

836
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,090
year-over-year which for me is actually

837
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,910
manageable I've had friends that did 90%

838
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:25,120
travel that cost them more than they

839
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,240
care to admit

840
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,550
now when you're having an interview one

841
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,720
of the questions always comes up is

842
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,250
where do you see yourself in five years

843
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:36,610
I used to hate that question but then I

844
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,470
realized it's taking a moment to pause

845
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,230
and plan know what I want to do next

846
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,750
it's an again is this a learning process

847
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,910
we have to make sure that as we're going

848
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,040
through our career we're constantly

849
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,360
challenging ourselves looking for the

850
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,770
next thing because if we're just sucking

851
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,950
a lather rinse repeat what what's the

852
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,950
value and if you have a plan in place to

853
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,990
understand where you want to go next and

854
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,360
plans change they don't ever stick the

855
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,540
same way ever but if you have that plan

856
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,550
you've got that ace in the hole and you

857
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,290
need to be able to make yourself take

858
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,060
chances

859
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,190
now one chance that I took years ago I

860
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:15,220
was working for a bank in Toronto and I

861
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,740
met a young lady when I was on training

862
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,660
now this was back in the early days it

863
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,310
was called net Ranger or Weil group net

864
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,080
Ranger ultimately ended up being Cisco

865
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,590
IDs and there was myself a whole room of

866
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,300
gray hair and this young lady came in

867
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,800
sat down and we ended up hacking into

868
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,930
each other's computers and sending each

869
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,120
other notes we ended up hitting it off

870
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,010
having a relationship little did we know

871
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,140
that the entire thing was recorded and

872
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,210
to this day is still used as a teaching

873
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:45,280
tool for that course I wonder if they'll

874
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,390
give me credit for that now that I

875
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:49,540
worked for the company but that's just

876
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,040
it is it we went through that and then I

877
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,300
decided I was gonna move down to

878
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,680
Charleston South Carolina to be with her

879
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,840
and much to my chagrin I was single

880
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,230
before the plane landed that was fun you

881
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,150
don't always win but you got to take

882
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,680
that chance otherwise you'll never find

883
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,910
out the best thing that happened to me

884
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,220
was that I did take that chance I did

885
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,660
move down there even though the

886
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,460
relationship fell apart I had a great

887
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,980
job I ended up working on projects for

888
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,220
the Pentagon the FBI US Navy all kinds

889
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,720
of amazing things I was talking about

890
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,120
you know how to properly shield devices

891
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,880
in outer space it was an amazing

892
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,710
opportunity and otherwise I would have

893
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,890
been stuck doing the same job

894
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,450
that particular financial institution

895
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,870
that failure of my relationship falling

896
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:36,380
apart ended up leading to a success and

897
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,060
one of the back to the site I was

898
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,200
talking about earlier this was an early

899
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,730
iteration of liquid matrix where I

900
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:43,070
literally took the HTML framework from

901
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,770
hacker news calm my friend space rogue

902
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:48,020
and used it for my own site it looks

903
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,790
like this today but that's just one of

904
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,350
those things is over time these things

905
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,270
have developed and they've grown much in

906
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,940
the way my career has - these are the

907
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,290
tools that you use to help better

908
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,880
yourself as well as sharing the

909
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,380
information with others because

910
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,410
sometimes things will go well other

911
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,320
times they'll go horribly squiffy

912
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,130
weren't the Morris worm is a great

913
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:10,460
example Morris worm got out ran rampant

914
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,810
across the internet but that was never

915
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,139
the intention of the worms creator

916
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:16,280
mistakes are gonna happen we have to

917
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,110
have the skills in place to tackle these

918
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,270
issues when they do unfortunately as

919
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,860
security practitioners this is how we

920
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,350
tend to see the world view against

921
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:27,880
everybody that's not a great way to be

922
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,260
we need to stop aligning against

923
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,389
ourselves we need to do a better job of

924
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:34,790
communicating within our own peer groups

925
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,918
and understanding what we don't know and

926
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:38,870
sharing what we do because otherwise

927
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,310
things like this are gonna happen when

928
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,290
you have CNN talking about the hacker

929
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:46,520
4chan which was not a hacker um another

930
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,040
thing entirely that was one of my

931
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,860
favorites of all time you need to share

932
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,260
those war stories that you have

933
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,270
particular example was one company I was

934
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,100
working with I controlled all of the IDS

935
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,960
system for that particular company and I

936
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,640
wouldn't let anybody touch it I handled

937
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,170
all the patching I handled all the log

938
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,300
review every aspect of it because I

939
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,550
didn't have the wherewithal to trust our

940
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,580
maintenance team to take care of it

941
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:13,040
much of my own failing ultimately I did

942
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,590
learn to let go when my mentor said this

943
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,150
is the only way you're gonna grow is

944
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,220
when you let go of that system because I

945
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,660
didn't understand that once I let go of

946
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,790
it there's 18 million other things that

947
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:26,480
I could work on I learned to let go see

948
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,600
ya

949
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:34,390
sorry it was just too easy there later

950
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,520
so another example of where things can

951
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,930
go wrong I was working for a company

952
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,600
that had a global footprint and in this

953
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,430
global footprint we had a flat network

954
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,010
so imagine that a flat network global

955
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,130
MPLS circuits as far as the eye can see

956
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,600
this was one of those crazy moments

957
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,210
where we had a group in one of our

958
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,190
Southeast Asia offices that had decided

959
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,690
they wanted to download crack movies

960
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:59,270
until the cows came home MPAA Andrea

961
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,690
showed up in my office they were not

962
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:05,060
happy and we couldn't understand for

963
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,740
life of us how this was ever happening

964
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,240
we looked at the log files we went

965
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,470
through them and said look there is

966
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,410
nothing in these log files until we sent

967
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,660
a guy there from another office he flew

968
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,760
in and he did a harder target search and

969
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,230
he looked through it and he found out

970
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,030
that the characters in that office had

971
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,860
actually gone to the lengths of building

972
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,390
a stub network that routed around the

973
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,310
firewall we were checking the firewall

974
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,490
logs we weren't checking the edge router

975
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,690
failure on our part but we learned a

976
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,820
valuable lesson that day

977
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,380
thankfully NPM RIA went away as soon as

978
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,580
we explained the whole thing and that

979
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,760
was actually a surprise all by itself so

980
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,380
when things go wrong it can go one of

981
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,300
two different ways it all depends on how

982
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,670
you frame that discussion you want to

983
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,170
make sure that you don't get lost in the

984
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,850
minutiae of it and make sure you pull

985
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,320
back and say what is the value that I

986
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,970
can learn from this particular problem

987
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:53,180
and those problems will keep coming one

988
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,350
power another power company that I

989
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,640
worked for we had this really

990
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,110
interesting thing we had this strange

991
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,640
noise that was coming onto the floor so

992
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,960
we went out into the raised floor we got

993
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,660
the tile lifter nothing there nothing

994
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,030
there third tile we lift up there's a

995
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,040
Cisco 1750 blinkin back at us that

996
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,250
nobody knew existed this particular

997
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,440
company used to be part of a larger

998
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,030
company and it's been split into five

999
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,670
other companies and this was turned out

1000
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,040
to be a hard link back to one of those

1001
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,220
other companies which is for all intents

1002
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,680
and purposes a competitor but they

1003
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,900
didn't know it was there either that

1004
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,390
could have gone so horribly horribly

1005
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,390
wrong because it wasn't documented but

1006
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,920
we actually shared that lesson and I

1007
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,450
will talk about this until I'm blue in

1008
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:36,980
the face at every conference that I go

1009
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,840
to because this is a great example of

1010
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,840
always be checking everything you want

1011
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,220
to make sure you're sharing

1012
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:49,640
lessons learned we fail we learn and we

1013
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,400
grow and we can grow not only as

1014
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,550
individuals but as a community you have

1015
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,410
to sit down and realize that you're not

1016
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,010
alone especially when you consider that

1017
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:03,619
somebody pitched an idea so crazy that

1018
00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:09,950
it took off got to refocus our lens on

1019
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,710
how we see the world last week I was in

1020
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,900
India and I had a day where I was able

1021
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,550
to get away to a grow so I took a train

1022
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,680
out there and I got to ride in a tuk-tuk

1023
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,940
for the first time in my life it's a

1024
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,500
small little scooter type vehicle and

1025
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,330
this is my view from the backseat or

1026
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,340
rather this is my view as I was in the

1027
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,790
backseat because wow traffic in India is

1028
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:32,000
something else but the rewards are out

1029
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,730
there if you take that chance you put

1030
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,650
yourself out there and you realize there

1031
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,660
are opportunities out there if you take

1032
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,340
that chance you move beyond your

1033
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,950
comfortable spot and I never thought I'd

1034
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,950
find a moment of Zen in a Marvel film

1035
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,660
but if you've seen the movie Doctor

1036
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,390
Strange there's one in there it's not

1037
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:53,690
about you it's about all of us we can

1038
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,390
step off that eternal return I'd like to

1039
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,730
thank you to all of you to counter

1040
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,310
measure and all the crew and for all the

1041
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,900
sponsors and making sure that this

1042
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,220
conference happened and I really

1043
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,200
appreciate you having me here today

1044
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
thank you

1045
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,240
