[Music]

2
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,540
cool so we're here to talk about

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,060
self-driving cars right and the first

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,590
thing that I think people don't realize

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,689
about self-driving cars there's a bunch

6
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,240
of levels to these things and the the

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,310
first one is kind of level zero this is

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,740
a car that isn't really self-driving at

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,869
all it's made as a designation for

10
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:33,600
things that don't self drive right and

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,520
so as a little bit of background we've

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,440
worked at uber I worked at DD for a

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,700
while we work at a company called crews

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,710
now doing security for self-driving cars

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,559
so after we hacked cars we moved on to

16
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,360
try to figure out ways we could like

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,730
secure the newest technologies and so

18
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,780
self-driving cars are pretty cool things

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,940
we'll talk lots about it but not these

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,260
things these are the cars that I grew up

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,940
with it they're not gonna get hacked

22
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,430
they're the safest from cyber tech you

23
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,350
want to be probably not very safe from

24
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,960
an actual real world life usage so you

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,390
know as we move on to the next level of

26
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,090
these things we have things like a Jeep

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,979
Cherokee right and and these are cars

28
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,380
that have some kind of assistance

29
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,750
available to you they'll kind of break

30
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,970
if it's about to hit something it'll

31
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,460
kind of slightly adjust the steering it

32
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,680
may Park for you but generally speaking

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,990
the driver is still responsible for all

34
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,420
control right so this idiot oh wait

35
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,110
that's me

36
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,750
this idiot so this is this is we'll talk

37
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,950
about this in a bit but this is we

38
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,960
crashed Andy Greenberg into a ditch

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,729
there and he's from New York and they

40
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,140
don't know how to drive cars I guess so

41
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,390
I don't he also cried too for the record

42
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,700
Andy Greenberg cried yeah he was he was

43
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,149
terrified anyway so he couldn't get it

44
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,340
out so local Midwestern boy had to get

45
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,140
in the car and and retrieve it from the

46
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,920
ditch which which I did do exactly but

47
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,229
as you move on right you have kind of

48
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,729
partial levels of automation this gets

49
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,810
us into the Tesla territory I don't know

50
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,759
if they took the name autopilot off I

51
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,220
think they did right but essentially

52
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,410
this will give you some ability for the

53
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,940
car to drive and kind of make decisions

54
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,890
on it

55
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,440
but at the end of the day still for

56
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,510
level three the drivers still

57
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,100
responsible so while you have may have

58
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,140
this system that does things that that

59
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,050
look like autonomous driving in

60
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,490
actuality when it comes down to it the

61
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,590
the drivers still responsible for all

62
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,760
these things that all right so it'll

63
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,680
salt drive for a bit but if you're not

64
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,940
holding on the steering wheel it'll

65
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,350
it'll beep at you because you're

66
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,030
supposed to be responsible despite what

67
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,220
the ads that Tesla sometimes say and

68
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,430
like GM has a similar technology and

69
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,900
there it has a camera that looks in your

70
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,819
eyes and if it notices your eyes aren't

71
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:45,110
looking at the road it beeps at you so

72
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,790
these are technologies to make sure like

73
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,070
yes we're helping you we're not trying

74
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,600
to drive the car by itself you're not

75
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,310
allowed to get sleepy right so sorry the

76
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,880
level to so level 3 now is we're getting

77
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,209
a point where the car in certain

78
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:05,570
situations doesn't expect intervention I

79
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,360
think a good example is outies what

80
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,540
traffic jam pilot essentially you could

81
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,430
sit there and read the newspaper or

82
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,680
Twitter or whatever people read in the

83
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,410
car and it will do its thing for you

84
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,500
without much expectation for you to take

85
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,570
over right so in this case it's in a

86
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,519
very particular situation it will drive

87
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,640
for you but you you you get out of that

88
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,829
situation or it finds in an error that

89
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,450
it can't handle then you're supposed to

90
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,860
take back control so you don't have to

91
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,090
pay attention all the time but you have

92
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,010
to still be kind of ready to happen if

93
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,700
something goes wrong so this takes us to

94
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,090
level 4 and level 4 is what Charlie and

95
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,730
I are concerned with and what we what we

96
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,940
do as he said before we used to work at

97
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,480
uber on their level 4 cars and we now

98
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,150
work at cruise automation on our kind of

99
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,590
level 4 cars that's a picture of one

100
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,040
there these are designed to solely drive

101
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,260
themselves there there doesn't even need

102
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,540
to be a driver in the car there may not

103
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,540
even be a steering wheel and pedals it

104
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,370
is probably limited in area it's not

105
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,570
going to go everywhere you're not gonna

106
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,579
go to Grandma's house but if it Maps

107
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:15,980
some area this car is capable and

108
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,690
supposed to be capable of driving

109
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,640
without human intervention alright so

110
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,130
for a particular fixed area and

111
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,539
particular conditions like weather

112
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:25,490
conditions the car can drive itself with

113
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,260
no human

114
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,120
and when we talk about security

115
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,290
self-driving cars we're talking about

116
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,610
this we're not talking about securing

117
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,130
Tesla's or so what yeah a lot of times

118
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,750
we like Oh what about self-driving cars

119
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,070
and we'll talk about a Tesla or

120
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,140
something in traffic jam while those are

121
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,030
interesting these are really what piques

122
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,710
our interest and this is kind of where

123
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,600
our expertise lies now because we're on

124
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,850
kind of company number two from e

125
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,230
company number three for Charlie of

126
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,060
figuring out how to secure these things

127
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,070
against the tax we're running out of

128
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,440
companies or for we are running out of

129
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,730
cut this might be it we got to work at

130
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,760
crews forever now level five is

131
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,800
basically KITT from Knight Rider it will

132
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,630
go anywhere and do anything and handle

133
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,510
any situation we have we're not there

134
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:04,900
yet

135
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,320
robbery not a problem yeah rob the bank

136
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,930
for you haul it out no one's driving no

137
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,020
big deal this is basically the the end

138
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,490
goal the holy grail for self-driving

139
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,500
right you set a car in the road and it

140
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,350
can literally go anywhere dirt road you

141
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,020
know in the city whatever KITT from

142
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,460
Knight Rider hopefully it comes someday

143
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,620
yeah we're not there we don't know how

144
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,960
to get there but someday hopefully we'll

145
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,710
live in a world where that's the case so

146
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,150
there's lots of companies that are

147
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,860
working on this problem and some have

148
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,430
have done more than others if you look

149
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,530
at some of these statistics you'll see

150
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,940
well like one of the things and some of

151
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,920
these statistics are a little old but

152
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,900
the thing that's sort of amazing is way

153
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,520
mo for example has driven 4 million

154
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,780
actually they've driven 10 million miles

155
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,570
now so like imagine how long like humans

156
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,220
never gonna drive anywhere close if you

157
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,630
have a car with a hundred thousand miles

158
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,250
on it right you've probably had that car

159
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,450
for quite some time

160
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,220
think about orders of magnitude more

161
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,050
mouse-driven right and the reason they

162
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,760
have to drive so many miles is the cars

163
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,950
need to to be tested and like these

164
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,390
weird corner cases that maybe you see

165
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,250
once in a lifetime but they need to be

166
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,800
able to see that enough to test it and

167
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,210
make sure it handles that situation and

168
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,100
maybe iterate and like maybe didn't

169
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,540
handle it so they add some new code and

170
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,040
then they got tested again but you can't

171
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,750
just make these weird once and lifetime

172
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,670
things happen spontaneously you have to

173
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,110
just drive and drive and drive until you

174
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,610
see those things actually and you'll

175
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,960
notice there's kind of three names

176
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,660
listed here but you'll go online and

177
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,730
you'll see 40 companies they're doing it

178
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,380
try driverless cars right and they're

179
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,760
doing their demo and it's on the highway

180
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,290
and it's great that's awesome you know

181
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,090
what's really hard to do pull up to a

182
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,740
stoplight with someone crossing when

183
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,700
they're not supposed to

184
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,470
a bicyclists on your right someone

185
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,940
coming behind you and bi to make a blind

186
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,920
left and that's why you have to drive

187
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,240
all these mouths and that's why this is

188
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,190
a really hard problem it's not driving

189
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:48,670
on the highway

190
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,950
that's generally okay and people were

191
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,060
smart and can figure that out it's

192
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,520
really the crazy interactions and crazy

193
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,410
situations that you get yourself into as

194
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,200
a driver that that requires all these

195
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,550
mouths to be driven and the other thing

196
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,080
to notice about those three companies is

197
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,210
their goal at least for now is to end in

198
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,430
a ride-sharing kind of situation so none

199
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,720
of these companies at the current time

200
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,460
plan to sell the car so they're not

201
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,770
building self-driving cars intending to

202
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,750
sell them to people who will just drive

203
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,220
them or or have them drift ride them

204
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,420
around there they're set up to be like

205
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,220
you would call one happen it would take

206
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,720
you somewhere you'd hop out and it would

207
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,540
drive off and that's gonna have a lot of

208
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,710
implications when we talk about the

209
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,340
security of the cars so there's what a

210
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,590
way mo looks like it's in a Pacifica

211
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,900
yeah I think way mo recently to just

212
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,850
we're the first ones to sign that they

213
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,680
could operate without a driver in the

214
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,510
vehicle in California so yeah and

215
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,950
they've been doing that already and yeah

216
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,050
in Arizona and way mo has been doing

217
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:44,230
this for ten years Google you know so

218
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,400
they've they've been kind of doing this

219
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,440
whole project the longest I think their

220
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,690
car is kind of ugly I'm not a Pacifica

221
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,200
guy not a Pacific guy here's the the

222
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,020
uber car that both Charlie and I spent

223
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,410
some time you know securing I think it's

224
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,510
a better looking car than that Pacifica

225
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,580
minivan personally having the Consumer

226
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,910
Reports cars it's it's a pretty slick

227
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:12,160
looking Volvo xc90 again they they've

228
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,270
been on the streets for a while they're

229
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,280
off the streets now for a bit and you

230
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,810
know they're still doing active

231
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,010
development for these things so yeah

232
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,350
they had an actual ride-sharing service

233
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,850
before anyone else that you could just

234
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,950
any person could call for an uber and

235
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,840
sometimes one of these would show so I

236
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,370
lived in Pittsburgh where the

237
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,500
development of this was mainly based and

238
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,600
it was cool because the way they mapped

239
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,789
the city my house ended up being on that

240
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,559
map so I would get one of these kind of

241
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,120
to and from work almost every day so I

242
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,799
got to take driverless cars to work

243
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,510
every day which is rad and it didn't

244
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,729
cost me anything so it was cool so if

245
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:44,260
you like one of the things you want to

246
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,060
look at on these pictures is what's

247
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,010
different about this car from an XD 90

248
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,780
which is buy from a lot and right away

249
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,160
you notice there's stuff on the roof so

250
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,660
there's gonna be like some high NARS and

251
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,320
some other

252
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,060
censors there's gonna be cameras along

253
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,190
the edges and and more radars and other

254
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,329
things so just keep an eye out for

255
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,560
things that look different and we'll

256
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,970
talk more about like the actual

257
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,259
differences in a bit but you'll notice

258
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:04,000
like it does if you saw that driving

259
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,230
down the road you'd be like what is that

260
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,149
thing so it they look different than the

261
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:10,839
normal cars obody look at that that

262
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:13,300
looks like a beaut huh that's probably

263
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,980
the best-looking one out less in this

264
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,079
company big toy I would definitely

265
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:21,310
definitely pitch this in a sales pitch

266
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,750
real quick now no so this is what the

267
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,209
first second third generation cruise

268
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:31,149
vehicle again you'll notice a bunch of

269
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:33,009
different sensors on it right you have

270
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:36,730
radars that try to see things at short

271
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,759
distances long distance lied ours on the

272
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,500
roof and a bunch of other sensor

273
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,350
packages the other big differentiator in

274
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,600
this car then the other two is this one

275
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,610
is purely electric so you're no longer

276
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,220
dealing with hybrid vehicles the reason

277
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,630
that everyone uses hybrid vehicles is

278
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,399
we'll talk later you have these massive

279
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,829
computes in the car and you need all

280
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,600
that electricity but the cool thing

281
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,130
about this is you no longer have to

282
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,529
worry about things like oil changes or

283
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:04,930
putting gasoline in it you know these

284
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,430
things are purely electrical and they

285
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,110
can get a charge and be on their way

286
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,610
everything is kind of right about these

287
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,339
is like say uber buys these cars from

288
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:14,319
Volvo but this is a car that's made it

289
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:16,149
in a General Motors factory because

290
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,550
General Motors owns a bunch of cruise so

291
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,350
the self-driving car rolls all the

292
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,360
factory ready to go instead of buying a

293
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:40,750
car and added a bunch of crap to it yeah

294
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,910
has anyone been in one raising hands

295
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,670
anyone one person sweet yeah it is it's

296
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,230
a pretty wide experience like your the

297
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,120
cars driving the steering wheels turning

298
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,529
the person is in touch with the gas the

299
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:51,939
brake it's it's a it's a great

300
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:53,319
experience and it's cool to see right

301
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,240
and it's wild at first and then you do

302
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,620
it a bunch and then it's not it's just

303
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,910
sort of boring and that's kind of the

304
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,800
point yes I used to take like a selfie

305
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,880
every time I was in the car and then I

306
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,310
was just like just just go just just let

307
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:07,810
it drive hurry all right so let's talk

308
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,550
about some of the differences that

309
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,470
you'll see and we already talked about

310
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,069
this but it's basically but it takes a

311
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:16,600
car and it adds much hardware to it and

312
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,310
it makes the car like way more expensive

313
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,600
it's more expensive than you'd want to

314
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,430
buy even if you could buy it unless you

315
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,589
were some millionaires yeah exactly so

316
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:26,740
to give you example some of those things

317
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,510
like a lidar on the roof depending on

318
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,760
which one you buy can be seventy five

319
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,769
thousand dollars for a single device and

320
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:35,170
it can break and you can maybe brick it

321
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,720
if you do bad stuff like these are

322
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,399
really expensive right now the cost of

323
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,990
these will come down in time as we

324
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,029
figure out you know as a technology

325
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:45,040
group how to make them cheaper but right

326
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,110
now it's prohibitively expensive for an

327
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,370
individual to do this type of thing so

328
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,899
the biggest difference you'll notice in

329
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:55,600
the car is the is the the roof with all

330
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,189
the sensors and so here you'll see this

331
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:58,750
is them installing in a factory and you

332
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,040
can see a bunch of those little things

333
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,630
that look like big hockey pucks those

334
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,819
are elide ours and we'll talk a little

335
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:06,459
bit later it looks like in a bit I don't

336
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,569
think if you see anything else but

337
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:08,620
usually on the front of the car there'll

338
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,610
be some extra radars

339
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,709
over you bunch of cameras and the sensor

340
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:13,449
package where the black dots are those

341
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:15,069
are cameras and those aren't like you

342
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:16,839
know dashcam cameras these are super

343
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:19,269
high resolution cameras capable of you

344
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:22,959
know doing image matching of in

345
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,970
classifications and things like cars and

346
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,760
bikes and people so lidar we talked a

347
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,959
lot about this is what the computer

348
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,059
basically sees so lidar is it's a in

349
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,559
this one it's spinning it's shooting out

350
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,500
pulses of light I guess and recording

351
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,029
how long it takes to come back and and

352
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:39,490
you get an idea of

353
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,870
you know what's out there and then it

354
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,210
has some sort of algorithms that try to

355
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,680
map that into things that it can

356
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,630
classify so here you can see the blue

357
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,910
boxes it thinks for people and and it is

358
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,300
and the red boxes or cars and so from

359
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,700
that it can you know determine what what

360
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,620
the world looks like so you look at

361
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,790
something like a Tesla they're trying to

362
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,000
do everything with with pure cameras

363
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,380
with with images we just kind of like

364
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,660
how humans work but all the three that

365
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,160
we've been spending a lot of time on use

366
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,720
lidar because this is kind of the best

367
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,740
technology for yes

368
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,020
what what's crazy is most people use

369
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,420
valid ein light ours right now and I

370
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,130
think David Hall and his brother of the

371
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,920
guy they'd been that company I'm a dummy

372
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,440
but they somehow figured out how to

373
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,290
measure the bouncing of light using

374
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,029
electronics which kind of blows my mind

375
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:26,290
right you're using electricity to

376
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,360
measure the speed of light and that's

377
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,529
essentially how lidar works it just

378
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:31,510
shoots lasers about and figures out how

379
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,220
fast it bounces back off the things that

380
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,300
it hit the compute is the main

381
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,490
difference you know I think especially

382
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,230
we've been kind of chatting about car

383
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,959
security for five six years at this

384
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:46,720
point and most people think of you know

385
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,779
this is just an ECU this one unit the

386
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:52,120
compute needed to process all this

387
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,550
images and light our data points and

388
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,730
radar and kind of time synchronize that

389
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,339
and make it work is more like a Bitcoin

390
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:04,029
mining rig than it is an ECU in in a

391
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:05,980
regular car right a massive amount of

392
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,339
computers needed to do this stuff yep

393
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,020
and so there's also gonna be a part

394
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,700
where you've got this huge computer it's

395
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,620
got all these the sensors that it's

396
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,120
reading from and then it's got to decide

397
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,160
what to do so it's like okay I want to

398
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,390
start turning the steering wheel so it

399
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,860
needs to communicate that to the rest of

400
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,750
the car and so the rest of the car is

401
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,240
probably just a standard car which is

402
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,890
kept talking like a can bus all the

403
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,570
components and so it needs to be some

404
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,640
sort of link between those big computer

405
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,490
making decisions and the can bus and so

406
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,790
usually there'll be some extra ECU that

407
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,410
translates from whatever the computer

408
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,230
wants to talk to the can lesson and tell

409
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,670
it to do things like you know speed up

410
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,020
or slow down or turn the steering wheel

411
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,709
yeah the big point for this right now is

412
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:49,720
almost well everyone who's doing kind of

413
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,880
self-driving is taking a car that was

414
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,260
originally built

415
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,300
to be a passenger vehicle like have a

416
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,860
driver in it and kind of making it a

417
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,720
self-driving car so that's kind of why

418
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,380
this architecture is necessary in the

419
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,410
future you could see companies building

420
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,870
specifically self-driving cars so when

421
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,190
they're designing a car they're not even

422
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,390
designing it to have a steering wheel in

423
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,550
it or pedals or things like that right

424
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,770
you know compute could directly make

425
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,660
these actuators do things so this is

426
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,280
kind of a byproduct of just the world we

427
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,200
were worrying right now not to mention

428
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,970
the computers we use are just like

429
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,530
regular computers they're not specially

430
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,750
designed to be in a car so they're not

431
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,210
gonna have some some dedicated interface

432
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,750
to talk to the car components next up is

433
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,630
the the riders in the car have to have

434
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,520
some sort of interface to talk to the

435
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,920
car so right now this is on the left you

436
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,900
can see what way Mo's looks like on the

437
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,310
right is ubers and they're basically

438
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,780
just like tablets of some kind

439
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,940
and this'll you can use to say like you

440
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,320
know tell the cars stop because it's

441
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,520
supposed to be a ride-sharing service or

442
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,380
like where you want to go take a selfie

443
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,570
yourself as you're on your trip Twitter

444
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,000
you can do that yes some of them do have

445
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,580
built-in selfie taking technologies had

446
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,660
a thing where you could have button it

447
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,950
would take a selfie and post it and

448
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:06,490
hashtag it for you the future is these

449
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:10,120
things are used to provide data to the

450
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,730
the passenger about what the car seen to

451
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,110
give them some sort of confidence like

452
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,790
you can see that the car sees there's a

453
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,140
person you can see that the car is

454
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,700
intending to turn it otherwise you're

455
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,620
like what's going on so it's nice that

456
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,120
it's just a way for the computer to kind

457
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,990
of reassure the passenger that

458
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,370
everything's okay right now they're

459
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,780
using them as Charlie said it's

460
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,440
reassurance

461
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,660
hey yes I see those that's a bike and

462
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,160
that's a person and we know a stop signs

463
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,690
coming up and we see the lights red not

464
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,560
green stuff like that

465
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,470
Ethernet so so again we're using these

466
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,410
massive computes and they need to send

467
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,810
more data than then what's usually sent

468
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,600
on a vehicle bus in comes Ethernet which

469
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,400
is great right because we understand

470
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,170
this Ethernet is kind of the wave of the

471
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,490
future when it comes to automotive

472
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,320
because you have more bandwidth it's

473
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,030
faster kind of you know more universally

474
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,860
understood than things like CANbus and

475
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,750
that's essentially how all this stuff

476
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,460
communicates with each other network

477
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,040
switches compute devices that Ethernet

478
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,089
think of this just

479
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,919
much like a data center you have in an

480
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:11,020
office but it's in a car all right

481
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,579
well talk about some bit but it's good

482
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:14,709
for security because can basically sucks

483
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:16,119
for security and we know how to secure

484
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,919
stuff on Ethernet so it's a big help the

485
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,500
more stuff we can get on Ethernet so

486
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,199
like we've seen the you know the we're

487
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,669
not gonna show exactly how the cars

488
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,439
we've seen or built and but we've seen

489
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:27,730
two or three different versions of it

490
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,029
and basically they all have this sort of

491
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:32,260
architecture and that you know there's

492
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,370
gonna be some differences but they're

493
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,929
all gonna have you know some sort of

494
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,850
sensors hooked up to Ethernet and the

495
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,650
reason that is is because the types of

496
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,570
sensors you buy off the market or

497
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,679
already set up for Ethernet they're not

498
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,940
set up for any kind of other things so

499
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,770
stuff gonna be some Ethernet component

500
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,909
there's gonna be this big computer we

501
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:47,440
talked about there's gonna be some

502
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,909
device that communicates to the outside

503
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:51,549
world and then there's gonna be a bunch

504
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:53,919
of vehicle ECU's like your brake

505
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,960
controller or your engine and those are

506
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,039
gonna be on can and then there's gonna

507
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,649
be some link in between them and so

508
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:00,760
these are the components the way you

509
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,899
hook them up might be a little bit

510
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:03,490
different so a might instead of looking

511
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,750
like this it might look more like this

512
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,490
so maybe things are some of the things

513
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,690
that cameras are plugged directly into

514
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,549
the computer or your Tom Macs might be

515
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:11,279
directly plugged to the computer or

516
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:13,870
maybe the computer is plugged straight

517
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,940
kind of into the module it goes to the

518
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,620
can and working so I'm going to Ethernet

519
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,240
so there's like a few variations but for

520
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,970
the most part the topology of the inside

521
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,620
of the car looks exactly like this yeah

522
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,679
so there's no kind of set standard right

523
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:28,270
like people just make it up and it's

524
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:33,130
definitely not this Wow for an advanced

525
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,500
company it's not like this for four

526
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,360
people competing in this space right now

527
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,419
for it is not that right it's more like

528
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,299
this so it's it's it's just your trunk

529
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:45,100
you just full computer pieces and

530
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,960
switches and and you know massive

531
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,510
computers and it's like you're not going

532
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,799
to put your suitcase in the trunk any

533
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,600
more like just deal with that yeah just

534
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,919
don't take a suitcase just buy new

535
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,490
clothes where you go in this trash yeah

536
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,190
but you know in just to go back to the

537
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,590
previous picture these are kind of

538
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,260
prototyping right if you would see one

539
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,970
of these in productions you definitely

540
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,090
don't have a Netgear soho switch in the

541
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,549
back right like you you have real actual

542
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:14,260
parts but you do stuff like this when

543
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,159
you want to figure out if something

544
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:17,260
works right and then this is how it

545
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,299
looks now but maybe in 20 years it's

546
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:20,410
going to look like one little time

547
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,800
ECU and that's it yeah I mean look these

548
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,320
things right I mean this was this would

549
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,690
been a supercomputer so long ago you

550
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,800
would only think that things like that

551
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,270
in cars will get smaller and smaller as

552
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:35,280
time goes on yep

553
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,140
okay so this is like a super important

554
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,110
point is you get a lot of people talking

555
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,430
about like how do cars know where

556
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,230
they're at right and people just assume

557
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,880
as GPS because that's how we get around

558
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,350
like when you want a good from point A

559
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,360
to point B you put in your Google Maps

560
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,120
and it takes you there via GPS but GPS

561
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,620
is not accurate enough for self-driving

562
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,150
cars we have to use this technology

563
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,970
called localization in a way this works

564
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,240
is you sent out a car first it takes a

565
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,370
very detailed map of where everything is

566
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,130
it knows where every you know speed bump

567
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,100
every pothole every bush everything in

568
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,240
the world that knows where it is exactly

569
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,580
and then you drop the car down in the

570
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,130
middle of someplace and it can tell it

571
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,960
takes a lidar reading and by comparing

572
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,150
its lidar reading to these previous

573
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,700
readings that it's that this mapping

574
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,620
Cardos it knows exactly where it is to

575
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,870
within like I don't know a centimeters

576
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,090
yeah you know you're doing with GPS

577
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,650
you're dealing with give or take a

578
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:32,200
couple meters right for the high

579
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,820
resolution localization needed for

580
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,200
self-driving cars we're talking

581
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,350
centimeters right so it definitely can

582
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,900
tell if the kerb is a foot away or 1/2

583
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,730
foot away right so this is very

584
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,890
important and again this is what level 4

585
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,900
is level 5 is KITT from Knight Rider

586
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,840
driving where every once level 4 is hey

587
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,640
we've mapped this city or we've mapped

588
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,830
this portion of this city to the

589
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,810
centimeter level now we're gonna use

590
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,580
these sensors to do a thing called like

591
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,140
background subtraction right we know

592
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,760
what the world looks like what is it

593
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,620
what what's new here alright and if you

594
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,600
want to know like why the big difference

595
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,850
in level 4 in level 5 is this map so if

596
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,470
you didn't need the map we could get to

597
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,510
level 5 but but the map is so important

598
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,050
to us right now

599
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,790
because that's the way that the lidar

600
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,810
works and that's the way we figure out

601
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,370
where things are there and he mentioned

602
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,200
the subtraction thing what that means is

603
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,850
like if you've taken a scan of a

604
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,920
particular road like a hundred times and

605
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,740
then all of a sudden you take another

606
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,780
scan and there's this new thing then you

607
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,950
know that wasn't there before that's

608
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,510
probably like a person or a car or

609
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,790
something that's not normally there so

610
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,440
it's it's like too hard computationally

611
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,090
to figure out everything like you've

612
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:34,480
never

613
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,100
before but by figuring out what the

614
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,780
world usually looks like and comparing

615
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,520
that to what you see now you are able to

616
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,410
pull things out of that you might say

617
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,850
Chris and Charlie doesn't that mean that

618
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,830
these cars are on the street constantly

619
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,600
mapping and looking at things because a

620
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,070
new construction site could pop up

621
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,440
tomorrow yes these cars are always out

622
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,790
mapping most of the time if you would

623
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,559
see self-driving cars on the street

624
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,120
their mapping cars getting new

625
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,160
information and uploading those maps

626
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,620
which are updated you know daily by

627
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,260
daily so yes these cars are always out

628
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,669
the street right now figuring out what's

629
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:06,280
new and letting the other cars know and

630
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,960
so here's how like a video of

631
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,730
localization in action so you can see

632
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,240
that what the car is seen and the car is

633
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,350
the thing in the red and as you pull

634
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,390
back you can see in the white is what

635
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,040
the the world look like in different

636
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,049
spots to the car and so am i comparing

637
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:22,299
what it sees in the green to all these

638
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,640
different sort of images it hasn't white

639
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,020
and knows exactly where it's at so

640
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,760
that's how localization works and we'll

641
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,140
talk about why this is important mostly

642
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,840
because if you know you like you see a

643
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,669
lot of things in the paper about GPS and

644
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:36,610
and how like oh well we'll spoof GPS and

645
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,870
make all of the self-driving cars crash

646
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,549
it's like it doesn't matter they don't

647
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:41,290
use GPS so you can spoof all you want

648
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,660
and the cars are gonna use local way man

649
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:48,340
its rightful way they also require a

650
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,559
certain level of connectivity right I

651
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,230
mean in most modern cars this is a nice

652
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,000
luxury feature you can hit a button and

653
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,559
attempts I'm going to talk to and they

654
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,929
can figure out Diagnostics but again as

655
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:01,240
Charlie said before the kind of big

656
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,650
players in this are doing it for

657
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,150
ride-sharing so you're gonna need to

658
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,890
know where the car is where it needs to

659
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,530
go it's gonna want to tell you stuff hey

660
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,150
here's how fast I'm going here's the

661
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,500
software I'm running things like that

662
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,390
right and so some cars today aren't

663
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,890
connected at all but soldering cars are

664
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,700
always gonna have some connectivity

665
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,640
finally let's talk about hacking hmm

666
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,340
here's my boys so uh a lot of people

667
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,299
think that we were the first view of the

668
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:27,370
highway car not true these guys were so

669
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,730
a group of academics back in 2011 I

670
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,880
think they hacked a car and the way it

671
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,260
was this beautiful car over here and so

672
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,470
I want to talk about how hacking works

673
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,360
against cars because if you don't

674
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,980
understand how actual attacks work you

675
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,169
can't build effective defenses so we'll

676
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:48,340
talk real quickly about

677
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,450
all the different attacks that have

678
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,820
happened and that'll help steer us in

679
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,830
ways to figure out how to defend against

680
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,170
them so the way the academics did it

681
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,900
they had two ways they did it so the

682
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,090
first one was through a Bluetooth

683
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,250
vulnerability so the head unit like the

684
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,280
radio of the car had a boner ability and

685
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,140
the way they process Bluetooth so at the

686
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,210
if these guys were within 30 meters of

687
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,010
the car like Bluetooth range they could

688
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,980
send some Bluetooth frames hack into it

689
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,110
get code execution on the head unit and

690
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,610
then they want to do something like

691
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,380
control the brakes but it turned out

692
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,810
that there was they were the the radio

693
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,490
the head unit was not on the same can

694
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,470
bus as the brake so they couldn't just

695
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,290
directly send messages to the brakes

696
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,670
there was this gateway module in between

697
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,980
and the game a module separated those

698
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,300
two networks but they were able to

699
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,690
reprogram the gateway module to let him

700
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:38,860
do whatever they wanted and one of the

701
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,940
things they wanted to do is send

702
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,170
messages to the brakes and they were

703
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,330
able to do that we'll see this is like a

704
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,820
common thing in car hacking and and

705
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,080
something that's really important think

706
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,760
about it so that was their their first

707
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,830
attack like their being within 30 meters

708
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,320
is like pretty rad you don't have to

709
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,730
like touch the car but still like that

710
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:58,420
wouldn't say it was cool not rad by my

711
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,940
definition okay okay okay have you say

712
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,790
so did I do all right so they found

713
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,560
another another version of their attack

714
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,300
which was stronger which was through the

715
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,830
cellular network so this one didn't have

716
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,450
that 30 meter range limit yeah it also

717
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,920
had some other limitations which I'm not

718
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,480
getting into anyway this one was pretty

719
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,580
good so they could just dial into a car

720
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,020
because the car had these cellular

721
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,330
modems there was a vulnerability they

722
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,220
had code execution on it and that

723
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,860
particular telematics unit was already

724
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,990
on the same bus as the brakes so they

725
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,760
could just in two steps they could hack

726
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,140
into the telematics unit

727
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,730
send messages to the brakes and control

728
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,080
the brakes and again this was they could

729
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,730
do from anywhere it's pretty rad

730
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,560
it definitely was rad right and this is

731
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,960
what basically inspired us to get into

732
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,700
car hacking is reading this paper right

733
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,800
this is no limitation this car is just

734
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,020
somewhere in the United States and they

735
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,940
can hack into it and apply the brakes

736
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,840
that's Wow

737
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,820
so here's a video of them doing their

738
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,390
attack so yeah so it's not it's not like

739
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:55,060
in Greenburgh style it's it's very safe

740
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:59,020
there Joel right organized they care

741
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,930
about people's safety

742
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,600
so yeah so you see like the guy's got a

743
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,580
crush Lebanon okay I don't think we gave

744
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,200
me any greenberg crash I'll do me

745
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,060
his hair is this helmet yes anyway

746
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,980
they're driving they're gonna remotely

747
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,010
attack this car and they lock up the

748
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,350
brakes and and make it come to a stop on

749
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,970
a on a race track

750
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:22,260
yeah just like it's pretty awesome

751
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:27,200
so so yeah so that was their attack and

752
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,670
like when when I read that paper I was

753
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,010
like dude let's let's do this like I was

754
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,720
stoked right it's like but but when you

755
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,400
read a paper and you want to get into it

756
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,460
it's uh like how do you expand on that

757
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,810
like how do you extend their work and

758
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,940
the problem for from us was they did

759
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,130
everything they did from like you know

760
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,770
the complete execution of you know car

761
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,180
hacking remotely to control that brakes

762
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,560
like there was nothing else for us to

763
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,470
really do which was kind of a bummer but

764
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,120
but one thing that was different about

765
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,800
what they did and versus what we did was

766
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,380
they didn't really publish anything so

767
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,170
they didn't say what kind of car it was

768
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:03,360
although we know like we're not dumb

769
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,370
they say her car was they didn't say

770
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,450
what the vulnerability was they didn't

771
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,860
say what message they sent they didn't

772
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,180
say how they controlled the brakes it

773
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,340
was like just like hey we did this and I

774
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,900
totally believe them but there was no

775
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,420
way you could use that to make cars

776
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,510
safer or two to make car hacking like to

777
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,740
learn how to do car hacking it wasn't

778
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,740
useful to really anyone except Justin as

779
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,680
a like a welcome awareness of this

780
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,900
problem imagine alpha-1 releases

781
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,400
smashing the stack for fun and profit

782
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,190
and it's basically like yeah you can use

783
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,680
stack data to hack a computer have fun

784
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,830
y'all right so like we wanted we were

785
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,780
like no information needs to be free we

786
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,400
want to release it all right so there's

787
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,280
us so we in a few years later in 2014 we

788
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,230
did the Jeep and we release all our

789
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,440
tools and and we we like hundreds of

790
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,150
pages of paper all our tools all our

791
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,830
theta we want people to learn from this

792
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,870
we want other people to go and and kind

793
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,760
of do this stuff we're only two guys we

794
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,380
can only look at so many cars right and

795
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,460
the other thing that was different was

796
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,990
not really something we did but

797
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,580
technology had improved from tooth out

798
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,820
the car they had think it was a 2010 car

799
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,410
and ours is it doesn't 14 so in four

800
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:09,330
years car technology improves a lot and

801
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,070
so now the only the only reason they

802
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,570
could only do brakes was that was the

803
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,560
only thing that was computer-controlled

804
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,600
but now

805
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,090
we have steering and acceleration so we

806
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,380
had more things we could play with and

807
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,960
we did so let's look at how our attack

808
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,370
worked and you'll start to notice

809
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,570
similarities and that's kind of the

810
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,150
point of talking about this is we had a

811
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,760
remote code execution through the the

812
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,429
cellular connection of the car we had to

813
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:34,910
reprogram this gateway chip because we

814
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,169
couldn't directly send messages to

815
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:38,030
things we reprogrammed that chip this is

816
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,770
exactly what that connects did and then

817
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,809
we could send messages to the brakes and

818
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:44,870
steering so very similar to the attack

819
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:47,360
that that the first attack that academic

820
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,429
sent but we we had steering control

821
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:51,260
because at the time when they did it

822
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,570
there wasn't things like steering assist

823
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:54,919
or parking assist but when we had this

824
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:56,299
car there was which were computer

825
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:57,530
controlled so that gave us the ability

826
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:00,049
to do more right it wasn't that we were

827
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:01,429
smarter and figured out how to control

828
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:02,990
steering it was just that their computer

829
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,730
didn't have the ability to control

830
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,770
steering and as time moves on right more

831
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,150
things in the car computer controlled

832
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,250
that's an inevitability so this is at

833
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,350
the end of it right so here's our demo

834
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:20,270
it's also a test track we we were cool

835
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,750
it was in a cornfield don't worry yeah

836
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,450
so yeah so you'll notice in the video

837
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,580
remotely attack into the car control the

838
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,809
steering turn the steering wheel to the

839
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,669
right I'm hacking he's driving and

840
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:34,640
you'll notice if you see it that he the

841
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,140
steering wheel turns he tries to fight

842
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,030
back and get control the car yeah but

843
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,350
it's too late we're already I need to

844
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,690
take some more high-performance driving

845
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,760
school lessons I could countersteer fast

846
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,190
enough and we right so that's that was

847
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,350
our attack since then there's been some

848
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,669
other attacks that you may or may not

849
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:52,549
have heard of so in 2016 the Keene team

850
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:55,100
from China hacked into a Tesla and the

851
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,740
way their attack worked was again a very

852
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,270
similar diagram you'll notice there's

853
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:02,030
was a web browser exploit and that ran

854
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,000
on the what they call the CID which is

855
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,320
like the head unit the big screen and

856
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,390
the Tesla there's a web browser web

857
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,770
browser exploit so they got control of

858
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:12,169
that but again that particular component

859
00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:15,950
can't send messages directly to the can

860
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,230
bus and so they had to have this gateway

861
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,990
in between they reprogram the Gateway

862
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,669
just like all these other people did

863
00:30:22,669 --> 00:30:24,110
then they could send messages to the

864
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:27,130
breaks and make it do stuff and

865
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,370
that's the another item of note to is

866
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,010
they exploit an old WebKit bug so this

867
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,540
was like a known vulnerability and

868
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,040
WebKit and it just so happened that

869
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,020
shockingly the car didn't have the most

870
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,730
up-to-date version of the browser right

871
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,450
so this again is where the future of

872
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,920
automotive internet things is going is

873
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,150
they're gonna borrow where they can

874
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,290
write you don't want to write a brand

875
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,850
new web browser you're gonna use

876
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,050
something that's known but at the same

877
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,400
time if you can't keep it up to patch

878
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,700
level bugs exist right and so one of the

879
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,470
things also to think about this is are

880
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,690
tax and the academic attack well you

881
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,860
could do from anywhere in the country

882
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,780
you could attack any car you wanted here

883
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,040
because it's attacking into a web

884
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,100
browser you have to get the the victim

885
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,300
to do something you have to get them to

886
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:11,320
click a link or to have visited to be

887
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,810
nearby and try to intercept some

888
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,040
messages and trick their web browser

889
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,690
newsom so anyway it was a much harder

890
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,310
attack it wasn't quite as dangerous in

891
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,230
the sense of scale as the other attacks

892
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,270
were you talking about so let's see

893
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,200
their demo contra

894
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,540
oh they're gonna apply the brakes here

895
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,560
so uh it's like that I'm here he's

896
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,800
driving this thing this message cracks

897
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,030
me up that you should only do this if

898
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,740
you're a security researcher I guess we

899
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,130
can do that

900
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,850
[Applause]

901
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:45,890
they're implicitly telling us we can do

902
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,320
exactly that so yeah that's their attack

903
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,440
it's it's a you you'll notice like it's

904
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,460
you know the same kind of thing it's

905
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,050
like you get your foot in the door of

906
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,000
the car you reprogram something that's

907
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,200
keeping you from sending kin messages

908
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,640
then you send a message and make it do

909
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:05,090
stuff so in 2018 they weren't done the

910
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,220
same exact guys keen team they found a

911
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,650
boner building the BMW i3 this

912
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,660
vulnerability was a little different so

913
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,540
here they had if they could trick the

914
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,120
the cellular modem to connect to their

915
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,010
malicious base station they could send

916
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,470
text messages to it again this meant

917
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,360
that you had to be kind of local to the

918
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,560
car so you weren't gonna be able tech

919
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,660
any car you had to be nearby and then

920
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,280
again there was this gateway in the way

921
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,130
of controlling messages to the the

922
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,780
steering or brakes or whatever and this

923
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,190
time they did not figure out a way to

924
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,350
reprogram the gateway so progress is

925
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,770
being made this is like an example of

926
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:41,150
effective this defense in the sense that

927
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,790
they did get execution code execution on

928
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,650
to the the head unit but they were not

929
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,030
able to control the brakes because of

930
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,740
this gateway module so like you can

931
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,210
start to learn lessons like okay well if

932
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,560
we have a gateway module let's like make

933
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,300
it really tough that you can't just

934
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,660
reprogram it really easy yep seems

935
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,350
reasonable right so you know again we're

936
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,300
concerned mainly with remote attacks

937
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,000
right yes there are a bunch of local

938
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,250
attacks you can do but at the same time

939
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,380
if you're in the car you can also just

940
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,870
light on fire whatever if you want right

941
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,000
local attacks with physical control

942
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,310
that's that's the our biggest concern

943
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,200
right because that's when things start

944
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,830
include you know dealing with passenger

945
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:24,770
safety driver safety if if you saw those

946
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,380
diagrams you kind of saw how it all went

947
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,150
down and they all had similarities it

948
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:32,240
was kind of some on authenticate access

949
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,730
to the vehicle and then the ability to

950
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,430
reprogram Porsches portions to do

951
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,290
whatever you want and then the ability

952
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,720
to make actuators perform physical

953
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,350
actions so it's it's pretty kind of well

954
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,060
known how these attacks all work and

955
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,650
then at least that gives us a good

956
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,000
blueprint to how to secure these things

957
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,650
all right and of all that research we

958
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,880
talked about that's the only research

959
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,720
that's ever been done

960
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,060
and that showed remote attack to

961
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,500
physical control so of all the things

962
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,880
you hear about in car hacking like this

963
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,310
is it soz for exactly three examples for

964
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,600
the fourth one was kind of like what

965
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,230
what doesn't work so so yeah so don't be

966
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,880
like too super scared of car hacking

967
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,469
like it's never been done by bad guy

968
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:13,820
it's only been done by researchers and

969
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,500
only those three groups have done it but

970
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,880
that's not to say we're not concerned

971
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,500
with it right the stakes are just higher

972
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,900
if my Amex gets stolen with some browser

973
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,310
exploit and they got on my banking of

974
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:22,969
information

975
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:24,560
someone's gonna make me whole the reason

976
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,449
that we are so proactive about this is

977
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:29,000
it does involve human safety human life

978
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,710
so that's why we're really serious about

979
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,389
it even though there aren't active

980
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:34,060
exploit campaigns going on right now

981
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,409
Chris tell us about some advantages of

982
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:39,500
self-driving cars oh man so at first you

983
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,120
look at this right and this is a

984
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,820
daunting task this is a picture of a

985
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,850
prototype of what Cruz's future cars may

986
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,190
look like you'll notice no steering

987
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,760
wheel no pedals right nothing for anyone

988
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,949
to actually drive with it's basically a

989
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:57,980
seat on wheels and it goes at first this

990
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,710
is a daunting task well before even as

991
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,720
Charlie mentioned when we hacked the

992
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,580
steering of the Jeep I at least had a

993
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,290
shot I failed

994
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,570
driving failed miserably but I had a

995
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,100
shot to grab that wheel and correct the

996
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,360
course I'm ready feel better that you

997
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,490
had a shot no I don't feel good about

998
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,960
myself in general but that's beyond the

999
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,900
scope of this presentation but yeah in

1000
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,970
here right there there's no shot this is

1001
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:22,370
all computer control there's no physical

1002
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,740
things for anyone to grab on to maybe

1003
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,530
other than the oh bar right so it's

1004
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,700
really important to get security right

1005
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,470
in these kinds of cars so tell us

1006
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:35,390
alright so the nice thing is we have

1007
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:38,570
advantages a lot of the problems and and

1008
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,220
I'll use the Jeep again because I'm most

1009
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,230
familiar the biggest problem there was

1010
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,240
we were able to compromise this over the

1011
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,040
seller airwaves there was no way for

1012
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,140
this to be updated over the airwaves

1013
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,030
right Tesla has that advantage but at

1014
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,190
the time Fiat Chrysler didn't the cool

1015
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,160
thing about self-driving cars are right

1016
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,380
now they're all owned by the company not

1017
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,060
by the people that means they come home

1018
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,380
every night that means they can get

1019
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,540
updates every night that means we can

1020
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,640
ensure if we are using some open source

1021
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,490
software that at least on a daily if not

1022
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,230
more than multiple times a day they are

1023
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:12,860
capable of getting updates they're

1024
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,410
locked away it's not let these things

1025
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:16,730
right now or just sitting on the street

1026
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,260
they come out with these garages there's

1027
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,970
security guards it's not like people

1028
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,230
were in there physically tampering with

1029
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:24,740
them so we we have some advantages right

1030
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,540
now from a self-driving effort that

1031
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,670
permits us to ensure that these cars get

1032
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,980
updates and have some level of physical

1033
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,180
safety there's not someone monkeying

1034
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,410
around at all yeah you also get the

1035
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,880
chance when the car comes in every night

1036
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,530
to get charged up or whatever that you

1037
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,880
can check it out like does it look like

1038
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,050
someone's tampered with it is there

1039
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,640
something that's been busted open is

1040
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,840
there any like weird thing with the

1041
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,670
hardware so there's pre-flight checks

1042
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,900
before every single one of these goes

1043
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,490
out right there's physical inspection

1044
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,990
there's software inspection before they

1045
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,580
even go on the road so it's not like

1046
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,170
it's just Yolo and they go wherever they

1047
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:53,180
want like there's a process to make this

1048
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,340
happen right and compare that to a car

1049
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,560
that you just buy from a dealer and the

1050
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,180
dealer sells it to you they may never

1051
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,890
see it again it might be ten years later

1052
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,330
it's still in the road it's never been

1053
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,640
into a shop and you have no idea what's

1054
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,260
going on with it even figure this we

1055
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,119
bricked three head units in the Jeep and

1056
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:09,950
no one knew that we even tried to hack

1057
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,450
it over that period of time right well

1058
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,460
my dealer knew but your dealer did but

1059
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,290
you know as a whole they they didn't

1060
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:17,060
right right if for some reason this car

1061
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,890
comes in and something it's bricked

1062
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,600
we're like well let's let's do an

1063
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,640
investigation this is yeah weird yeah my

1064
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,109
dealer just knew I was having some

1065
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:27,260
serious radio problems sold you lemon I

1066
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,880
know they really did they finally got it

1067
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,859
right on the third time so the other

1068
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:33,140
thing you get from these this the fact

1069
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,030
that we're a ride-sharing service that

1070
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:37,340
owns cars as opposed to selling cars is

1071
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,230
we can monitor where they go all the

1072
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,730
time we can monitor what they're doing

1073
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,290
we can there's something this message is

1074
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,700
constantly saying everything's okay or

1075
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,190
not okay and where you wouldn't

1076
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,570
necessarily want that on a car that you

1077
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,850
bought like I don't want Ford to know

1078
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,200
that I'm driving my Mustang down the

1079
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,869
road or whatever but it's okay in this

1080
00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:56,030
situation because it's you know you

1081
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,410
don't know in the car yeah now I mean we

1082
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:58,790
have to secure these things but at the

1083
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,560
same time when you have a constant

1084
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,270
stream of telemetry information coming

1085
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:05,000
back you know more about what is on the

1086
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,980
car and what's happening in real time

1087
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,410
you could imagine having things like an

1088
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,119
intrusion detection system or true in

1089
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,190
prevention system that's like hey I saw

1090
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,810
some weird-ass these are net frames and

1091
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:18,800
then you can act accordingly so one of

1092
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,880
the most important things about these

1093
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,380
cars since we're not trying to sell

1094
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,029
is we don't have to try to sell all

1095
00:38:23,029 --> 00:38:25,039
these features that security people hate

1096
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,950
and that customers love so you don't

1097
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:31,009
want to like you know you wouldn't sell

1098
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:33,079
car necessarily now that you couldn't

1099
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,609
sync your phone to with Bluetooth

1100
00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:36,410
because like all your competitors are

1101
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,089
doing that so you have to do it but you

1102
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:39,710
can you can take the Bluetooth out of a

1103
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,329
self-driving car because you it's a

1104
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:42,799
self-driving car you don't you're in it

1105
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:43,940
for ten minutes you don't need to sync

1106
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,619
your phone to you can physically remove

1107
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:47,720
a radio chip right like it's not you

1108
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,279
don't even have to do say like oh hey

1109
00:38:49,279 --> 00:38:50,630
let's not have this featured enabled

1110
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,519
like in some cars like you can say

1111
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:54,799
remove the that that five from the board

1112
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:56,690
right and so you get you end up in a

1113
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,700
situation where one of the attacks they

1114
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,380
the one the academics did that just

1115
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,940
can't happen in this car because it

1116
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,809
doesn't even have a Bluetooth chip

1117
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:04,789
anymore so so yeah and you can do that

1118
00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:07,160
same for Wi-Fi or you know the the the

1119
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,109
stock head unit you can just rip that

1120
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:10,609
out because you don't need to be jamming

1121
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:11,630
on your tunes while you're in a

1122
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,150
self-driving car and and at least for

1123
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,229
the time being

1124
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:17,269
these self-driving cars or ride-sharing

1125
00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:19,849
cars right which means they're I think

1126
00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:21,979
were released as that at one point it

1127
00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:23,720
was like the average ride is two miles

1128
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,789
or less right people are gonna be in

1129
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:28,309
these cars for minutes not hours so

1130
00:39:28,309 --> 00:39:29,989
they're not actually too concerned with

1131
00:39:29,989 --> 00:39:31,910
having Bluetooth or any of this other

1132
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:32,960
stuff they kind of just want to get

1133
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,759
where they're going and so we can use

1134
00:39:34,759 --> 00:39:36,319
that like the best thing you can do

1135
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:38,150
instead of trying to secure a Wi-Fi

1136
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,589
stack or secure a Bluetooth stack is

1137
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:41,119
just remove it and then it's definitely

1138
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,279
not gonna have any bugs we we are very

1139
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:45,200
unpopular gentlemen sometimes when we're

1140
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,489
like oh yeah just rip that out like

1141
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:49,729
physically like it rip it out and like a

1142
00:39:49,729 --> 00:39:53,599
customer - I don't want it it's out see

1143
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,460
so that's the basically our job is

1144
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,229
removing code and removing hardware

1145
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,249
that's the biggest thing that we

1146
00:39:58,249 --> 00:40:00,680
contribute to the car we benefit through

1147
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,719
obscurity at this point - now obviously

1148
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:05,420
this isn't you know true security but at

1149
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,309
this given time

1150
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:09,440
you can't go grab one of our cars with

1151
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,880
one of our sensor packages and our

1152
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,650
compute in it only we have those things

1153
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:16,400
it took Charlie and I nine ish months

1154
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,440
with the Jeep and we physically had it

1155
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,880
in our persons and we're kind of

1156
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,940
reversing stuff all day long right now

1157
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,039
this is one of our advantages you can't

1158
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:26,779
go out and grab this car why don't you

1159
00:40:26,779 --> 00:40:28,700
hack an airplane the reason I would hack

1160
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,200
an airplane because I can't get an

1161
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,640
airplane I can't keep airplay in my

1162
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,259
house to figure out how to hack it right

1163
00:40:33,259 --> 00:40:34,200
right and that's

1164
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,390
matter of fact I'm not you know so the

1165
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,980
same applies to this so it's quite what

1166
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,000
you'd read in the press

1167
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,619
you can't just hack something without

1168
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:42,359
ever having seen it and like no matter

1169
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,250
how good you are so the only person I've

1170
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,770
ever seen blind pop something on the

1171
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:49,230
first try was Neil Mehta and this was

1172
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,599
like some weird service and this was

1173
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,730
back when I was at IBM x-force that's

1174
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:54,960
the only time I've witnessed that

1175
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,940
happening and that was before like that

1176
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,510
was before their snack Canaries and

1177
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:02,130
Neil's badass but like that's what I'm

1178
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:04,230
saying it's it's impossible to do this

1179
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,940
if you're just blind right I mean we

1180
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,589
don't rely on this solely it just

1181
00:41:07,589 --> 00:41:09,329
happens to be something that it works in

1182
00:41:09,329 --> 00:41:13,380
our favor so I mean it's it's not all

1183
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,790
happy things like we're talking about

1184
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,349
how easy self-driving car security is

1185
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,089
well it's it's kind of hard to so let's

1186
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:19,109
talk about some of the things that make

1187
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,450
it really hard so we before we talked

1188
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:24,089
about Ethernet and how it's basically

1189
00:41:24,089 --> 00:41:26,670
ubiquitous when it comes to self-driving

1190
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:28,829
cars and probably the modern automobile

1191
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:31,470
the hard part about this right now is

1192
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:36,930
most Ethernet is UDP packets just just

1193
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,640
just hammer as much information across

1194
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,980
the wire as possible that means when you

1195
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,510
talk to a supplier like oh okay we're

1196
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,640
gonna do TLS ensure that communications

1197
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,829
secure we don't even have a TCP stack

1198
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:50,819
and you're like well like we can't

1199
00:41:50,819 --> 00:41:52,500
do TLS you're like oh well can you can

1200
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,670
you do that it's like well we came to

1201
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:56,700
you TCP it's like damn okay the drive

1202
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,319
board that right it's one of those

1203
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,000
things where it evolved out of the

1204
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,430
necessity of bandwidth not out of the

1205
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,470
necessity of kind of security and

1206
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:07,560
integrity so yeah you end up in a

1207
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,349
situation where you could figure out you

1208
00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:12,119
could take the lessons learned in the

1209
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:14,069
corporate world and enterprise world and

1210
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:15,569
say like ok we've got an Ethernet switch

1211
00:42:15,569 --> 00:42:16,859
we know how to secure these things so

1212
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:17,369
let's do it

1213
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:18,930
and then but the very first time you try

1214
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,609
to do something you run into these kind

1215
00:42:20,609 --> 00:42:22,890
of roadblocks that these are not laptops

1216
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,650
these are ECU's that don't do like this

1217
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:28,200
examiner technic even the Linux 802 1x

1218
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,599
client works fairly well but you don't

1219
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,880
even have such things right now in these

1220
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,950
type of components do a search for

1221
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,930
yourself yeah so here's the L dine is

1222
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,819
the biggest manufacturer of lidar so if

1223
00:42:38,819 --> 00:42:40,260
you go to their site and you want to

1224
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,630
know about 802 1 X support for that it

1225
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,430
they don't even talk about it like it

1226
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,200
doesn't exist and then like if you go

1227
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,180
and ask it about TLS suite

1228
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,010
two bits yeah so they actually had TLS

1229
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,450
uh no wait actually what they have

1230
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:53,940
terrestrial laser scanner shade oh well

1231
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,160
how to lock I'm sure that's right it

1232
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,400
sounds rad but rather than TLS actually

1233
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,380
but it doesn't help you when it comes

1234
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,819
time to secure the data that's going

1235
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:04,770
from the lidar to the to the computer

1236
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:08,609
yep so yeah those are a bunch of hard

1237
00:43:08,609 --> 00:43:12,180
things but again we talked about having

1238
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,789
to prioritize this stuff just like in

1239
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:16,980
the corporate or network world you don't

1240
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,299
want to you're not gonna try to chase

1241
00:43:18,299 --> 00:43:20,039
every bug in every flaw down right I'm

1242
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:23,010
sure there are memory corruption flaws

1243
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,260
in image parsers and things like that

1244
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,059
but in reality what are you concerned

1245
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:28,529
with you're concerned with remote

1246
00:43:28,529 --> 00:43:31,400
attacks that can compromise the vehicle

1247
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,380
potentially pivot and physically control

1248
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,710
it like that that is the the the biggest

1249
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,720
kind of fear that we would have that can

1250
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,240
happen and that's how we do our security

1251
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,500
and that's how we model our threats is

1252
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,730
that's what we're really concerned with

1253
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:45,869
yeah if you work in the corporate world

1254
00:43:45,869 --> 00:43:47,160
you're familiar with the fact you don't

1255
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,960
have unlimited resources if you did you

1256
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,760
could secure everything but we have

1257
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,010
finite resources and finite time and so

1258
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:54,510
you have to prioritize where you put

1259
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,190
your efforts and this is our number one

1260
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:56,609
priority

1261
00:43:56,609 --> 00:43:58,920
we don't want an attack that scales to

1262
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,470
the whole fleet and you can do remotely

1263
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,849
and take down every single car at once

1264
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:04,230
like that's the number one thing that we

1265
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:09,630
focused on and make hard number two so

1266
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:11,190
this the second thing we focus on and

1267
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,559
once we have we've devoted enough

1268
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:14,609
resources to that that we feel

1269
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:15,809
comfortable the next thing is we worry

1270
00:44:15,809 --> 00:44:16,049
about

1271
00:44:16,049 --> 00:44:17,579
well remote attacks but you got to be

1272
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:19,049
kind of close and so this is the things

1273
00:44:19,049 --> 00:44:20,430
that we talk about like would Bluetooth

1274
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:23,670
or you know the base station the

1275
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:24,960
malicious base station or something like

1276
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,880
that and so these are still dangerous

1277
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,230
like you don't have to have the car you

1278
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:30,150
don't have to physically touch it but

1279
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,349
you have to at least be nearby so it

1280
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:32,640
doesn't scale to the whole fleet it just

1281
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,619
scales to some location where the bad

1282
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:36,630
guy is and so we worry about this but

1283
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,000
not quite as much and and you know as

1284
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,829
defenders we're familiar with how

1285
00:44:40,829 --> 00:44:42,630
attackers abuse these type of things

1286
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,190
right you can think about this just as

1287
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,900
you would any pen test if your

1288
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,309
consultants write you're gonna look at

1289
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:48,390
Wi-Fi you're gonna look at whatever

1290
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:49,650
radio they have you're gonna look at

1291
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,990
Bluetooth so the reason we definitely

1292
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:53,760
this is second on our priority list is

1293
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,260
because it's kind of known attack

1294
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,210
surface right the cell their vehicle

1295
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,190
stuff is still pretty bespoke there's

1296
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,519
only three groups on the on the plane

1297
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:03,559
have kind of have done that but this

1298
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:06,259
stuff is you know kind of more

1299
00:45:06,259 --> 00:45:10,339
commoditized the next up is physical

1300
00:45:10,339 --> 00:45:12,499
attack so we do care about physical

1301
00:45:12,499 --> 00:45:13,969
attacks because they can affect the car

1302
00:45:13,969 --> 00:45:15,739
but not as much because if you've got a

1303
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:18,349
physically tamper with the car it's

1304
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:19,640
you're more likely to get caught it

1305
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,069
doesn't scale hopefully we can detect

1306
00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:23,899
these things have happened and so this

1307
00:45:23,899 --> 00:45:25,249
is lower on the priority list and

1308
00:45:25,249 --> 00:45:26,599
basically the three ways this could

1309
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:27,979
happen is you could imagine someone

1310
00:45:27,979 --> 00:45:29,929
plugging a device into a port that's in

1311
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:32,779
the car or wiring a device directly into

1312
00:45:32,779 --> 00:45:34,849
a can bus or trying to reflash the

1313
00:45:34,849 --> 00:45:36,979
firmware on devices we have trying to

1314
00:45:36,979 --> 00:45:38,989
become a plus certified on our compute

1315
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:42,469
stack yeah he looks like he already got

1316
00:45:42,469 --> 00:45:45,229
that certification yeah and and the cool

1317
00:45:45,229 --> 00:45:47,029
thing is when you're focusing on the

1318
00:45:47,029 --> 00:45:49,099
remote attacks and the remote aspect a

1319
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:52,369
lot of it is you know authorization and

1320
00:45:52,369 --> 00:45:55,039
integrity issues and these also help

1321
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:56,569
resolve the physical issues right you

1322
00:45:56,569 --> 00:45:59,239
could imagine that certain messages are

1323
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:02,390
signed so they're the only you know the

1324
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:04,159
proper authority can say turn the wheel

1325
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:06,139
of car even if you're physically jacked

1326
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:07,880
in you're not gonna have our signing

1327
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,380
keys and you shouldn't be able to get

1328
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,509
them and therefore that physical attack

1329
00:46:11,509 --> 00:46:15,499
might be kind of moot as well so I

1330
00:46:15,499 --> 00:46:17,149
mentioned this earlier and some of the

1331
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,859
attacks that you hear about in the press

1332
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,049
that get all the headlines are stuff

1333
00:46:21,049 --> 00:46:22,609
that we actually don't care about so

1334
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:25,369
there's this one this article about like

1335
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:27,949
oh by putting tape on stop signs you can

1336
00:46:27,949 --> 00:46:29,359
trick self-driving cars into not

1337
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,929
stopping wrong right wrong so this is an

1338
00:46:32,929 --> 00:46:34,699
example of if a reporter would have

1339
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:35,929
asked us we'd have said this is stupid

1340
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:37,519
and then they wouldn't have quoted us

1341
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:38,659
and then the article still what it came

1342
00:46:38,659 --> 00:46:40,489
out exactly like this

1343
00:46:40,489 --> 00:46:43,489
but the point is that the way that their

1344
00:46:43,489 --> 00:46:45,829
attack worked is they were using like

1345
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:47,539
the camera would see the thing and use

1346
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:49,849
OCR to figure out what it said and now

1347
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,259
they think it says love or something

1348
00:46:51,259 --> 00:46:52,729
instead of stop I don't know why there

1349
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:54,949
would be a love sign up but anyway we'll

1350
00:46:54,949 --> 00:46:57,169
have to stop baby love it so there's so

1351
00:46:57,169 --> 00:46:58,909
the point is that the the subject cars

1352
00:46:58,909 --> 00:47:00,469
don't do that self-driving cars don't

1353
00:47:00,469 --> 00:47:03,619
take you know camera images and try to

1354
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:05,419
parse out the signs from the image

1355
00:47:05,419 --> 00:47:06,439
that's not the way they work the way

1356
00:47:06,439 --> 00:47:07,969
they work is they have a detailed map

1357
00:47:07,969 --> 00:47:10,759
the map says where the stop signs are no

1358
00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:12,409
matter what you put on the stop sign you

1359
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:14,299
tear the stop sign down car still going

1360
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:15,269
to stop because it knows

1361
00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:16,649
was a stop signs supposed to be there

1362
00:47:16,649 --> 00:47:17,880
because it's on the map it doesn't even

1363
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,679
look for a stop sign just knows where

1364
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:21,689
the stop signs are another thing to

1365
00:47:21,689 --> 00:47:25,559
realize too is yes these cars do machine

1366
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:28,679
learning right but how do you train

1367
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,459
those machine learning models you have

1368
00:47:31,459 --> 00:47:35,279
hundreds if not thousands of labelers so

1369
00:47:35,279 --> 00:47:36,539
when I said they're out mapping those

1370
00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:37,799
Street taking pictures and everything

1371
00:47:37,799 --> 00:47:39,449
everything that the machine learning

1372
00:47:39,449 --> 00:47:41,939
engine can't figure out you physically

1373
00:47:41,939 --> 00:47:43,949
sent a person there are rooms full of

1374
00:47:43,949 --> 00:47:46,339
people at uber at cruise at way mo

1375
00:47:46,339 --> 00:47:49,049
clicking saying yes that is a stop sign

1376
00:47:49,049 --> 00:47:52,380
yes that is a bicycle so again it's not

1377
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,630
just hey take a picture of some sign and

1378
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:56,880
we think it's a stop sign like they're

1379
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,189
the machine learning models they use are

1380
00:47:59,189 --> 00:48:01,559
heavily groomed and take thousands of

1381
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:03,899
man-hours to do so again it's not just

1382
00:48:03,899 --> 00:48:06,239
some open-source software package you're

1383
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:07,589
good and it works like there's a lot of

1384
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:08,999
work involved basically the theme of

1385
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:10,559
this talk is we just rain on all other

1386
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,349
research that's not a first but here's

1387
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:14,759
another one that we want to rain on so

1388
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:16,019
we already talked about this a bit so

1389
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:17,999
it's like I'll Jam the GPS and crash all

1390
00:48:17,999 --> 00:48:19,439
the self-driving cars I already said

1391
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:21,419
self-driving cars don't use GPS they use

1392
00:48:21,419 --> 00:48:23,399
localization so Jam all you want doesn't

1393
00:48:23,399 --> 00:48:26,849
matter exactly yeah these cars no you

1394
00:48:26,849 --> 00:48:28,139
know like we said up to the centimeter

1395
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:29,609
where they're going so as long as they

1396
00:48:29,609 --> 00:48:30,749
know where they're at when they start

1397
00:48:30,749 --> 00:48:33,209
you don't need anything it just kind of

1398
00:48:33,209 --> 00:48:34,469
knows it has this map and it can drive

1399
00:48:34,469 --> 00:48:35,789
around it can go to point A and point B

1400
00:48:35,789 --> 00:48:37,289
right so maybe someday in the future

1401
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:40,199
that would be a deal for a like KITT but

1402
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:41,909
it's not a deal for self-driving cars at

1403
00:48:41,909 --> 00:48:44,939
level four all right so let's talk about

1404
00:48:44,939 --> 00:48:47,669
what we do and the sort of defense that

1405
00:48:47,669 --> 00:48:49,259
we build into self-driving cars to

1406
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,029
secure them right so we care a lot about

1407
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:53,609
that and we spend every day trying to do

1408
00:48:53,609 --> 00:48:55,829
it and these are sort of the some of the

1409
00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:58,259
the approaches that we use to try to

1410
00:48:58,259 --> 00:49:00,599
defend I think the the biggest one that

1411
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:02,189
we really try to do and this is probably

1412
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,139
because Charlie and I have spent most of

1413
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:05,939
our career on the opposite side of the

1414
00:49:05,939 --> 00:49:08,789
table breaking stuff is reducing a stack

1415
00:49:08,789 --> 00:49:10,769
surface we know for sure that we can't

1416
00:49:10,769 --> 00:49:12,749
write secure software yet we know for

1417
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,399
sure we can't make secure Hardware

1418
00:49:14,399 --> 00:49:16,289
because we've made careers out of break

1419
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:18,539
in that stuff so what's the best method

1420
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,789
to secure this remove it if you don't

1421
00:49:20,789 --> 00:49:22,589
need that software off if you don't need

1422
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:24,599
the hardware kill it right this is

1423
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:27,029
probably the the biggest thing that we

1424
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:28,500
do because

1425
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,300
we know that if it's removed it's

1426
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,280
actually more secure yeah the next thing

1427
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,720
we do is we make sure that the code that

1428
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,859
is running on all the computers in the

1429
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:36,720
car is really our code and we use a

1430
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,940
secure boot for that verified boot and

1431
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,010
so we make sure that the the code that's

1432
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:43,170
running is cryptographically signed only

1433
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:45,270
we can do that and so this makes sure

1434
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:46,800
that it hasn't been tampered with or

1435
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,369
that no one else can can reflash it if

1436
00:49:50,369 --> 00:49:51,960
you saw in all three attacks what

1437
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,869
happened all three attackers us the you

1438
00:49:54,869 --> 00:49:56,400
wash and the keying team we had to

1439
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,130
reprogram something with code signing a

1440
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:01,410
verification any bit modified to that

1441
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,150
code would fail right and it wouldn't be

1442
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:05,160
be flashed not to say that that would

1443
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,560
completely prevent us from figuring out

1444
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,560
a way to execute code and you know not

1445
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,720
all verified boot implementations are

1446
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,240
flawless but it makes it much much more

1447
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,040
difficult right so if fiat-chrysler

1448
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,200
would have had code signing on that

1449
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,540
gateway chip when we were attacking the

1450
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:22,859
jeep we probably would have never gotten

1451
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:24,720
passing I remember we had that bug

1452
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,579
though I know but I'm pretty lazy I

1453
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:28,589
don't know he would have got it we

1454
00:50:28,589 --> 00:50:31,050
wouldn't have so we wouldn't we wouldn't

1455
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:34,829
have anyway the point is it would have

1456
00:50:34,829 --> 00:50:36,990
been so much harder that if we couldn't

1457
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:38,250
just reprogram that chip with no

1458
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,780
security at all but if they would have

1459
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:40,950
had code signing it would have been we

1460
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:42,150
probably would have had a black hat

1461
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:44,430
talked about how we almost made the car

1462
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:45,839
move yeah well we would know we do have

1463
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,210
black guy talking like 20/20 about how

1464
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,609
we've hacked the 2014 Jeep so it would

1465
00:50:50,609 --> 00:50:53,460
have been delayed many years oops I

1466
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,339
forgot that's all ones like that yeah

1467
00:50:56,339 --> 00:50:57,839
key storage for things like that like I

1468
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,960
said identity identity and authorization

1469
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,109
for these type of things is paramount we

1470
00:51:04,109 --> 00:51:06,060
want to ensure that messages that

1471
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,920
control the vehicle that physically

1472
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,869
control it are actually signed by the

1473
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:11,670
proper authorities and verified on the

1474
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:15,420
other end again we've we've pulled keys

1475
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,920
out of hardware before we've pulled keys

1476
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,599
out of software so we want to make sure

1477
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:21,690
that a lot of these devices that we're

1478
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:23,250
using have things like hardware security

1479
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,770
modules or tpms right so we can have

1480
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:28,650
some some anchor some trust anchor in

1481
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:30,329
there so we can sign things and verify

1482
00:51:30,329 --> 00:51:31,349
them without having to worry about

1483
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:33,540
someone grabbing our vehicle ripping one

1484
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,859
of these out and having our keys forever

1485
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:37,740
yeah and so next thing encryption that's

1486
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,300
a no-brainer we encrypt the data when it

1487
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,369
leaves a car we encrypt what we can on

1488
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:41,650
the

1489
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:44,339
so if it gets stolen we don't lose that

1490
00:51:44,339 --> 00:51:46,720
code sign we already mentioned so any

1491
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,880
code that we download any updates have

1492
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,750
to be signed

1493
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,430
make sure it's legitimate so we don't

1494
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:53,380
just accepting code blindly up I think I

1495
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:56,529
message met mentioned message signing

1496
00:51:56,529 --> 00:51:59,020
several times but I think one of the key

1497
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,670
pieces that's lacking now and we're

1498
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:03,309
spending a fair amount of effort on is

1499
00:52:03,309 --> 00:52:05,980
threat detection we know again as

1500
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,230
attackers that there's really no such

1501
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:10,779
thing as an unhackable system we make

1502
00:52:10,779 --> 00:52:13,359
careers out of doing that but we do want

1503
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,130
to know if something is astray and the

1504
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:17,950
good part about these networks while

1505
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:20,589
there are similar to your corporate data

1506
00:52:20,589 --> 00:52:23,410
centers they're dissimilar in we know

1507
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:24,730
what traffic will be there there's not

1508
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:27,010
users browsing the web right even though

1509
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,319
Ethernet traffic is there it's standard

1510
00:52:29,319 --> 00:52:30,970
we know what we should expect and if we

1511
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:33,250
see things that stray from that we can

1512
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,869
at least raise a flag all right so a

1513
00:52:34,869 --> 00:52:36,430
bunch of computers that we design

1514
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:38,680
talking to each other in a very standard

1515
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,140
predictable way and so attacks things

1516
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,000
that are unusual things like we did in

1517
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,770
the Jeep really stand out so it's pretty

1518
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:46,089
easy to detect that something weirds

1519
00:52:46,089 --> 00:52:50,970
going on let's wrap it up wrap it up be

1520
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:55,450
as you see right now there there have

1521
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:57,579
been very few instances of remote

1522
00:52:57,579 --> 00:53:00,369
attacks the cars for physical control

1523
00:53:00,369 --> 00:53:02,650
that being said we're super concerned

1524
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:05,079
with it because it and deals entails

1525
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:09,339
passenger safety and driverless cars

1526
00:53:09,339 --> 00:53:11,289
kind of make some things easier because

1527
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:13,089
we have some liberties that most

1528
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:14,289
coroner's don't they come home every day

1529
00:53:14,289 --> 00:53:16,240
and some things harder because you know

1530
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,650
there are no steering wheels and they

1531
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:19,029
are more complex and there's a lot more

1532
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,609
to review alright and and so like if

1533
00:53:21,609 --> 00:53:24,250
you're a researcher out there like the

1534
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,630
reason we release our tools and we wrote

1535
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:26,859
a bunch of papers is we want to get

1536
00:53:26,859 --> 00:53:29,710
people involved so continue continue

1537
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:32,549
hacking stuff break cars write papers

1538
00:53:32,549 --> 00:53:34,960
release all your information so everyone

1539
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,910
can learn from it right I mean we've had

1540
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:38,710
many times where people came up to us

1541
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,329
were like hey thanks for leaves and all

1542
00:53:40,329 --> 00:53:42,279
those papers now my department has more

1543
00:53:42,279 --> 00:53:45,430
budget at car company to not be named

1544
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,490
right so it's cool we want people to do

1545
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:50,020
that when we've only looked at a few

1546
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,430
cars we want people to look at a bunch

1547
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:52,900
of cars so then we can have you have

1548
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,930
even more data points and even think of

1549
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:56,549
the overall security all these vehicles

1550
00:53:56,549 --> 00:53:58,740
in a better fashion yeah when we hacked

1551
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,210
a car we didn't want to be the car

1552
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:01,859
hackers forever we wanted to be like

1553
00:54:01,859 --> 00:54:03,630
those guys who hacked the car along with

1554
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:05,369
like the 50 other people who hacked cars

1555
00:54:05,369 --> 00:54:07,920
and it helped find bugs and that sort of

1556
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,500
thing so keep it up with that being said

1557
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,569
thanks for sticking around thanks for

1558
00:54:12,569 --> 00:54:13,920
countermeasure for having us we had a

1559
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,400
blast

1560
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,619
[Applause]

1561
