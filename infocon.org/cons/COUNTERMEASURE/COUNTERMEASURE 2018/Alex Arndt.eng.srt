[Music]

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,150
morning everyone as introduced my name

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,220
is Max Warren officer Alex aren't I'm a

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,740
member of the Keene Armed Forces I

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,119
actually work at the Canadian Forces

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,460
Network Operations Center and I'm here

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,990
today to talk to you about the evolution

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,050
of Canaria Forces cyber operations now

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,789
some of you may have been here a year

10
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,300
ago when I presented on the implications

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,260
of strong secure engaged and cyber for

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,460
the Canadian Armed Forces

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,489
so this slide decks gonna kind of do a

14
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:44,430
couple of things one it's gonna kind of

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,590
leapfrog off of mister Boucher's talk

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,600
about the center and kind of explain

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,129
where we're gonna fit into all of this

18
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,640
now that this big pan government

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,180
organization exists for IT security and

20
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,230
I'm also going to provide a bit of an

21
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,979
update of where we are against strong

22
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,869
secure engaged in terms of the cyber

23
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:10,670
related initiatives so here's my

24
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,080
presentation outline today I'm gonna

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,580
talk about the center notice it's in

26
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,580
quotes I'll explain that in a bit talk

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,830
about where we fit in evolution I'm

28
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,020
going to kind of explain the difference

29
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,570
between information technology security

30
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,030
and defensive cyber operations and

31
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,930
there's probably some of you sitting

32
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,079
here going there's a difference I hope

33
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,400
to make that clear by the end of my

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,000
slide down so just a quick slide about

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,880
me I'm the senior side Robert Nek in

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,560
armed forces so one of the things strong

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,049
secure engage did for us was we created

38
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,360
a new occupation entirely focused on

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,509
cyber for the Keeney Armed Forces I'm

40
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,670
the senior operator even though I've

41
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,979
only been a member of this trade for

42
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,229
just a little over a year that's how new

43
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:58,049
we are I've got quite a bit of cyber

44
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:59,880
experience that's all I'm really going

45
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,670
to talk about on that slide so the

46
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,979
center or the Canadian Center for cyber

47
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,330
security so what well we know that it

48
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,770
was announced in January of this year

49
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,010
and we know that it's part of the

50
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,230
the big strategy that was released by

51
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,599
the government and what it does is it

52
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,270
brings us a center that's focused on

53
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,810
three key areas and this is just like

54
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,450
what mr. Boucher talked about security

55
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,390
resilience cyber innovation leadership

56
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:36,870
in collaboration the center brings three

57
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,850
organizations together to provide this

58
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,410
leadership now I found it interesting

59
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,090
mr. Boucher didn't really touch on this

60
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,290
and there's probably some of you in this

61
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,730
room that already know what I'm about to

62
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,769
say but there's three key players

63
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:48,030
they've been brought together to deal

64
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,060
with IT security for the government and

65
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,140
that is CCS IT security branch shared

66
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,209
services Canada's Security Operations

67
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,110
Center and Public Safety's government

68
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,180
cyber Incident Response Center and their

69
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,799
get cyber safety that's quite a bit of

70
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:09,239
capability that's all been put together

71
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,069
under one roof and under the leadership

72
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:12,959
of mr. Boucher as the Director of

73
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,620
Operations and it it's got quite a broad

74
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,840
area of responsibility all IT security

75
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,600
is a broad area of concern right there's

76
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,370
a lot going on there if any of you have

77
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,940
done adding with the SIS body of

78
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,739
knowledge you know that it's about this

79
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,650
wide and about this deep and in some

80
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,090
ways that's what this organization is

81
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,850
trying to deal with the cool thing is is

82
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,880
that the information technology security

83
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,440
functions are consolidated in one

84
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,690
integrated team and those functions are

85
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,760
defensive the government of Canada's

86
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,239
Systems Expert advice and guidance again

87
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,790
this is a bit of a you know a repeat of

88
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,410
what mr. Boucher said and trust me I'm

89
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,690
getting onto the better stuff threat

90
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,079
assessments in reporting coordinated

91
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,370
Incident Response and this one's

92
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,519
important because as mr. Boucher alluded

93
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,660
to they don't want to just deal with

94
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,090
government they want to deal with

95
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,440
critical infrastructure protection and

96
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,930
you know helping industry as a whole and

97
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,930
you know the idea of collective defence

98
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,180
that he put forth is a very important

99
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,829
one secure solutions and services'

100
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,250
cybersecurity training education

101
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,300
interesting point

102
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,330
safety is still the organization within

103
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,440
the Government of Canada who's

104
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,900
responsible for information technology

105
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,069
security policy something to think about

106
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,099
because policy drives everything I mean

107
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:43,740
where I work I'm in the military so

108
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,449
policy is everything for us if we don't

109
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:48,210
have a regulation or a rule or some kind

110
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,159
of an order to tell us what to do we

111
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,610
have no authorities to do anything and

112
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,259
by extension you know policy of this

113
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,990
nature is required to guide the

114
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,729
government in to guide all the folks

115
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:01,830
involved in this effort on what they can

116
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,990
and cannot do those red lines that mr.

117
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,840
Boucher talked about but public safety

118
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,720
remains solely responsible for policy

119
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,229
that's not meant as a commentary or some

120
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,669
kind of a judgement on that it's just

121
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:16,729
it's a key highlight

122
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:19,830
so Kenny air forces integration into the

123
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,690
center and I'm using the center because

124
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,219
it's it's a lot easier to say than the

125
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:25,530
mouthful of Canadian Center for

126
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,849
cybersecurity i we have one defense of

127
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:31,530
cyber unit the Canadian Forces right now

128
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,240
as the unit I'm a member of the Canadian

129
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,039
Forces Network operations and her sift

130
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,280
knock historically SIF knock has

131
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,710
performed IT security functions for the

132
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,330
Department of National Defense and the

133
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,430
Canadian Armed Forces from our inception

134
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:51,060
in 2003 until now ish because we're in a

135
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,789
transition period we were delivering the

136
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:56,940
IT security program in partnership with

137
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,370
some other folks for the department and

138
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,520
the Armed Forces

139
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,529
we had partners to do this some of you

140
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:05,909
in this room may even work for some of

141
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:08,340
these folks and this year I have less

142
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,900
familiar faces than I had last year but

143
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,159
that's okay

144
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:13,169
you've got Defense Information

145
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:16,590
Management engineering and integration

146
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,050
you've got Director of Information

147
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,360
Management security and then you've

148
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,800
gotten our information system security

149
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,259
officers there they're the main partners

150
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,440
in what we do so Isis is I think that's

151
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,360
that's somewhat self-evident somewhat

152
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,550
self-explanatory it this is the person

153
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,039
in an organization who is the pointy end

154
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,539
of the stick when something happens that

155
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,060
people are supposed to tell I got a

156
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,800
weird email today it might be a fish

157
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,759
attack what do I do and hopefully the

158
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,389
ISIS Oh was well versed and sorts it out

159
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,340
and most of them are especially in our

160
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,620
department and then they get a hold of

161
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,539
us after telling the user to just delete

162
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,750
it and they let us know what's going on

163
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,099
if it's something more serious like a

164
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:01,470
breach whatever again Isis those are

165
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,449
kind of that frontline worker and what

166
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:06,569
we try to do dur I am secure their

167
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:08,750
responsibility is that that

168
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,069
certification accreditation process or

169
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:13,319
what we're now calling si na I'm making

170
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,419
sure that you know audits and people are

171
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,789
compliant with direction and best

172
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:20,669
practices and then dimy they're the

173
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:23,550
folks engineering all the the solutions

174
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,960
that help make things happen so that's

175
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,530
firewalls or host beast protective

176
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,009
measures like EDR they're the folks that

177
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:34,229
are doing all that that research and

178
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:39,449
development and deployment so SIF Knox

179
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:40,949
obviously still got a role to play in IT

180
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:44,099
security even though I'm here to talk

181
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,919
about its evolution where we're gonna

182
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,330
make sure that we work with the center

183
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,610
we have a person who's integrated in the

184
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,789
center actually it's it's part of what

185
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:55,440
came with the center or became part of

186
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,000
the center that person that we have is

187
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,500
still integrated there and is still part

188
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,159
of the reporting lines helps us keep our

189
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:04,800
our finger on the pulse of the big hand

190
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,409
small map information technology

191
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:10,979
security concerns we're all aware of the

192
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,139
trends right now I mean again I'm gonna

193
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,729
sound almost like I'm repeating mr.

194
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,940
Boucher but it bears repeating

195
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:22,500
ransomware organized crime now we're all

196
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,150
these things that are whacking our

197
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,729
networks on a day to day basis mostly

198
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:29,159
unsuccessful I thank goodness but you

199
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:30,270
know they're out there and they're a

200
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,849
threat and even something as simple as a

201
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:35,370
phishing email if it bears the right

202
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,559
thing and it can be an absolute bad day

203
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,969
at the office we all know this

204
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:41,309
I've these are things we need to know

205
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:44,670
what's going on so that we can make sure

206
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,899
we're looking for the right things at

207
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,199
the right time and it's all about

208
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:53,649
efficiencies and responsiveness but the

209
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,809
Center is going to be the the main

210
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,730
organization responsible for this stuff

211
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,649
across the government and that will

212
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:01,990
include D and D because shared services

213
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,410
Canada as part of their sock is

214
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,350
responsible for IT security on DD

215
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,649
networks below the classified level so

216
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:14,769
our internet connected and and intranet

217
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:17,110
or dewayne as some of you may know it

218
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,600
that stuff's all shared services Canada

219
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,360
is responsibility not ours we don't

220
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,860
manage it we don't even have admin

221
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,889
credentials on it anymore so it's really

222
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:29,350
important to understand that there's a

223
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,730
responsibility that now lies with

224
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,089
somebody else so some of you might be

225
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:35,139
going but wait a minute aren't you

226
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:37,629
giving up your ground are you not giving

227
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:39,429
up here and last year I use this term

228
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:41,350
and I'm gonna use it again key cyber

229
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,160
terrain yes and no and this is where the

230
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,939
evolution starts to get talked about we

231
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:52,029
get to evolve towards defensive cyber

232
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:55,230
operations instead of IT security and

233
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,029
again it's well don't you use the same

234
00:09:58,029 --> 00:09:59,709
things you've got the firewalls and the

235
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:01,379
IDS's and the EDR and all these

236
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:03,699
countermeasures and monitoring tools and

237
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:06,339
best practices yes

238
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,769
but the fundamental difference is the

239
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:11,769
focus so the mission of the Canadian

240
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:14,350
Forces Network Operations Center is to

241
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,749
gain and maintain cyber superiority to

242
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,429
allow Supporter commanders freedom of

243
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:20,920
movement in our cyber environment that

244
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,209
is our raise on debt that is what we do

245
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:29,110
it sounds very far-reaching but as I

246
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,540
explained this evolution it makes a lot

247
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,399
more sense now than it ever did

248
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,749
even though we've been using this since

249
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:39,069
we stood up we conduct defensive cyber

250
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:42,490
operations on behalf of the Keene army

251
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,160
he the the Royal Canadian Navy the Royal

252
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,470
Canadian Air Force and anybody else

253
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,769
who's using D&D and calf networks where

254
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:52,509
we are transitioning where this focus

255
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:54,129
shift is occurring is that instead of us

256
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:57,759
trying to do it all from Halifax does

257
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,679
climb alt and alert to Toronto we are

258
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,990
now focusing on those operations and

259
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,579
those networks that support those

260
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:07,400
operations

261
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,880
are critical to commanders deployed and

262
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,170
conducting operations either

263
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,440
domestically or internationally so

264
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,780
instead of trying to secure it all we're

265
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,760
securing those key pieces of the network

266
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,180
or that key cyber terrain to ensure

267
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,520
those commanders can conduct their

268
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,470
missions and have their their means so

269
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,270
this is not unlike if it was a radio net

270
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,070
we're making sure that they're doing

271
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,570
what they need to do and that they have

272
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,480
the the awareness and the information

273
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,480
they need including intelligence to use

274
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,190
their radio nets to the best effect

275
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,570
without being denied those nets so any

276
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,860
of you with any familiarity in

277
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,120
electronic warfare know that there's

278
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,320
things like jamming and other attacks

279
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,290
and their spoofing all the same concepts

280
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,080
that occur in electronic warfare very

281
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,000
applicable to dissent defense of cyber

282
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,670
operations and a kind of a high-level

283
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:04,880
concept so last year when I briefed

284
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,710
defensive cyber operations there were

285
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,330
two definitions that were given and I'm

286
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,070
gonna repeat one of them because it is

287
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,660
the one that matters for what we do

288
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,140
today

289
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,330
there was defense of cyber operations

290
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,970
internal defensive measures and there

291
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,580
was defensive cyber operations reaction

292
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,430
or reactive actions we do not do our a

293
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,950
DC o our a is something that happens on

294
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:31,490
a piece of cyber terrain or in other

295
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,850
words a network that you don't own

296
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,710
that's bordering on offensive actions

297
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,690
that that's that active piece that

298
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,340
that's been talked about and shared and

299
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,460
strong secure engaged and the policy

300
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,160
space has not evolved yet last year I

301
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,340
talked about how there's key legislation

302
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,470
that's currently in consideration but

303
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,940
has not gone through that that would

304
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,950
enable things that enables our partners

305
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,700
like CSE to do some stuff we don't yet

306
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,620
have that that green light so active

307
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,500
remains a an aspiration as opposed to an

308
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,580
ability right now so IDM is what we do

309
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,420
and that internal defensive work

310
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,160
internal defensive measures so that's

311
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,290
that that sounds an awful lot like IT

312
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,660
security again the big difference

313
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,070
between an IT security program and

314
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,790
see Oh IDM is that we are doing it

315
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,140
specifically in support of given things

316
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,190
and I'll give an example

317
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,730
so as many of you know Canada has

318
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,050
committed to supporting the United

319
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,430
Nations through up presence in Malley

320
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,900
hypothetically and it is entirely

321
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,690
hypothetically if there was a network

322
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,990
deployed in support of that operation

323
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,000
that there was a threat against it would

324
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,830
be our job to identify what those

325
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,130
threats might be identify the possible

326
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,750
countermeasures that should be deployed

327
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,990
to protect it and then provide all that

328
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,780
monitoring and reaction and response to

329
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,310
things that occur on that network so

330
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,530
that becomes a piece of key cyber train

331
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,810
that we're responsible for securing we

332
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,750
perform some work on it and we keep the

333
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,210
commander informed of what this piece of

334
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,730
cyber ground is like on any given day so

335
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,210
just like what we call maneuver warfare

336
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,300
is supported through intelligence and

337
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,040
various enablers like engineers and

338
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,360
electronic warfare and stuff to make

339
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,010
sure that the piece of ground the

340
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,530
commander is responsible for is secure

341
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,550
its surveyed it is managed same thing

342
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,200
only now it's cyber train or a network

343
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,210
so there's the definition of defense of

344
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,830
cyber operations I am NOT going to flog

345
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,800
this horse you can read it for yourself

346
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,560
but as you can see it it has a an IT

347
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,780
security flavor and this is this is kind

348
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,800
of motherhood and apple pie for us but

349
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,650
it the important thing is is that it is

350
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:00,010
not an enterprise-wide effort it is

351
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,180
focused it is deliberate in fact the the

352
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,860
big phrase we're using these days is

353
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,320
deliberately planned and that's because

354
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,660
you can't you while you deliberately

355
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,460
plan an IT security program between

356
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,550
procurement and deployment and just all

357
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,320
the people all the stakeholders involved

358
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,850
that kind of a program will take months

359
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,280
if not years to implement I mean we've

360
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,970
been doing IT security in some sense in

361
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,980
the department for more than 20 years

362
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,720
and there's still lots of room for

363
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,130
improvement like there is in any

364
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,560
organization because this this battle

365
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,090
space as we refer to it in the middle in

366
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:34,290
the

367
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,779
military context is ever-evolving the

368
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,779
threat ever is always changing and it's

369
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:42,630
it's like the most complicated game of

370
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,120
cat-and-mouse right it's if you think

371
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,449
that I've done this this and this and my

372
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:50,250
certification or crashed Haitians been

373
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,069
signed off so I'm good to go I'm done

374
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:55,560
you're not doing yourself any justice or

375
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,930
your shareholders any justice from an IT

376
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,130
security perspective

377
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,079
likewise for us from a supportive

378
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,240
commander perspective if we just put

379
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,860
some things out hit the tick boxes and

380
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,380
go yep checklist complete

381
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,620
we're not doing defensive cyber ops and

382
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,319
there's the textbook definition for IDM

383
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:17,880
and of course I will be open for some

384
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,910
questions at the end if anybody has any

385
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,860
so quote from the commander of CFI OG or

386
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,029
the Canadian Forces information

387
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:26,459
Operations Group my boss's boss if you

388
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,470
will or I guess my boss's boss's boss

389
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,620
but whatever

390
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,670
Canadian Forces Network Operations

391
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,560
Center of role is not to be another

392
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,930
layer in the IT security it is to defend

393
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,430
and defeat our adversaries in this

394
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,959
battle space in this battle space being

395
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:43,380
cyber so even the commander the person

396
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,510
who tells us what we're supposed to do

397
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,310
has made it very clear that we're not

398
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,410
here to do IT security for the

399
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,120
department we are here to do defensive

400
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,149
cyber operations and it's it's this

401
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:57,089
directive this direction that that has

402
00:16:57,089 --> 00:16:58,860
started the evolution that we are

403
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,449
currently embarked upon so now this so

404
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:05,609
what of my presentation he keeps talking

405
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,140
about IT security keeps talking about

406
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,069
DCO what's the difference this is IT

407
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:14,609
security really high level quick and

408
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:17,130
dirty a few key points right it's

409
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,409
information assurance threat agnostic

410
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:21,179
vulnerability focused it's all about

411
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,390
compliance and best practices and it's

412
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,909
industry standards so it's the stuff

413
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:30,059
that makes most of us have work on any

414
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:36,690
given day here's the difference it's all

415
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,030
about mission assurance for us and I'm

416
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,860
gonna segue off into mission assurance

417
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,900
in a sec because there's kind of two

418
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,500
flavors of that adversary focus so again

419
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,030
it is not about

420
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,000
your terrain and what its risks are in

421
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,850
terms of the say for example the top 10

422
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,950
that's not what this is about it's about

423
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,830
is somebody actively targeting is

424
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,440
somebody actively conducting offensive

425
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,510
cyber operations against a piece of key

426
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:07,250
cyber trained I its command and control

427
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,890
these nets just like radios are part of

428
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,780
the command and control infrastructure

429
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,700
for a commander this is how they make

430
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,289
decisions because they get information

431
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:19,230
from it and then how they give orders by

432
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,510
sending that information across it it's

433
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:25,500
also how intelligence is shared and it's

434
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,380
all about movement and maneuver even our

435
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,530
ground forces in combat vehicles have

436
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:35,130
digital connectivity and comms non-voice

437
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,730
in their in their equipment right now so

438
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,909
if they can't trust that network and the

439
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:44,070
information that's on it we have a

440
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,010
mission problem so the key focus here is

441
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,360
making sure that the mission is

442
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,419
supported the mission is secure and that

443
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:53,970
they can trust that network in support

444
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,770
of that given mission so that's a much

445
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,350
smaller piece of the overall

446
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,880
infrastructure or the overall enterprise

447
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,980
that we have to worry about of course

448
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,960
we're doing it for a bunch of operations

449
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,240
so there's some concurrence but it's

450
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,840
better than doing the whole thing if I

451
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,280
just accidentally lays somebody I

452
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,200
apologize I hit the wrong button

453
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,570
so how is SIF not changed so SIF NOC is

454
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,240
organized on some lines of effort and

455
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,130
much of what you see on this slide right

456
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,260
now is a direct result of what happened

457
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,200
when SIF NOC was built in 2003 it was it

458
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,210
was very much an IT security focused

459
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,970
organization following the very trends

460
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,039
at the time it had both Network service

461
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,950
delivery and network security integrated

462
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,950
into one team and you had your network

463
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,140
operations you're the central attendant

464
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,580
service that's believe it or not that

465
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,159
was our phone operators so that's so you

466
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:49,740
know to connect your call please provide

467
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,960
a local that kind of thing

468
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,140
integral IT support that's charlie

469
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,789
squadron for the folks in the room that

470
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:58,470
are from safe NOC I'm Mike

471
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,250
and then our technical

472
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,490
site inspection folk excuse me folks and

473
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,560
our defense of cyber operations in its

474
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,890
handling teams and for in case of DC oh

475
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,540
that that's all the functions you would

476
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,850
expect that's what we call surveillance

477
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,730
what you would call your your IDs team

478
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,430
perhaps or your the folks that are

479
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,530
looking at your logs and doing all your

480
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,990
event correlation using the siem to get

481
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,190
the job done that includes the the

482
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,690
reconnaissance team or you know network

483
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,210
vulnerability analysis folks and it even

484
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,120
involves the our red teamer or the

485
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,700
threat emulation folks i think that's

486
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,680
again fairly self-explanatory

487
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,820
well decision was made in order to

488
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:50,010
enable this evolve Minh to to help focus

489
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:53,730
if not more we're splitting off all that

490
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,220
service delivery stuff no more about

491
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,380
there blinking lights it's not it's not

492
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,160
what we're here for

493
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,260
the network links is somebody else's

494
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,820
problem now and in this case it's seven

495
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,350
Communications Group and away they go so

496
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,750
now those organizations those pieces of

497
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,040
the organization have been given to

498
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,350
somebody else now network service

499
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,210
delivery and network availability is a

500
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,150
different organization still a partner

501
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:21,150
but not our not our circus and on our

502
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:26,160
monkeys if you will so SIF NOC evolution

503
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,440
we've talked about it Venn diagram very

504
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,120
helpful rate how much of these circles

505
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,370
overlapped I would argue that for from

506
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,270
2003 until 2017 those circles were

507
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,250
pretty much one on top of another very

508
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:42,570
close to it as we move towards DCO IDM

509
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,600
and and deliberately planned defensive

510
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,400
cyber operations in support of deployed

511
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,300
and domestic operations in Canada and

512
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,910
abroad it's very much more towards the

513
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:58,560
right that the circles are separating so

514
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,310
I'm gonna actually I'll back up because

515
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,800
I said I was going to talk about mission

516
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,530
assurance so mission assurance some of

517
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,460
you in this room are going mission

518
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,720
assurance doesn't that mean something

519
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,390
else for those of you that paid

520
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,340
attention to strong secure engaged and

521
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,779
one of the initiatives that I'm not

522
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:18,419
discussing today but I did discuss last

523
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:19,799
year it talked about a mission assurance

524
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:23,099
program so assuring the mission from a

525
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:25,109
defensive cyber operations standpoint is

526
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:28,409
those deliberate actions that DCO eidm

527
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:33,299
stuff mission assurance is more platform

528
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:35,879
centric so what I say platform I don't

529
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:37,469
mean the thing I'm standing on obviously

530
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:39,379
and I'm sorry if I'm being pedantic but

531
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:41,369
platforms in our cases things like

532
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:43,590
aircraft and ships and armored fighting

533
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,869
vehicles the digital infrastructure in

534
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:47,599
each one of those pieces of equipment

535
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,580
represent an attack surface and in an

536
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,369
extreme scenario if that attack surface

537
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:54,989
results in the vehicle being somehow

538
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:57,119
compromised and even worse if a weapon

539
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,219
system can be exploited remotely by a

540
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:03,559
non friendly actor or having a bad day

541
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:05,639
now I'm not seeing any of those things

542
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:07,559
exist but this is what mission assurance

543
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,479
is about mission assurance is a

544
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:11,789
engineering activity that takes place

545
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:13,710
during procurement and development that

546
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:18,570
ensures that the risks are minimized and

547
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,989
any residual risk is mitigated so this

548
00:23:21,989 --> 00:23:24,089
is this is more of a assistant deputy

549
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:26,419
minister material function in

550
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:28,409
collaboration with the army the Navy and

551
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:31,049
the Air Force as opposed to a SIF not

552
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:34,229
function now the interesting thing is is

553
00:23:34,229 --> 00:23:35,879
that DCO operations

554
00:23:35,879 --> 00:23:38,609
sorry that's redundant DCO is kind of

555
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:40,830
support of this once the MA has been

556
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,979
done and the system is deployed or the

557
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:46,379
platform you still need to protect it as

558
00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:48,719
it's part of a bigger Network it's part

559
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,759
of a bigger operation so you still have

560
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:52,379
to help make sure that the things that

561
00:23:52,379 --> 00:23:54,989
that residual risk is is managed but

562
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:57,119
we're not there at the beginning to make

563
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:58,799
sure it's done that's not that's not SIF

564
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,919
Knox role that's not a DCO function

565
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:06,929
hopefully that clarifies so now I'm

566
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:09,289
gonna I'm gonna move off and kind of

567
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:11,399
talk a little bit more about evolution

568
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:13,259
in the the big hand small map sense

569
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:16,139
because strongest secure engaged laid

570
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:18,719
out seven initiatives last year when it

571
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:20,429
was released in June and I briefed them

572
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:24,299
all on what the implications were for

573
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,159
the department or for the key Arab

574
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,220
forces from a cyber perspective

575
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,260
today I'm going to talk about four of

576
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,880
them because we've made quite a bit of

577
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,740
progress on two and there's two that

578
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,350
we're still working on and before

579
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,060
anybody goes I don't know what these

580
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,470
initiative numbers are don't worry I've

581
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:44,430
got a slide so the whole point of all

582
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,770
this is is as we evolve we're not going

583
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,960
to be duplicating the centre's functions

584
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,850
the center will be responsible for the

585
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,460
enterprise wide IT security and while we

586
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,740
will use similar techniques and similar

587
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,230
technologies when we do DCO it's and

588
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,900
deliberate support of an operation yes

589
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,990
I'm a broken record I know but it is a

590
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,320
different thing right it's just like a

591
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,550
particular line of business might have

592
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,470
special needs in terms of their IT

593
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,060
security program and making sure that

594
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,970
you know the web's the web servers and

595
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,530
their security might be a very different

596
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,990
focus and effort than the email

597
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,810
infrastructure for example um think of

598
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,810
it in that sense but at this point and

599
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,810
again I'm gonna flash them up initiative

600
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,810
65 and 89 are being met now 89 that's

601
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:31,860
the one that's near and dear to my heart

602
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,660
because that's the one that established

603
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,220
the occupation I am now the senior

604
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,170
member of so it's kind of kind of cool

605
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:40,620
that we're making some progress and 75

606
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,050
and 80 continue to be worked on so just

607
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,700
as a reminder and sorry if it's a bit of

608
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,330
an eye chart 65 was talking about

609
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,190
cryptographic capabilities information

610
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,230
operations capabilities cyber

611
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:56,700
capabilities including offensive 75 was

612
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,440
talking about the reserve force and last

613
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,480
year when I briefed a lot of the

614
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,220
questions I got at the end of my my

615
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,560
briefing we're related to okay I'm an IT

616
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,120
security professional working here in

617
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,680
Ottawa and I'd really like to contribute

618
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,140
how do I join the reserves I'd love to

619
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,400
tell you I'm gonna be able to stand here

620
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,630
today and give you the answer that

621
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,220
question because I couldn't last year

622
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,780
and while I can provide an update

623
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,430
there's still really no answer yet and

624
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,710
I'll get into that if time permits I

625
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,100
eighty eight is the cyber capabilities

626
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,650
that that offensive piece and 89 of

627
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,180
course is the cyber force growing the

628
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,860
cyber force including including the

629
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,980
cyber operator occupation so we've made

630
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,750
some progress I've already talked about

631
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,090
why the offensive piece hasn't gotten

632
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,890
very far yet it's it's a legislative

633
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,470
problem it's a legal issue it's

634
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,149
the answer to the question so what

635
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:48,970
constitutes an act of war in cyber is

636
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,609
still being worked on just to to nip any

637
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,009
questions in that area in the bud right

638
00:26:54,009 --> 00:26:56,470
off the bat and of course the reserved

639
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,989
piece is still being worked on because

640
00:26:57,989 --> 00:27:02,190
it ends up employing reservists is hurt

641
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:05,320
we don't have one reserved employment

642
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,629
structure we actually have three because

643
00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:09,340
the Air Force the Navy and the army all

644
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,200
employ their reservists differently but

645
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,559
cyber is a a what we call a purple

646
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,019
problem or it touches all of them and we

647
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:19,509
don't have an employment structure that

648
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:21,279
that lets us employ people across all

649
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,019
three environments so it's part of the

650
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:25,110
HR challenge we're dealing with

651
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,920
[Applause]
