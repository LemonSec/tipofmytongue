2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,769
how many of you if you're trying to

3
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:16,980
decide which cybersecurity solution you

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,199
want to implement you're thinking you're

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,850
deciding should be Cisco should be

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,160
checkpoint how many of you would go into

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,010
Google look at the local psychic and

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,810
consult with her anybody yes okay no

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,690
there are some 1% of you okay now what

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,000
if I told you my friend Dan

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,790
he knows this incredible psychic the

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,700
amazing Zelda and he called her and she

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,789
told him go with the checkpoint solution

14
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,100
with firewall that was in September four

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,730
weeks later he still hasn't had a breach

16
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,390
she's amazing

17
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,640
so if you know that I say should use her

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,539
she's got a track record then who would

19
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,370
feel confidence in doing that hey okay

20
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,280
so now this might sound like a silly

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,729
question but seriously this is my life

22
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,939
okay working in data science and when

23
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,950
people find out what we do we work in

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,830
predictive analytics etc I get oh so you

25
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,570
guys are like Cambridge analytic

26
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,799
right now we as a serious science

27
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,460
company I employ PhDs and physics

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,740
masters and machine learning no we're

29
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,930
not like the guy at Cambridge analytical

30
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,150
high school dropout the pink hair who

31
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,360
claims that he got Briggs it and he did

32
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,009
the Trump election and all of those

33
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:44,450
things no we are not like that and and

34
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,770
so I wanted to talk to you today Mike

35
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,229
asked me to to speak today

36
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,840
on the topic of Cambridge analytic abhi

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,700
cuz I know and he knows that a lot of

38
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,189
you in your jobs not not just as in

39
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,689
cybersecurity but as chief information

40
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,680
officers etc are asked to look at

41
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,710
solutions and things that might violate

42
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,659
privacy your privacy protocols the laws

43
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,690
of the country and and so I wanted to

44
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,670
talk to you a bit today not just about

45
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,590
privacy but about

46
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,170
junk science if you will because I think

47
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,750
a lot of the time when we look at the

48
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,840
the stories and the coverage of

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,940
Cambridge analytic it was all about

50
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,040
whether or not they had violated privacy

51
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,560
and hardly anything on whether or not

52
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,959
they were actually responsible for the

53
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,010
things that they claimed to be

54
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,349
responsible for and if you look at the

55
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:36,000
science and you look at how they work

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,060
you will see that nothing that they did

57
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,489
no methodology that they followed could

58
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:43,170
have possibly been responsible for the

59
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,880
things they claim to be they are

60
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,910
essentially charlatans and I think it's

61
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,709
important to point that out because if

62
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:52,650
we believe that we have to violate our

63
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,709
clients privacy in order to get results

64
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,080
for the marketing team then you're much

65
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,080
more likely to to breach privacy and to

66
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,480
break the law but if you know that it's

67
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,580
not going to work anyway and that you

68
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,709
can get the marketing team the results

69
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:10,440
that they want be accurate and you don't

70
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,540
have to violate in any privacy in fact

71
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,400
you'll do better if you don't then

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,459
you're not tempted to do those things so

73
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,859
I want it to look a little bit at the

74
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:23,549
science what we know and to work and not

75
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:25,829
work in data science and talk a little

76
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,019
bit about privacy laws and how they're

77
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,880
likely to evolve in this space in Canada

78
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,190
and just so you know noting that

79
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,709
Cambridge analytic Adid was illegal in

80
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:38,040
Canada in fact I rap funded their their

81
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,000
company out in Vancouver they they did

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,569
not violate any Canadian privacy laws

83
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:47,579
they did violate European privacy laws

84
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,230
but they weren't operating in Europe so

85
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,150
none of what they did actually violates

86
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,180
Canadian privacy law yet but I wouldn't

87
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,340
go out and buy systems like that or buy

88
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,620
similar companies because probably those

89
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,600
laws are going to change in the wake of

90
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,690
that in public outcry and so it's not

91
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,829
something you want to invest in

92
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:07,650
necessarily but how do we know that it

93
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,870
that it didn't work and Cambridge

94
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,269
analytic a what they did was they sent

95
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:15,060
out surveys to people and based on those

96
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,728
surveys they created profiles of what

97
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:20,339
people were like and they had one of

98
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,970
five categories it's the ocean the ocean

99
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,830
psychographic profiles right open

100
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,159
chinches agreeable neurotic now this is

101
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:31,259
not new they claim that this is

102
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:32,759
something they invented they didn't I

103
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,830
remember seeing the ocean psychographics

104
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,379
when I worked in advertising 10 years

105
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:39,449
ago up on the wall in the boardroom it's

106
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:42,240
not you and you cannot use it to predict

107
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,889
how somebody is going to vote why not

108
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:49,080
well I'm feeling neurotic right now

109
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,509
right because I'm standing up in a

110
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:54,240
podium and I'm speaking but I'm not

111
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,250
neurotic all the time okay at least I

112
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,650
don't think so maybe my my co-workers

113
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,300
think so but I'm not neurotic all the

114
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,969
time I'm just neurotic now if you ask me

115
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,490
who I'm going to vote for now I might

116
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,159
say Donald Trump because frankly when

117
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:09,750
I'm up and I'm speaking he makes me feel

118
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,650
good about myself right but after a nice

119
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,539
glass of scotch tonight and I'm relaxing

120
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:17,099
I'm gonna feel more open and more

121
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:19,639
agreeable I'm going to change my opinion

122
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,340
the lesson is you cannot first of all

123
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,219
people's personalities change throughout

124
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:27,930
the day they changed the context that

125
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,430
they're in that's why I was there's

126
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,960
there's all sorts of you know I get

127
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,699
asked all sorts of questions or there's

128
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,860
this technology where you strap this

129
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,509
thing on to your brain and measure your

130
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:38,129
measures your brainwaves while you're

131
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,750
shopping for shoes and it says okay

132
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,150
you're this type of shopper well that's

133
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,919
if I'm shopping with for shoes of my own

134
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,110
if I'm shopping for shoes with a toddler

135
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,330
I have a totally different personality

136
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,219
right so are you gonna be measuring me

137
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:52,050
all the time it cost fifty thousand

138
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,339
dollars to wear one of these things it's

139
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:55,650
silly people's personalities change

140
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,669
throughout the day they change

141
00:05:56,669 --> 00:05:59,699
throughout time and even if somebody

142
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,860
stayed the same way all the time they

143
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,930
were always agreeable or they were

144
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,839
always neurotic you still can't use that

145
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,909
label to say how somebody is going to

146
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:12,599
vote you also can't change somebody's

147
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:15,419
vote now think think about you can't get

148
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,490
people to do things that they don't

149
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,930
believe in so for example look at the

150
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,210
the the campaign to stop people from

151
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,400
drinking and driving how long did it

152
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,889
take the government with those ads

153
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,050
before we actually started to see a

154
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,870
reduction in drinking and driving it

155
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,209
actual fact on the streets anybody want

156
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:38,599
to hazard a guess

157
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:41,999
yeah took 20 years it took an entire

158
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:45,360
generation of advertising to do

159
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,210
something that makes logical sense it

160
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,430
was similar to quitting smoking it took

161
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,249
an entire generation it took kids seeing

162
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:55,139
their parents and grandparents dying

163
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,599
from the effects of lung cancer it took

164
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,419
a lot a lot a lot of PR work so to say

165
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,039
that you're gonna change somebody's vote

166
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:05,099
in a 30-day campaign is pretty crazy and

167
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:07,379
frankly I actually think people are just

168
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:08,729
using quebra gentle that it gives an

169
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,110
excuse because Americans don't want to

170
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,490
admit that they voted for Donald Trump

171
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,919
and they did he won fair and square it's

172
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,930
not because of ads that people saw from

173
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:22,469
Cambridge analytical so what Cambridge

174
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:24,960
analytic did with the business they were

175
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,649
in was micro targeting and as a CIO or

176
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,659
somebody works in information technology

177
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:34,259
you will often be asked from people in

178
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,520
the marketing group or people in your

179
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,259
business team we've got this new

180
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,389
fandangled solution it does micro

181
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:41,219
targeting it's an app it's gonna follow

182
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:43,319
Mike everywhere he goes it's gonna

183
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,330
record everybody he dates what he eats

184
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,069
for supper what he has for lunch what

185
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:48,719
he's doing and based on that we can

186
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,789
figure out that he's going to buy grapes

187
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:52,770
at 2:00 o'clock on Tuesday at the Metro

188
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,069
okay you know right away that this is

189
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:00,479
this is not it's not possible to track

190
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,789
what an individual is going to do even

191
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:04,589
if you have reams and reams and reams of

192
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:06,899
information on that person think about

193
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:10,649
your own life how many times this week

194
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:13,559
did your plans whatever they were get

195
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,629
derailed right you might have had plans

196
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:19,169
to do something the kid is sick your

197
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:22,439
wife falls down the stairs you're going

198
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,300
to meet with a co-worker he or she

199
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,999
cancels your plans are derailed so even

200
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:29,370
you can't figure out what you are going

201
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,068
to do tomorrow or this weekend you might

202
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:35,729
have plans but those plans will change

203
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:37,708
so for me to try and figure out because

204
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,389
I work in data science and I have lots

205
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:41,429
of data on you what you're going to do

206
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,860
this weekend I'm going to have a very

207
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,510
very high margin of error and I might be

208
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,430
right about one or two of you but if I

209
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,470
said everybody in this room I've got

210
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,819
enough date I'm gonna figure out what

211
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:52,170
all of you are doing two o'clock on

212
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:52,590
Saturday

213
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,690
day you should know right then and there

214
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,730
that's a snake oil salesman because

215
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,670
nobody can do that what we can do is

216
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,470
what actuaries have been doing for

217
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,710
decades in fact is do population trend

218
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,480
research so while the fortune-teller

219
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,950
probably only gets it right 1 or 2

220
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,540
percent of the time and that's why she's

221
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,820
living in a tent and you know scraping

222
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,840
by your insurance brokers are also in

223
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,040
the prediction business

224
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,100
they're called actuaries and they're not

225
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,020
living in a tent ok they're living very

226
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,490
well and they're making billions of

227
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,700
dollars in profits why because they

228
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,620
might look at you and say Ted

229
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,840
you look fantastic your parents live to

230
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,250
a hundred you don't smoke you don't

231
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,490
drink you're not neurotic I'm gonna give

232
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,390
you a million dollar life insurance

233
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,640
policy and then you walk out of the

234
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,900
office you get hit by a car

235
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,720
he's just lost a million dollars but

236
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,060
that's ok because he's got a hundred

237
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,980
thousand more people like you so he'll

238
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,590
be wrong 5 percent of the time but he'll

239
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,620
be right 95 percent of the time and that

240
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,770
kind of research works and we know that

241
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,920
so if you're going to be doing market

242
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,080
research or trend analysis you've got to

243
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,910
do it the way stat scan does it the way

244
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,910
Health Canada does it the way anybody

245
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,130
who has ever had success in research

246
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,380
does it you're looking at the aggregate

247
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,760
you're looking at population level

248
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,500
trends now that doesn't mean you can't

249
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,170
see trends and demographics that you

250
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,270
can't see trends in psychographics

251
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,030
absolutely you can but the longer out

252
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,670
you try to predict the less accurate it

253
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,350
will be it's just like the weather I can

254
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,290
tell you later today it's probably going

255
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:38,850
to be gray and damp if I try to tell you

256
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,350
what the weather's going to be like in

257
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,100
January

258
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,640
aside from cold I'm less likely to be

259
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,060
accurate ok so and that's because people

260
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,580
change etc etc of what I'm gonna buy

261
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,190
depends on somebody's birthday it is or

262
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,790
what-have-you things just change so

263
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,860
number one population level statistics

264
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,440
very accurate micro-targeting very

265
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,390
inaccurate what does that mean for

266
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,240
privacy is there any value

267
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,189
having reams and reams and reams of data

268
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:11,160
about Mike Zeus or am I better off

269
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,499
having reams of data about a hundred

270
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:15,779
thousand people like Mike and trying to

271
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,720
see trends avocados trending the keto

272
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,850
diet is trending or it's not trending I

273
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,369
think you know as people who have a

274
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:25,499
science-based background the population

275
00:11:25,499 --> 00:11:26,910
level research is gonna be a lot more

276
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,569
accurate we've been doing micro

277
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:32,550
targeting for a while loyalty programs

278
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,619
what are what are companies doing now

279
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:35,790
they're getting out of the loyalty

280
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,610
programs why because they're very

281
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,589
expensive to run they're 2 to 3% of

282
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:43,920
revenue top-line revenue and they're not

283
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,379
giving you they're not improving their

284
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:47,730
improving sales in the sense that people

285
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,439
come back to you which is cool but you

286
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:51,480
can do that with better marketing better

287
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,189
pricing being more competitive having a

288
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:54,600
better product which is the better way

289
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,699
to compete rather than bribing people to

290
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:58,709
buy your product from a data point of

291
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:01,019
view loyalty programs go out of date

292
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,999
very very quickly we get a lot of

293
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:04,170
customers to say can we give you our

294
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,899
loyalty program information we say well

295
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,179
is it more than six months old yeah then

296
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:10,139
no no thank you

297
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:12,209
anything more than six months old we

298
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:13,679
were the official pollster for the

299
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,189
Ontario election 124 ridings we got a

300
00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:19,709
hundred and eighteen bang on of the ones

301
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:22,499
we didn't get right five of them were

302
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:25,499
within a thousand votes so there were

303
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:27,420
only two that we really didn't get bang

304
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,399
on so we're able to do that with

305
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,350
population level research we now have

306
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,269
people coming up to us saying can I use

307
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:35,279
that AI that you used for the Ontario

308
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,269
election it's out of date so we have to

309
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:41,069
start it all over again and the Ontario

310
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:44,759
election was in June okay so data like I

311
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:46,679
said if you're trying to forecast too

312
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,259
far out you will be inaccurate if you've

313
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:51,839
got data in your system that is a year

314
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,089
old that is six months old forget it we

315
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:55,889
can get much much more accurate data

316
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:57,929
just going online and doing proper

317
00:12:57,929 --> 00:13:00,569
sampling of the population mmm

318
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:04,079
what about apps that that that do

319
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,329
loyalty and track you obsessively and

320
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:09,600
all that again very expensive let's say

321
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,009
you're working for the LCBO and you've

322
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:12,899
got an app and you know that Mike likes

323
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,699
to drink Malbec and every time he drives

324
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:16,319
by sorry I'm picking on you the only

325
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:19,079
person whose name I know every time he

326
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:20,040
drives by the

327
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,170
see Bo he gets a pop-up thing for a

328
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,630
Malbec but now Mike's dating somebody

329
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,790
who doesn't drink he's moved off from

330
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,980
the Malbec or maybe he's moved away from

331
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,959
here altogether so he's now living in

332
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,759
Kapuskasing and you don't know what he's

333
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:35,810
drinking over there you get the picture

334
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,459
people change not only that but mike is

335
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,250
going to get sick of the pop-ups we know

336
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,410
this to apps that do these types of

337
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,300
things lasts on average 30 days before

338
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,949
people take them off their phone

339
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:48,180
take them off their system they get

340
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,920
tired of it they get tired of being

341
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,529
messaged to so we do know science does

342
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:54,600
show us that micro targeting works in

343
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,209
the short-term you will see short term

344
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:57,839
results

345
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,519
that's what hooks you in it's kind of

346
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,110
like when you go gambling you go to the

347
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,639
casino lochley me and you win a few

348
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,930
times and then now you're there all

349
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,250
night because you got it literally got

350
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,259
hooked micro-targeting will hook you

351
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:09,149
that way but it doesn't work in the long

352
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:13,529
term and it's not good science so what

353
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:16,220
does that mean from a policy perspective

354
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,259
we've been lobbying really hard and we

355
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:22,319
are you know an AI company that works in

356
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,690
human behavior research we have had the

357
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,670
tires kicked on us thankfully at

358
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,110
Parliament Hill by the Privacy

359
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,699
Commissioner we do work with Health

360
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:31,260
Canada we do a lot of work so there is

361
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,860
no privacy violation and yet it is

362
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,940
extremely accurate

363
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,050
like I said Ontario election 118 at 124

364
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,329
ridings no political pundit got that

365
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:44,819
close and that was with no human

366
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:46,800
intervention just the AI predict the

367
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,500
election how does she do it getting

368
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,180
representative samples of people on

369
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,250
social media they get all sorts of

370
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,899
questions about that isn't social media

371
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,670
bias that's why you get representative

372
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,829
samples with population level research

373
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:00,600
where we're not capturing names we're

374
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,760
not capturing any personal personally

375
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,860
identifiable information we can still

376
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,740
get extremely extremely accurate

377
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,920
information from a firmer for our

378
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,870
customers and from a policy perspective

379
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:17,339
so we are big fans not wholesale of the

380
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,490
GDP our implementation in Europe there

381
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,990
are some issues with it and we're

382
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,639
working with government here to make

383
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,170
sure we don't make the same mistakes

384
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,269
that were made in that legislation but

385
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:31,439
definitely very big advocates for

386
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:33,750
protecting personal information

387
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,939
just because it's the right thing to do

388
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:38,610
from a policy perspective and from a

389
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,610
privacy perspective and for your brand

390
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,129
but because it's actually going to get

391
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:45,689
you better results from a business

392
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:51,209
perspective hmm we'll have a lot of

393
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:53,310
customers who say will you show us your

394
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,439
algorithm because other companies won't

395
00:15:55,439 --> 00:15:57,240
show us their algorithm that's probably

396
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,399
because they don't have one but

397
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,920
absolutely we do publish our algorithm

398
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,129
there is no black box we don't believe

399
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:06,899
in that we think that companies who are

400
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,089
working in this space should publish

401
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:10,829
their algorithms should make it clear

402
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:13,889
what they're doing to eliminate bias in

403
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,540
training because we get that a lot as

404
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,100
well how do I know that the results

405
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,930
aren't biased because we've all heard

406
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,230
about the recidivism AI that you know

407
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,000
was locking up visible minorities all

408
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,620
the time and things like that so yes we

409
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,839
have to be open about that about the

410
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,720
algorithms that we use there are no

411
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,209
black boxes and if you're ever working

412
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:35,100
with companies in this space it is

413
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,319
absolutely crucial that you get to look

414
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:39,089
under those covers because otherwise how

415
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:40,800
do you know a that this is real science

416
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,610
and and be that what they are giving you

417
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,930
is going to be unbiased and accurate mmm

418
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,230
most importantly and it's important to

419
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,910
be able to distinguish between a

420
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,269
methodology and a tool so we get all the

421
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:58,889
time oh we have social media listening

422
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:01,860
we're using radian6 we're using Sysomos

423
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,540
we're using all these things those are

424
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,179
tools and each time that you run them

425
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:08,010
you will get a different results why

426
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,020
because they're using reservoir sampling

427
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,929
so it takes in the first 50,000 posts

428
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:15,119
analyzes that but there are trillions of

429
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,039
posts on any given topic they're doing

430
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,720
keyword searches they're not doing it

431
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,520
they're not looking at representative

432
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,650
random samples of the population so of

433
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,000
course you know if you're doing a

434
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,010
keyword search you're getting a biased

435
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,270
result because you're only looking for

436
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,460
people speaking on that topic what you

437
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,200
want to be able to do is pull up you

438
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,510
want to do a people search not a keyword

439
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,340
search get a representative sample and

440
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,659
say how many people are talking about

441
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:38,190
this topic and what are they saying

442
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,200
you'll get radically different results

443
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,970
when you do the keyword it will be

444
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,919
different every time and that's why when

445
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,049
you when you see in the paper they'll

446
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:46,850
say this

447
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,010
survey is right within one point two

448
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,990
percentage points 19 times out of 20

449
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,360
what they mean is if you were to give

450
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,059
this methodology to 20 different

451
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:58,640
scientists and they were all to run it

452
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,950
they'd get the exact 19 of them would

453
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,049
get the exact same results that is

454
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,120
science based research when it's

455
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,190
repeatable if you were to do the same

456
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,850
thing with some of these tools night 20

457
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,130
people go out and do it 19 of them would

458
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,470
have radically different results that is

459
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,270
not a science-based research study so

460
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,950
these are the types of things that you

461
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,679
can that you can do to ensure that

462
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,320
you're getting real science in your data

463
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,169
research that you are not violating

464
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:30,020
privacy that you're not subject to to

465
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,100
bias and and that's about it I didn't

466
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,570
want to make it too long during lunch I

467
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,179
wanted to leave things open for for

468
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:40,940
questions yes we are doing the midterm

469
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,590
elections if anybody has questions about

470
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,830
that in the US but are there any

471
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,990
questions that people have because I

472
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,970
wanted to get into questions pretty

473
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,700
quickly so that we get engaged yep yes

474
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,309
so the so let me see if I got your

475
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:57,020
question right so trying to predict how

476
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,590
each person will vote is impossible but

477
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,750
could I if I figured out the

478
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,789
demographics and the personalities the

479
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:06,350
people in the room influenced them to

480
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,809
vote a different way if I had enough

481
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:11,450
time so now it's important to understand

482
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,770
what I would not be doing is selling

483
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,140
selling skis to people who live in the

484
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,650
desert okay so it's it's really almost

485
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,990
impossible to get people to do things

486
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,059
that they wouldn't otherwise do or that

487
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:28,250
they don't believe in it takes a long

488
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,970
time to change public opinion normally

489
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,860
but what we can do so in the work that

490
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,720
we've done we've seen that it's probably

491
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,659
about 1% of any kind of advertising or

492
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:40,220
work that you put out there will

493
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,440
actually move the needle we are able to

494
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,659
see what that 1% is and it doesn't have

495
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:47,120
to be digital we can look at speeches we

496
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,650
could look at television ads we can look

497
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,200
at bus ads and we can see what's working

498
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,150
and what isn't working so that we can

499
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,650
concentrate on those things that are

500
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,679
working now we did do some work for a

501
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,110
company in the United States last year

502
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,690
they had a chemical mostly used in farms

503
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,250
but the protest was coming from people

504
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,510
who were using it on their lawns and

505
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,760
there was concern that the that the

506
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,960
chemical could have adverse health

507
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,900
effects specifically on children and

508
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,290
pets now the research most of the

509
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,480
research showed that it didn't there was

510
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,370
one bit of research that showed that it

511
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,410
could so it was going up in front of the

512
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,820
EPA to be to be voted on two things that

513
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,679
were interesting number one when

514
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,210
something goes in front of the EPA in

515
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,850
the United States the cases that are

516
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,590
going up unlike an Environment Canada or

517
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,450
we have a hearing it's closed there

518
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,950
everything is open it's up on the

519
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,630
website we're going to be looking at

520
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,309
this chemical whatever and then all

521
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:42,559
these all the groups like Greenpeace and

522
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,059
the World Wildlife Fund or whatever can

523
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:45,950
then come and launch a campaign against

524
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,650
this this chemical so they hired us to

525
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,330
say how many protests are we going to

526
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,580
get when we go in front of the EPA we

527
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,260
told them and because we don't ask any

528
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,460
questions or anything right we're

529
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,280
gleaning all this information quietly we

530
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,799
told them you won't get any between zero

531
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,970
and two thousand because there's always

532
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,559
an interval and the the person who had

533
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,640
hired us said well that's just

534
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,740
ridiculous like you said I I was into

535
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,410
this AI thing but now I totally don't

536
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,679
believe in it because you know he said

537
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,900
you have to realize here in the US there

538
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,640
are people who their full-time job is to

539
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,380
protest so they're definitely going to

540
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,360
be protesting with the lowest number of

541
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,280
calls we've ever had when we've gone in

542
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,900
front the EPA is three hundred and fifty

543
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,840
thousand so we had our tail between our

544
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,390
legs we walked out very embarrassed to

545
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,980
this day that was last year they haven't

546
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,350
had a single call okay so the AI was

547
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,590
bang on so they hired us back now there

548
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,020
was legislation to ban the chemical and

549
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,090
they wanted to know and at the time that

550
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,770
this legislation was coming through

551
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,780
fifty six percent of the population was

552
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,059
against the chemical so they were going

553
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,120
to lose in public opinion they hired us

554
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,549
and we did what's called message testing

555
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:57,410
to figure out now this is not

556
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,299
brainwashing people it's important to

557
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:01,179
understand the distinction it's not

558
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:03,260
convinced you know lying to people or

559
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,640
convincing them of things that aren't

560
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,610
true it's saying here are we've only got

561
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,650
one kick at the can here there's lots we

562
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,929
could say we could say oh look there

563
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:13,770
have been 1,200 studies

564
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,539
you know only one of them said it was

565
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:18,419
bad there could be messaging that says

566
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:19,890
look if we get rid of this chemical

567
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,140
farmers aren't going to be able to make

568
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,909
food in the price of food I mean they

569
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,200
will be able make food but the price of

570
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,580
food is gonna skyrocket it's gonna

571
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,049
affect your pocketbook so there are all

572
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:29,309
sorts of different messages they like

573
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:31,799
the farmer one we said no go with the

574
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,029
studies there have been lots of studies

575
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:35,580
and they show this they went and we

576
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,140
showed we were able to show them if you

577
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,870
did the farmer message it won't change

578
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,480
public opinion at all but if you do this

579
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,130
other one it will and they did the other

580
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,690
one it changed public opinion and the

581
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:48,029
legislation didn't pass so it's a long

582
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:49,320
way of answering your question because

583
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,330
these things are complicated but I want

584
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,120
to make it clear that we're not we're

585
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,919
not trying to convince people to do

586
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,510
things they don't believe in we're

587
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,190
making sure that people get the

588
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,870
information that is relevant to them

589
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,029
they want to know how many studies have

590
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:05,820
been done and what is what has been the

591
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,890
research on it when they're worried

592
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,480
about your health you're less concerned

593
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,909
about the price of corn okay once you've

594
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:14,340
got your health squared away then then

595
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,539
you have time to worry about the price

596
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:18,750
of corn so so that's what the research

597
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,309
showed and it worked very effectively so

598
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:22,590
all that to say you can use this that's

599
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,750
a branch of science called prescriptive

600
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,659
analytics it's where you're changing

601
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:28,919
behavior you're changing people's minds

602
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:31,590
it's very difficult to do it's a nascent

603
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,610
science prediction is much easier

604
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,470
prescriptive is much harder and it

605
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,020
typically takes quite a bit of time like

606
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,230
a year in a 30 day election campaign

607
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,820
when things are happening all the time

608
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,890
there's scandals resistors that one

609
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,350
thing we did find very clearly in the

610
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,179
Ontario election and other elections

611
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,440
we've had we're by the way the only

612
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,640
company in this country that got Bragg's

613
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,010
it right at 52% plus or minus one point

614
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,840
to one of only 16 companies in the world

615
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,549
to get that right so prediction is still

616
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:05,549
hard one things we notice is that

617
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:08,159
scandals don't affect public opinion the

618
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,710
way politicians think they do so we were

619
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,529
looking at it for the the Ontario

620
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:15,480
election that just passed and I was on

621
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,520
TV Oakes was giving regular commentary

622
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,919
and then they had the political pundits

623
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,750
who told who were telling us that these

624
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,159
scandals are really having a big effect

625
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:26,130
and I was the lone wolf saying no no

626
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,360
we've we're looking

627
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,850
we're looking at the stuffing the ballot

628
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,520
boxes and you know this set no thing and

629
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,090
Rob Doug Ford's widow and and it wasn't

630
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,800
moving a needle and one of the pundits

631
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,060
said you know I think Aaron's just

632
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,800
hearing all the Liberals who are posting

633
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,360
because they liberals have got a lot of

634
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,280
people posting and I said glad you

635
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,930
brought that up that's why we do

636
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,910
representative sampling we're able to

637
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,890
tell the difference those people aren't

638
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,430
in our sample but all that to say the

639
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,010
the scandals were not affecting how

640
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,330
people are going to vote what was

641
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,340
affecting except for one scandal which

642
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,070
was the NDP I thought it would be when

643
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,870
the NDP got the budget off by billion

644
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,250
dollars I thought that would hurt them

645
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,960
because you know that kind of hurts the

646
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,030
NDP where they're naturally hurting but

647
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,100
it didn't when she apologized everybody

648
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,320
forgave Andrew Horvath for that but the

649
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,630
Poppy's you know when they said poppies

650
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,160
were filling landfills or whatever it

651
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,110
was a slag veterans that did affect

652
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,210
their vote and the Hitler comment did

653
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,070
affect their vote but no other scandal

654
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,930
in the election was effective what was

655
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,170
effective was the tariffs Donald Trump

656
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,970
that really heard Andrea Horvath because

657
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,550
people thought okay well Andrew Horvath

658
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,100
space she came from Hamilton right so

659
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,680
steel town and and also sue st. Marie

660
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,140
where Algoma was headquartered they just

661
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,570
didn't see the NDP going up against

662
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:45,840
Donald Trump so that that affected their

663
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,420
popularity so we are able to see in a

664
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,570
very granular way what changes opinion

665
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,580
and if and we don't work for political

666
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,380
parties but if we did we would have said

667
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,680
talk about those those steel tariffs

668
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,710
don't bother with the sex scandals and

669
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,170
all of that because it really doesn't

670
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,520
change people's opinion at the end of

671
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,970
the day yep they can do that right now

672
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,530
so we're working with the number of

673
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,680
Elections bodies in other countries for

674
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,360
that so it is interesting I gave a talk

675
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,930
on this not too long ago on the whole

676
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:22,230
fake news thing and it was funny because

677
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,030
it was the government of Canada and they

678
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,380
were asking for people to come up with

679
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,030
you know what are your solutions for how

680
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,340
how we deal with fake news which we call

681
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,870
manufactured news just because we don't

682
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,720
want to use the same terminology as you

683
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,110
know the propaganda and so manufactured

684
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:40,260
news and how do you how do you detect it

685
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,250
now the others all came out

686
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,690
with okay well we're gonna look at the

687
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,000
news we're gonna have text analytics and

688
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,070
we're gonna say if they talk about hate

689
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,780
and all that kind of stuff and I got up

690
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,310
and I said okay the last okay that makes

691
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,890
us China right I think if we start going

692
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,020
through the content of what people are

693
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,370
putting out there and say no that

694
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,140
content I don't like that content take

695
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,180
that off that's hateful and you're

696
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,440
getting yourself into a really

697
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,320
precarious situation so what we said is

698
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,620
fake I'm saying you know manufactured

699
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,320
news or any kind of content that's put

700
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,690
out by it whether it's a state actor or

701
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,640
any other kind of actor moves through

702
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,970
the network differently from credible

703
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,730
news okay so if you come up with

704
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,500
something says okay Justin Justin

705
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,580
Trudeau's a pedophile

706
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:28,140
okay reasonable people are probably not

707
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,460
going to be circulating that to their

708
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,730
friends and family right and we get that

709
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,780
all the time where you get things that

710
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,100
you know we're obviously fake you don't

711
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,570
you don't spread it around because you

712
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,570
don't want to look like that person so

713
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,040
but there are certain pockets of the

714
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,200
population that will circulate it and

715
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,840
bots will circulate it so what we do is

716
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,180
we take a representative sample of the

717
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:52,200
population say 300,000 Canadians who we

718
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,400
know are representative of the

719
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,170
population and there's all sorts of ways

720
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,580
that we know that they're representative

721
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,850
but they are randomly chosen and they

722
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,880
they have the whole we can we can figure

723
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,520
out a lot about the population by you

724
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,770
know using text analytics and then we

725
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,530
just take the firehose from Twitter or

726
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,330
from Facebook or we have you just take

727
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,370
that firehose which is everything that

728
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,730
goes through or we do a reservoir sample

729
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,340
news that is manufactured we'll go

730
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,000
through quickly through the bots and

731
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,100
through certain populations may be alt

732
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,750
dot right or whatever we can create a

733
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,970
sample of alt out right and it'll move

734
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,700
quickly through those populations but in

735
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,430
the quote-unquote average population

736
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,530
that story will not circulate at the

737
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,660
same rate and that's what we do we say

738
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,140
this story is circulating in a

739
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,080
manufactured way put it aside and let a

740
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,180
human being look at it and make that

741
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,730
judgment and we feel that's a much

742
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,980
better way of handling that situation

743
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,630
than trying

744
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:58,250
to be the the the police who decide

745
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,450
whether or not something is worthy of

746
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,090
being circulated and we and we do that

747
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,429
also for things where somebody's saying

748
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:06,230
the polling station has changed things

749
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,450
like that we can we can detect those

750
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,740
things when the shooting happened in

751
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,900
Parliament Hill here in Ottawa we were

752
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,020
we were getting accurate reports of what

753
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,789
was happening before the police tweeted

754
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:19,760
them out we knew that Stephen Harper was

755
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,049
headed to Meech Lake because we were

756
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:22,429
seeing the tweets people saw him going

757
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:24,919
by in the car so all of those things so

758
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:27,200
from a security perspective from a fraud

759
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,440
perspective is definitely things that we

760
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,210
can do right now we could also prove

761
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,620
whether or not by the way Cambridge

762
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,150
analytic a really was effective in

763
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,070
moving the needle if they give the ads

764
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,630
that they put out there because

765
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,549
everything on social media is still

766
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:42,470
there we can go back to 2012 get a

767
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,720
representative sample we can go back to

768
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,150
the election to brexit to Trump and we

769
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,220
can and we can prove once and for all

770
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,450
but of course they're not they're not

771
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,929
giving that content up but we have put

772
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:57,520
that challenge out to them yes

773
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,440
24% of people will still vote for him

774
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,130
yes it's really interesting there

775
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,980
there's so the question was Trump says

776
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,299
he could shoot somebody in the middle of

777
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:10,580
Times Square and people will still vote

778
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,860
for him and yes that is true we there

779
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,510
are people who would still vote for him

780
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,450
he's got a good 24 percent of the base

781
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,690
in the United States that that will vote

782
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,400
for him I don't know if he's maybe if he

783
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,570
shot somebody in Times Square and and

784
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,710
you're not going to move that needle and

785
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,850
that's why we say to a lot of our

786
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,260
customers see these people over here

787
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,720
you're not changing that it's the people

788
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,070
in the middle or the people who are

789
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,830
unsure that's that sure that's your

790
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,390
target market and that's why when we're

791
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,669
when we say yes we can do prescriptive

792
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:42,980
analytics we can we can definitely use

793
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,200
marketing to to change minds and stuff

794
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,880
like that there's some people whose

795
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,409
minds you're never going to change and

796
00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:51,020
interestingly because of the way the

797
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,539
boundaries are drawn in the United

798
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:56,659
States right now you know the Democrats

799
00:30:56,659 --> 00:30:58,309
we're looking at getting about a 24 seat

800
00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:01,370
majority in the midterms because the

801
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,530
Democrats are going to come out in high

802
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:06,110
numbers and the Trump supporters not but

803
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,440
if all the Trump supporters came

804
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,330
and all the Democrats came out or a

805
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,130
voter turnout were what it normally is

806
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,270
that's why you see everybody in the

807
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,250
states with the vote vote if voter

808
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,840
turnout were to say what it normally is

809
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,520
because Republicans are more likely to

810
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,560
vote than Democrats there would only be

811
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,960
a bit 11 seat difference which is kind

812
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,430
of astounding when you think of you know

813
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:26,130
what's going on there and that's that's

814
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,400
so with 24% of the vote and there's you

815
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,020
know over 400 districts in the United

816
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,450
States with just 24 percent support he

817
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,390
could almost you know come through and

818
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,310
win a majority but even even with with

819
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,080
that the the Democrats are gonna win

820
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,500
majority this time so what we're seeing

821
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,220
question I know there was another

822
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:52,770
question yep you oh yes the midterm yeah

823
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,020
so we are seeing a Democrat majority

824
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,540
like I said about by the 24 C's there

825
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,700
are still 80 districts that are very

826
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,010
much in contention so it could go either

827
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,320
way

828
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,220
but it looks like a Democrat majority

829
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:15,990
yes it's something about him we don't we

830
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,210
don't normally actually a sitting

831
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,740
president would have higher than 24%

832
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,620
actually like 24 percents really low for

833
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,100
somebody who's two years into his term

834
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,770
we we find it it differs from leader to

835
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:34,470
leader you know it's it's it's

836
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,270
interesting when we look at all of the

837
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,940
issues in the United States

838
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,620
Kojo G would have you all the issues

839
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,880
that are going on the only one that's

840
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,380
really moving the needle is the Brett

841
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,150
Kavanaugh issue

842
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,810
it's mobilizing women in ways that are

843
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,880
you know that it's actually mobilized

844
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,860
people that particular issue but nothing

845
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,500
else has NAFTA hasn't it's interesting

846
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,600
to that the jobs even though

847
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,790
unemployment's at 3.5%

848
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,390
one of the main things that's driving

849
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,670
youth to the polls in the midterms

850
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,230
because they almost never vote in

851
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,720
midterm elections is jobs because a lot

852
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,320
of educated Americans feel like young

853
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,390
graduates feel that these jobs are not

854
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:17,130
the kind of jobs they want you know

855
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,240
they're they don't want to work in the

856
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,270
coal mine they don't want to work in the

857
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,010
sector if you're graduating with a

858
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,679
degree and machine learning is Trump

859
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:26,600
doing the right thing for you you know

860
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,929
they don't feel that he is they feel the

861
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:31,490
it's not just having a job it's having

862
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,980
the right job so there's definitely a

863
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,559
big feeling of that their skills are not

864
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,240
going to be used and that America is not

865
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,400
poised for the economy of the future

866
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,460
there's definitely a a big current of

867
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:47,360
Americans who feel that way which is

868
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,160
unusual and the unemployment rate is so

869
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,990
low usually people are just happy about

870
00:33:50,990 --> 00:34:00,110
that are there yep the biggest one we

871
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,110
see is sorry the question was what

872
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:06,410
mistakes do you see in the GDP are the

873
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,690
biggest one for us is explained ability

874
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:11,060
so from an AI perspective I'm speaking

875
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,010
here so explain ability is when you say

876
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:18,679
so for brexit for example we we saw it

877
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,270
was going to be a remain remain until

878
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,179
three days before the referendum and

879
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:25,250
then the AI toggled and said it's going

880
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,609
to be exit so I mean so we sent out a

881
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:31,100
press release the morning of before the

882
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,109
polls opened in England in Britain and

883
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:35,359
we said it's going to be an exit at 52%

884
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,940
plus or minus 1.2 like I said we were

885
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,310
the only company in this country that

886
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,510
said that so of course everybody who's

887
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,210
booking me for interviews right so I was

888
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,129
gonna be on CBC the next morning and

889
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:48,859
that night at 10 o'clock at night Nigel

890
00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:50,570
Farage who was one of the leaders of the

891
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:54,619
exit group held a press conference and

892
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:58,190
said everybody go home we have lost even

893
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,720
though the results weren't in yet he

894
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,640
said my friends in the financial sector

895
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,220
hired the best pollsters in the world

896
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,020
and they all say it's going to be

897
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,420
remained and he was an exit guy so you

898
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,300
know so that producer at CBC texted me

899
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,010
10 o'clock at night and said you're

900
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,600
gonna be on first thing tomorrow morning

901
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,300
as the results are coming in right we

902
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,859
were just gonna be finding it at like

903
00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:21,170
7:00 in the morning and Nigel Farage has

904
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,600
just conceded defeat do you want to

905
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,820
change your prediction because he's

906
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,170
feeling really sorry for me at this

907
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,100
point ray because he said you're gonna

908
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,390
be in with two others who say it's gonna

909
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,910
be remain so I call our chief scientists

910
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,680
at home are you sure

911
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,059
because I'm the one who's gonna like

912
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:37,190
look like the idiot backpedaling for 15

913
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:40,790
minutes live on the air and he said he

914
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,079
ran it again he said don't know what to

915
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,440
tell you Aaron it says exit at 52% so I

916
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,010
texted the producer back his name is

917
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,930
Howard Goldenthal you can verify with

918
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,240
him and I said we stand by our forecasts

919
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,250
it's going to be an exit at 52% and I

920
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,490
didn't sleep all night now and it was an

921
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,859
exit when I came in the other two they

922
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,300
told him don't come in you didn't get it

923
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,800
right the other two pollsters so it was

924
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,480
just me in the studio for 15 minutes

925
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,940
needing to explain what happened in

926
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,970
Britain right and so I spent the whole

927
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,880
night trying to figure out why is the AI

928
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,740
saying that that's why I say explain

929
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,839
ability is hard we had to go through

930
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,780
every hour for the last 72 hours

931
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,720
leading up to the referendum to see at

932
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,349
what point this thing toggled so we can

933
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:29,980
do explained ability we said to the AI

934
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,480
all right you know this event that event

935
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,010
this event that event nothing's moving

936
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,500
the needle we can say to the AI we can

937
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,720
unlike a human you can't say to a human

938
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,890
will pretend this event never happened

939
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:42,500
now how do you feel a person is not able

940
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,569
unless they're sociopathic or something

941
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:48,500
to divorce themselves from from that but

942
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,440
in AI can so you can say to an AI

943
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,670
pretend this never happened

944
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,500
now what is the result and it can

945
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,750
calculate that so as we were going

946
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,280
through all the events of the 72 hours

947
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,630
leading up to brexit and this is how we

948
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,069
know by the another reason we know

949
00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:03,559
Cambridge analytic ydynt this unless

950
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:08,960
they shot Joe Cox is because we got up

951
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,500
to the assassination of Joe Cox and

952
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:16,520
before she died it was remain and then

953
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,410
we say Joe Cox is dead

954
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,530
exit okay now so then you think okay the

955
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,020
assassination of Joe Cox but it wasn't

956
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,910
the and by the way it wasn't like the

957
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,619
minute she died it was okay she died the

958
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:29,420
next day it still remain okay so we're

959
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,250
not thinking it's her assassination per

960
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:36,010
se what happened after her assassination

961
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,119
David Cameron gave a speech to the

962
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:41,390
nation and while he was speaking so we

963
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:45,920
went through his speaking engagement his

964
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,269
press conference and we

965
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:48,979
went through every line dad thought that

966
00:37:48,979 --> 00:37:50,719
uh he gets to a point where he says

967
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:53,390
let's all observe silence in honor of

968
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:56,599
Joe Cox we're not gonna campaign we're

969
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:00,259
not going to go door to door you know we

970
00:38:00,259 --> 00:38:01,939
want you to just observe this moment of

971
00:38:01,939 --> 00:38:03,199
silence don't talk about it with your

972
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:05,419
friends and the a I said it was the

973
00:38:05,419 --> 00:38:09,169
silence that caused the exit so why did

974
00:38:09,169 --> 00:38:10,819
the silence cause the exit well okay

975
00:38:10,819 --> 00:38:12,199
this is where it gets into explain

976
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:15,109
ability but what the a I noticed was

977
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:17,479
that if people came on with their

978
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:19,279
friends and said I'm thinking of voting

979
00:38:19,279 --> 00:38:21,759
exit they would get pounced on your

980
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:24,559
xenophobe your anti-immigration your

981
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:29,269
this your that and so they would clam up

982
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:31,399
they'd go quiet and the AI noticed that

983
00:38:31,399 --> 00:38:33,559
when they came back they tended to be

984
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:36,140
reading the pro exit stuff they tended

985
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,029
to be leaning more exit so the AI

986
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:42,799
rightly derived that once people went

987
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:46,189
silent they tend to toggle over to exit

988
00:38:46,189 --> 00:38:48,799
they can't discuss their their their

989
00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:50,630
fears so they take it out of the polls

990
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,969
we were seeing that with Trump as well

991
00:38:52,969 --> 00:38:55,130
by the way silence is not good

992
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,779
keep keep people talking well unless you

993
00:38:56,779 --> 00:38:58,159
you know you want your candidate to win

994
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:00,289
and then silence is good but all that to

995
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:02,899
say that explain ability took us a very

996
00:39:02,899 --> 00:39:05,089
long time so your costs are gonna go

997
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:06,679
through the roof there are better ways

998
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:10,789
of making sure that your AI is not

999
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:12,649
biased or and the reason they want

1000
00:39:12,649 --> 00:39:14,329
explain ability is because of the whole

1001
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:16,279
you know when they tried to use an AI

1002
00:39:16,279 --> 00:39:18,679
for calculating recidivism rates and the

1003
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:20,329
AI was saying all black people are going

1004
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:23,239
to you know commit crimes again more

1005
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:23,929
than other people

1006
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:26,179
that's a bias and us that's been

1007
00:39:26,179 --> 00:39:27,979
reflected in the AI because of the way

1008
00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:29,569
it was trained it wasn't a properly

1009
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:32,749
trained AI so what you want to do is

1010
00:39:32,749 --> 00:39:34,729
make sure that your a is properly

1011
00:39:34,729 --> 00:39:36,529
trained so all those training materials

1012
00:39:36,529 --> 00:39:39,259
should be available because that will be

1013
00:39:39,259 --> 00:39:41,599
a lot more cost effective and lot more

1014
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,959
effective than than doing explained

1015
00:39:44,959 --> 00:39:46,369
ability you want to make sure that your

1016
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:49,099
algorithm is known and published I kind

1017
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:51,619
of use the Phoenix example you know if

1018
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:53,299
I'd given you all the code for Phoenix

1019
00:39:53,299 --> 00:39:54,469
ahead of time would you have known it

1020
00:39:54,469 --> 00:39:56,089
was going to screw up no you should have

1021
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:58,339
done pilots in case studies okay so

1022
00:39:58,339 --> 00:40:00,829
there are ways of training it with

1023
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:02,930
being overly burdensome and we think

1024
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,549
explain ability is the wrong way to go

1025
00:40:04,549 --> 00:40:06,289
because sometimes you just won't be able

1026
00:40:06,289 --> 00:40:07,999
to explain it but what you will be able

1027
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:11,900
to do is control the training and and

1028
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:17,859
look at the algorithm yes

1029
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,960
and what kind of controls do I have to

1030
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,109
what

1031
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,730
hold on I'm just gonna give you the

1032
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:48,450
microphone sorry sorry I was just having

1033
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:57,780
trouble hearing it turn it on maybe no

1034
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,330
okay good say since you seem to have a

1035
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:03,090
lot of influence and your data seems to

1036
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,970
be very good in some ways how do you

1037
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:08,100
deal with potential data and poisoning

1038
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,300
from the internal like what kind of

1039
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,390
controls you have to ensure that no

1040
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,220
although your data from the outside may

1041
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,000
be controlled

1042
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,590
how about internally how are you

1043
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,630
ensuring that it's not being yeah they

1044
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,690
used to use your influence like whether

1045
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,590
or not our staff are poisoning the data

1046
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:28,110
staff or somebody potentially breaching

1047
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,920
your systems to use that okay yes that's

1048
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,540
an excellent question because and that's

1049
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,060
so I'll answer the first one first with

1050
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:40,200
staff it is it is so an nai is an

1051
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,150
intelligence and like any intelligence

1052
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,220
you know it's not that people asked me a

1053
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,090
lot of time was the difference we in

1054
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:47,580
analytics and AI and AI learns it learns

1055
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,350
is we call it alien intelligence

1056
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,460
actually at the office instead of

1057
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,860
artificial because it is an intelligence

1058
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,140
and you can bias it so one of the things

1059
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,720
we don't allow right now our customers

1060
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,410
to train their own ai's because you

1061
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,730
really really need to know what you're

1062
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,350
doing even our own staff do make

1063
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:08,190
mistakes and we have ways of testing to

1064
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,440
see whether or not they've made they

1065
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,210
make mistakes because and we have found

1066
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:15,570
that they do you and and they're highly

1067
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,190
trained and they do this every day and

1068
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,690
they still make mistakes and the and the

1069
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:20,160
AI comes out bias I'll give you an

1070
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,690
example just a simple example

1071
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:23,460
statistical example because this is all

1072
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,830
statistics in countries like in our

1073
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:29,090
country in our judicial system we have a

1074
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:33,180
we have a policy of ul when you're up

1075
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,860
for trial that you are innocent until

1076
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,560
proven guilty there are other countries

1077
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,480
where you are guilty until proven

1078
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,570
innocent and in countries where the

1079
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,090
hypothesis is guilty until proven

1080
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:47,340
innocent the conviction rate is actually

1081
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,200
quite a bit higher statistically

1082
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,840
significant so whatever hypothesis you

1083
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,820
give the ai's

1084
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,440
we had an example where we were doing

1085
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,850
some work for a municipality and they

1086
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,410
wanted to know are people worried about

1087
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:02,780
crime the researcher mistakenly put in

1088
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,800
crime is a problem well that's not what

1089
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,450
you say to an AI because now the AI

1090
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,090
makes the assumption crime is a problem

1091
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:13,550
and needs to find evidence that it's not

1092
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,360
a problem

1093
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,300
so it's biased in favor of crime as the

1094
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,400
problem so we had to fix it and say just

1095
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,320
crime now it turned out to that they

1096
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,610
thought city council were the crime

1097
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:26,360
absolutely literally so we had to be

1098
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,980
more precise what do we mean by crime

1099
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,390
because obviously council didn't want

1100
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:33,650
that kind so so you know you have to be

1101
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:36,020
very precise and it's very hard to do so

1102
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,670
that's all we don't aletter allow our

1103
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:39,320
customers to do it now that's going to

1104
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,640
change because obviously that puts a

1105
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,830
human in the loop we are creating an AI

1106
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:46,430
that trains the AI again to keep it very

1107
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,560
very kind of professional and when that

1108
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,300
happens there will be a lot more

1109
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,170
precision in doing it and plus we'll be

1110
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,180
able to work much more quickly after

1111
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,610
that and the second question about

1112
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:02,630
breaches the the beauty of it is because

1113
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,340
facebook is paying for all the storage

1114
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,710
and Twitter and Instagram and all those

1115
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,170
guys we don't collect any data what we

1116
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:12,530
do is we collect results so we'll crawl

1117
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:15,410
through and people will say you know

1118
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:17,300
that you know what I say to people is

1119
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,010
weak we can't see anything that other

1120
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:20,660
people can't see we don't breach any

1121
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,190
privacy if you got your privacy turned

1122
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,530
on you'd be surprised how many people

1123
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,940
don't have the privacy turned on the way

1124
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:30,380
they do I think they do but anyway you

1125
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,490
know we're not we're not breaching any

1126
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:33,320
privacy and what we look at is we know

1127
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,120
what we're looking for and we just it's

1128
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,070
ticking boxes so if you were to break

1129
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,990
into our network there are no names

1130
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,880
we're not going to pay to store all

1131
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,190
these tweets and all these messages what

1132
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:45,740
we're looking for is voting this way or

1133
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,260
not voting this way or figuring out the

1134
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,700
information so that we come up with a

1135
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,310
game plan what people are feeling what's

1136
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:54,110
motivating them that's what we're

1137
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:55,490
capturing but it's not tied to

1138
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:57,620
informations tied to demographics so 40

1139
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:01,900
year old men feel this way what have you

1140
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:06,940
no you're good yeah no that's a

1141
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:09,140
that's a great question and I'd say

1142
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,890
that's a concern so for example with we

1143
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:14,360
had it just now we sent it a press

1144
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,910
release this morning on the midterm

1145
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:19,430
elections and we had to be very careful

1146
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:21,380
we were the official pollster for tbo

1147
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,170
and we had our a I was able to determine

1148
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:26,630
if Andrew Horvath can get these writings

1149
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:29,030
she can win the election she has to get

1150
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,740
those writings it was like a path to

1151
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,570
victory if she didn't get them and that

1152
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,040
was how we we could tell early in the

1153
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,850
night that she you know wasn't gonna win

1154
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:40,910
but we were very careful but it's it's

1155
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:43,030
it's an internal decision that we make

1156
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:46,010
that we did not reveal those writing's

1157
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,560
on the air we revealed one just to kind

1158
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,080
of illustrate it and funny enough we

1159
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,570
then tracked it so we did reveal one of

1160
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,840
the writings and people in that like the

1161
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,790
parties descended on that writing and

1162
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:01,430
changed it change the outcome so it it

1163
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,620
definitely can happen and so we are very

1164
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,200
and you know do our people influenced by

1165
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,160
polls yes they are we can prove that

1166
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,900
absolutely so when you know there is

1167
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,760
that that's you know there have been

1168
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,160
questions about that before you know

1169
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,140
because the political parties hire their

1170
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,460
own pollsters and then they'll put at a

1171
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,800
poll and say oh the Liberals are winning

1172
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,520
or what-have-you

1173
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,890
that does influence people so that's

1174
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:28,040
true not only you know for an AI company

1175
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,650
it's true for any company and

1176
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:33,680
advertising what have you is the news

1177
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,750
influencing or is the poll that you're

1178
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,670
releasing it would have you influencing

1179
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,170
public opinion and we know that it does

1180
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:41,480
and it's not good for us because if we

1181
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,090
say you know they're going to win by 24

1182
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:46,640
seats and and here are the 80 districts

1183
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,530
where it's contentious than those people

1184
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:50,180
okay I better get out and vote now

1185
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,100
because I'm in one of those 80 districts

1186
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,870
you change the outcome and then my

1187
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:58,130
forecast looks wrong right so it so but

1188
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:02,420
we are conscious of that and and it is a

1189
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,460
risk that's all I can say it's a risk

1190
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,960
for everybody that we do influence

1191
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,810
public opinion with this information

1192
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:09,640
well thank you very much Aaron

1193
