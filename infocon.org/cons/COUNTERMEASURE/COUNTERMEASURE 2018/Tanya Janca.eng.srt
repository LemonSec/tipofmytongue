[Music]

2
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:15,360
I'm gonna talk about like well let's do

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,859
this okay so in reality a lot of so I

4
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,740
also have done like some consulting and

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,640
then then I moved to Microsoft and I

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,900
don't have to actually solve the

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,539
incidents there which is awesome but I

8
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,070
still report them and kind of help them

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,829
figure out what's happening and a lot of

10
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,840
places are not ready for this type of

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,550
incident they're like I know what to do

12
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,460
with ransomware got that I know to do

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,469
with malware I can format machines like

14
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:44,910
no one's business but then when it comes

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,010
to like a weird software thing like

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,350
you've created a custom app and someone

17
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,140
is broken into your app people are like

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,870
why I only like theirs so I was looking

19
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,340
for a playbook on this and I couldn't

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,570
find one so I'm like I'm gonna write a

21
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,850
talk about all of the weird ideas in my

22
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,260
head of what I've been doing the past

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,850
four or five years when I respond to

24
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,689
incidents and I hope that you like that

25
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:10,799
because I made most this up okay so okay

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,180
where we going to talk about today so

27
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,890
we're gonna talk almost only about

28
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,500
incident preparation and then we're

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,909
going to talk about during an incident

30
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,830
because ideally if you have prepared

31
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,100
really really well for incidents you

32
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,040
might not have them okay so this is me

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,530
sometimes this is me and I'm Tanya

34
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,140
Jenkins purple and yes this it's purple

35
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,650
at the end I'm a giant nerd and I work

36
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,270
for this little startup you might have

37
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,979
heard of us we are called Microsoft I

38
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:45,990
was something called a senior cloud

39
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,939
developer advocate and I didn't know

40
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,829
what that was either so I made a slide

41
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:52,530
about what it means it means I do all of

42
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,570
these things I get feedback from the

43
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,759
community I do security research and

44
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,549
release it for free and basically I want

45
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,159
to learn what people actually want our

46
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,060
stuff to do

47
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,560
from a security perspective so it

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,119
actually works so then we can change it

49
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:06,540
for you

50
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,810
because yeah so I don't sell things I'm

51
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,068
just a diode

52
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,920
and I consider myself an application

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,389
security evangelist but not like this

54
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:20,519
guy more like this guy yeah including

55
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,090
the sparkles and so I am a like an

56
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,370
ethical hacker because I want to look

57
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,400
inside and I'm totally obsessed with a

58
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,500
wasp which is an international nonprofit

59
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,989
organization and I help run the chapter

60
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:38,790
here in Ottawa with chapters all around

61
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,069
the world and all we want to do is just

62
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:42,659
help everyone make more secure software

63
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:44,370
so like I have a project and I have a

64
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,349
chapter and I'm ridiculously obsessed

65
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:48,780
and I'll talk about them a lot and if

66
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,939
you don't like them I don't know if we

67
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:54,389
can be friends I'm sorry so I run the

68
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:57,449
chapter and then I have a project and I

69
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:59,280
just started a thing called cyber ladies

70
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,659
so all the women in the room you're

71
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:02,430
invited I haven't meet up and we just

72
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,530
brunch like badasses we crash boy

73
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,629
meetups together we teach each other

74
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:08,370
give each other workshops and it's like

75
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,590
ladies only so you're all invited just

76
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,239
so you know look us up on Meetup and

77
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,739
those are like our chapter in Israel

78
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,199
those ladies are from Israel and so I

79
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,019
have been coding for a really long time

80
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:23,549
and I have a goal for my career which is

81
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:25,019
why do all these talks and like why I

82
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,780
took this been like why I work too much

83
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,810
I feel like it's way too hard to make

84
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,370
software secure right now I feel like

85
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,379
the default way that we do things is

86
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,079
insecure for everything all technology

87
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:41,009
and I would like it if the default way

88
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:43,169
to do anything the easiest way to do the

89
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:45,329
thing was the secure way and right now

90
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:47,879
that's not the way so that is what I'm

91
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,680
personally working on but that is like a

92
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,810
lot about me and instead I think we

93
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,930
should talk about instant response okay

94
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,370
so first I'm gonna start with

95
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,900
definitions I'm sorry if some of this

96
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,489
bores you a little bit if you already

97
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,439
like respond to incidents 24/7 and you

98
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,889
know my silly lingo but this will be

99
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:06,689
over in like two minutes okay

100
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:09,000
so what is pushing left so this is my

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,949
favorite topic so when we build software

102
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:12,389
we do this thing called the system

103
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:13,739
development lifecycle that looks like

104
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,709
that and if you do DevOps or agile you

105
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,839
just do like littler circulars like more

106
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,409
circles that's it but no matter what you

107
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:23,849
need to know what you're building you

108
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:24,610
need to

109
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,500
map out what you're going to build you

110
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,090
do a lot of coding which i think is the

111
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,080
fun part you test it and you release it

112
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,009
the further left you look on this screen

113
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:38,169
see my awesome animations I should have

114
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:42,789
become an animator the further left you

115
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:44,259
go the earlier are you in the system

116
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:45,939
development lifecycle so when I say

117
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:47,949
pushing left it's because like so many

118
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:50,020
of the jobs I've had I come in at the

119
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,460
end when the software is already built

120
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,189
everything's done right so I want to try

121
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:56,439
to push everyone to allow me to start

122
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,520
earlier I want to be there for

123
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,750
requirements I want to be there for

124
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,759
design and this is what all application

125
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,259
security people want we want to be

126
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:04,270
invited to the original kick-off party

127
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,009
for your project and we want to be there

128
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:08,259
the whole way through so this is pushing

129
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:10,419
left so doing security from the start

130
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:13,379
okay so now what is pushing right okay

131
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,939
this is what has happened at a lot of

132
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:18,009
places that I have talked to consulted

133
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:21,849
etc it's where you wait until the end to

134
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:24,159
look at security and then everything's

135
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:27,189
on fire and then you call me at 4:00 in

136
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:29,229
the morning and I'm like who gave you my

137
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:36,219
number and and so if you wait until the

138
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:37,870
end it's not going to be pretty

139
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,089
right when if this is the first time

140
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,279
you've looked at security like it's

141
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:46,150
gonna be bad and so incidents are the

142
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,300
most expensive humiliating an awful

143
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,699
damaging way to deal with security for

144
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:54,219
the first time right so yes sometimes

145
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:55,839
even if you do app SEC you might have

146
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,490
instance at the end but all the places

147
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,199
I've worked at that have great app sack

148
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,210
very few incidents so yes so I will joke

149
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,860
that places are like oh you're really

150
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,060
pushing right with that aren't you

151
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,060
awesome and that's what I mean it's like

152
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,319
you're calling me in at the end why are

153
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:13,539
you doing this okay so what is a

154
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,689
security incident or security event does

155
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:18,849
anyone want to be super brave and put

156
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:21,279
their hand up because if you do if you

157
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,930
answer one of my questions or you ask a

158
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,339
question at the end you get a maple

159
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:25,810
candy and I know we're in Ottawa so this

160
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,550
is way less exciting but they're

161
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,020
delicious and they're my favorite candy

162
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,139
and I'm sure they cost a couple pennies

163
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:34,300
and does anyone want to venture what's

164
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,589
the difference between an incident or an

165
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:37,800
event

166
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:59,740
yeah that was amazing that's like it

167
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,280
like it basically said my slides so

168
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,180
security vents when something strange

169
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,710
happens something has happened but you

170
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,120
don't know what's going on or you think

171
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,070
something's happening but then an

172
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,660
incident is when something has happened

173
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,010
and it's go time now we're clear we're

174
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,500
good I know that you saw talks all day

175
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,700
yesterday and then you've probably got

176
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,650
wicked drunk at the party or the

177
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,090
networking thing and then now you're

178
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,590
like oh my god it's morning but I'm

179
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,090
hoping you had like enough coffee so

180
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,850
that you're like yeah let's do this

181
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:32,169
because I have I'm pumped okay so here

182
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:33,760
is an example of a security incident you

183
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,880
find your data for sale on the dark web

184
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,350
that's not an event something has

185
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,200
happened

186
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,840
[Music]

187
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,510
okay so Incident Response this is an

188
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,600
organized response so when an incident

189
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,190
happens so this isn't like a

190
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,479
free-for-all and we all run around like

191
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,530
this because that's what my first

192
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,570
incident looked like I had no training I

193
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,620
was just like so this is it's organized

194
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,260
and you try to first of all like shut

195
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,669
everything down make sure everything's

196
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:05,260
okay stop whatever is happening from

197
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,120
happening more and then like you figure

198
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,340
out the damage you fix things you brief

199
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,349
upper management get yelled at and then

200
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:14,530
everything's fine but it's but it's true

201
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,740
and you try especially to reduce the

202
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,930
recovery time and the costs and

203
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,000
especially the cost to your reputation

204
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,500
right so sometimes something is

205
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,789
happening you're not sure how bad it is

206
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:26,229
and then like the media will jump to

207
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:28,060
conclusions and be like this is

208
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,070
happening because like we all know the

209
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,799
media doesn't like basically like you

210
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,150
tweet a thing and then like everyone

211
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,219
repeats in its fact now even though it's

212
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:37,479
like but that guy does anyone work there

213
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,380
right so so you have to make media

214
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,620
quotes and it's awful trust me okay so

215
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,510
what is app sec what application

216
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,520
security which I refer to as app sec

217
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,410
because it's a lot of syllable

218
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,319
and I say it a lot okay so it's every

219
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:55,940
and any activity that you perform to

220
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,329
ensure your software is secure and I

221
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:02,329
said that I quote myself in talks a lot

222
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:03,620
because I feel like it looks more

223
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,949
interesting and yeah I do what I can

224
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:08,779
okay so that's what that's what it is

225
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:11,449
it's the security of software right it's

226
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:12,800
like the things that you do to try to

227
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,360
make sure your software is secure and if

228
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,670
you are let's say you know there's a

229
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,980
function you used to use a lot and then

230
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,750
it's been found to be super vulnerable

231
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,160
like this third-party component and you

232
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,170
just grep through all your source code

233
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,750
looking for it and removing it you are

234
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,389
doing application security right if you

235
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:31,610
are reviewing someone else's code to

236
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,470
make sure that it's secure that's

237
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,610
application security if you have hired a

238
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,990
person like me to come in and like kick

239
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:39,949
your app around

240
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:41,990
that's application security all of those

241
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,300
things are if you're fixing security

242
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,730
bugs application security okay so oh

243
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,759
yeah I forgot so I mean I like one one

244
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,269
two more minutes we have a whole hour

245
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:57,620
okay so application security is a thing

246
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,769
poor app set causes 29 to 40 percent of

247
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:03,079
breaches so I say 29 because one year it

248
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:04,579
was that and the other year is 40

249
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:06,800
percent this is has anyone read the

250
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,790
Verizon breach report I read the summary

251
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:15,589
basically they take account of all of

252
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:17,750
those things and number one every year

253
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,120
has been software people are breaking

254
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,529
into software you used to be networks

255
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:23,689
and operating systems and then some of

256
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,279
the people that make operating systems

257
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,839
got their act together and made more

258
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:28,220
secure operating systems and now the

259
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,170
easiest way in is custom apps also they

260
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,610
don't really teach this in school yet

261
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,360
and I am doing some volunteer work for

262
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,000
the government to try to help with that

263
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,100
because like when we teach a software

264
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,110
developer to code we teach to them ok so

265
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,970
hello world it goes out to the screen

266
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,759
who here's done hello world right the

267
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,709
next thing they teach you is okay so

268
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:54,290
let's read some what is your name and

269
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,029
then the person puts it in and then you

270
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:57,769
take it and then you put it onto the

271
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:00,769
screen so that is cross-site scripting

272
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:02,990
right there

273
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,700
100% the way they teach you is wrong

274
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,330
every time and so this is a big problem

275
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,230
and I'm working on it and yeah okay

276
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,870
so now let's talk about preparation so

277
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,220
this is going to be the meat of the talk

278
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,020
and I'm gonna go through like a whole

279
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,360
bunch of different things that you can

280
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,360
do to prepare so that you don't have an

281
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,880
incident or at least when an incident

282
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,130
does happen you are this hot knife

283
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,840
cutting through butter like I know what

284
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,060
I'm doing let's do this and minimal

285
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,480
damage everything happens fast good

286
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,490
resolutions resolutions where no one's

287
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,490
yelling okay so an ounce of prevention

288
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,450
is worth a pound of cure this is maybe

289
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,760
even more exponential than that okay so

290
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,450
number one hmm so I'm gonna give you the

291
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,460
most obvious advice ever is anyone want

292
00:11:53,460 --> 00:12:00,420
guess what this avais is mmm okay so

293
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,040
that is really good but that's not it

294
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,950
but you dessert but if you gets a candy

295
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:12,960
oh my gosh that guy gets a candy to come

296
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,120
off and ask me after okay the most the

297
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,520
most obvious advice ever for for making

298
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,220
sure that you don't have incidents Pat

299
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,930
your servers and upgrade your frameworks

300
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,130
is this difficult yes I upgraded my

301
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,540
framework so I of this open-source

302
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,530
project and of course I wrote it in

303
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,750
dotnet code cuz I work for Microsoft and

304
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,620
I upgrade it from like one to two and it

305
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,040
was hard so I feel your pain I broke all

306
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,420
sorts of things and then I had to fix

307
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,590
them and then it was fine

308
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,630
right but my app was down a week because

309
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,360
it's my side project for fun but you you

310
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,300
really need to so keep your frameworks

311
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,150
up-to-date so if you let's say you are

312
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,430
using struts which I'm really sorry for

313
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,560
you in the first place I'm sorry

314
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,370
but it like going from 1.0 to two point

315
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,070
whatever that's that's really hard but

316
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,480
if you're going from two to two point

317
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,460
one that's a lot easier and if you just

318
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,580
keep current you'll have a lot less

319
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:15,190
obviously big huge holes in your apps

320
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,440
and your life will be better like I know

321
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,150
in the short term it's really easy to

322
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,300
not upgrade and like not patch things

323
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,490
and not but it's always easy to do a

324
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,950
shitty job right because that's what's

325
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,080
happening right like if you're like 20

326
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,910
things behind it's like well they're

327
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,550
like we didn't have time I'm like okay

328
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,130
next Pat your servers please obvious

329
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,080
everyone everyone agrees with this

330
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,900
advice but so there's me begging and

331
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,280
then see this is fine it's not fine it's

332
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,820
not fine and then it's not fine so this

333
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,440
is my number one advice and I know this

334
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,760
is really hard to do and I know that

335
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,830
some of you work for the government and

336
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,940
you have someone else in charge of

337
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,170
patching your servers who you don't have

338
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,110
power over and so you know I feel that

339
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,190
pain because I used to work for the

340
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,770
government but also you can still

341
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,140
upgrade your frameworks you I believe

342
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,390
you have the power to do that and it's

343
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,310
so worth it it's so worth it it's really

344
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,410
great when like an honourable D comes in

345
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,120
like an old framework I'm like that's

346
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,910
not me don't work like there's not an

347
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,050
incident there's not an event there's

348
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,470
nothing right okay so next instant

349
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,960
response for your organization so who

350
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,390
here has an incident response process

351
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,210
and knows it

352
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,310
Legg knows their role in it their role

353
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,380
right because like if you're on the

354
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,640
incident response team you have a much

355
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,750
bigger role than if you're a software

356
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,810
developer good I dream of the day where

357
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,030
everyone puts their hand out because

358
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,340
even if you are not like if you work in

359
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,990
helpdesk you have a role in instant

360
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,580
response and sometimes it's just call

361
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,140
the security team be like this looks bad

362
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,080
right and don't touch it don't manage it

363
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,400
yourself

364
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,440
I worked somewhere once and we had an

365
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,140
incident and I went over to this leader

366
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,460
of this other team and I was like

367
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,620
breathing fire on him I super pissed I'm

368
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,850
like why did you do this you're erased

369
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,040
all the evidence blah blah blah blah why

370
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,330
do you follow the process he's like we

371
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,830
have an instant response process and I

372
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,540
was like oh my god it's me it's my fault

373
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,780
I hadn't I'd taken over for someone else

374
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,210
and I had no idea that no one in all of

375
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,640
IT knew what they were supposed to do if

376
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,620
there's an incident so someone from

377
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,930
helpdesk tried really hard to manage it

378
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,589
himself

379
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:25,470
you have to DUP royally but the point is

380
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,460
but the point is like he was trying

381
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,600
really hard cuz he didn't know what to

382
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,460
do and he like did the Valiants thing

383
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,420
right but then I taught everyone like I

384
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,740
expect this from you I expect that from

385
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,630
you I need this from you right and then

386
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,190
everyone knew what to do and then I got

387
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,690
a lot more phone calls because people

388
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,730
would report things and it was great and

389
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:43,960
then we could fix them right away

390
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,550
instead of when like all hell broke

391
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,350
loose okay

392
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,220
so create an instant response process

393
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,270
teach every person that you know train

394
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:59,320
people what you expect from them this is

395
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,060
an important one refresh once a year I

396
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,210
worked somewhere once or no I was called

397
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,160
in somewhere to give training there

398
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,690
consulting with me should we get trip or

399
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,740
should we have training and I was like

400
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,750
when was last time you gave them

401
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,320
training like 2012 and it was 2016 and

402
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,910
I'm like so four years ago you gave

403
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,800
developers one course on security and

404
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,140
you've had no turnover you've had no no

405
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,850
no employees you feel the same things

406
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,890
are valid now is where then and they're

407
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:28,840
like oh so keep once a year it's good so

408
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,340
everyone needs to know what to do if

409
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,640
they suspect an incident and I ever went

410
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,710
in IT as a role even if it's please just

411
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,610
don't touch anything

412
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,470
just don't touch anything and call us

413
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:42,400
right if you find images that are

414
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,260
clearly illegal and disturbing don't

415
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,730
touch anything just leave your computer

416
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,260
and no we'll just go call right away

417
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,740
don't look Jesus you can't unsee things

418
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,270
right and that's not your job and you

419
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,770
shouldn't have to deal with something

420
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:58,930
awful like that okay so here are some

421
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,270
resources for like specific incident

422
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,680
response processes that you could

423
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,780
theoretically use where you work if you

424
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,069
don't have one so you can like kind of

425
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:09,160
copy theirs and then because it's smart

426
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,230
to not reinvent the wheel copy something

427
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,119
cool and then change it so it works for

428
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,609
you that's that's what programming is

429
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:17,829
right like you just code for a little

430
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,910
bit there I don't know how to do that

431
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,089
and you go on Stack Overflow you take

432
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,440
whatever the thing is it looks again you

433
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,910
paste it in it compiles your like score

434
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,660
I'm an awesome programmer there's gonna

435
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,310
be a bunch of parts where I give you

436
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,870
resources so you might want to take

437
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,850
pictures but all these slides are also

438
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,610
on the internet so you can already go

439
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,779
get them and then the

440
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:39,249
is gonna be a video of this at some

441
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:41,889
point when they feel like releasing it

442
00:17:41,889 --> 00:17:44,859
okay so training so instant response

443
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:47,619
teams are expensive I feel they're

444
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:49,899
they're worth it if you need one if you

445
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:51,340
work somewhere and it's really little

446
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,929
and you have Turner employees your

447
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:55,090
instant response team might be named

448
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,869
Fred or Jen and that person just knows

449
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,489
when they need to call someone bigger

450
00:18:00,489 --> 00:18:02,379
and they know how to format machines

451
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:04,389
that have malware and that's it maybe

452
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:08,349
that's all you need right but they need

453
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:11,859
incident response training they need

454
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:14,789
forensics training

455
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,129
I advise blue team exercises and red

456
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:22,509
team exercises who here's blue team if

457
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:24,789
you are a defender you're a blue team if

458
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:29,379
you if you write code you are probably a

459
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:30,969
blue team because whatever you write you

460
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:34,419
want it to not be insecure red team is

461
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:36,729
when you attack things so when I do

462
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:39,489
security testing I'm red team which is

463
00:18:39,489 --> 00:18:43,419
why I call myself purple team but most

464
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:45,729
of us NIT our blue team which is awesome

465
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:46,869
because we need more defenders than

466
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:49,629
attackers but these exercises are so

467
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,309
good to do with your incident response

468
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:54,429
team so you can train them up nicely

469
00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:57,489
another thing is incident simulation I

470
00:18:57,489 --> 00:18:59,769
used to work for Elections Canada and I

471
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:01,149
don't know if you know but they do an

472
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:04,149
entire election six months before the

473
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:05,859
real one they do a practice one they

474
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:08,379
build an office they put all of the ID

475
00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:10,690
in it they hire hackers to defend on it

476
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,700
they throw fake incidents in and the

477
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,589
staff have to act like it's real and

478
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:17,409
then they learn a ton and then they fix

479
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:19,269
things so that when the election happens

480
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:21,909
is just smooth like butter right so

481
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:24,249
incident simulations where you work our

482
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:26,619
great idea just so you people know what

483
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:30,219
to do they need training and detection

484
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:32,200
they need to know about monitoring and

485
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,659
all sorts of other things like it's the

486
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:36,789
point is it's going to be expensive it's

487
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:39,460
not going to be super cheap if you're a

488
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,629
very small place again you don't

489
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:41,889
necessarily need your own instant

490
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,789
response team it's up to you okay who

491
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:48,989
here is used and Matt before

492
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:54,440
if you are in a traditional data center

493
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,270
okay who here has a complete list of

494
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,820
every single application that their

495
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,080
company has made no hands that's right

496
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,520
cuz I cuz I you're like elbow like we we

497
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,530
have half them documented most of us

498
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,300
don't write but a thing you can do is

499
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,920
you can take n Maps could scan your

500
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,750
perimeter just scan the crap out of

501
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,340
everything scan every single thing and

502
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,260
look and see where your custom apps are

503
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,740
if port 443 or 80 are open stuffs

504
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,460
happening also close per eighty HTTP

505
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,470
only so nmap is your friend it's freaky

506
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:35,130
it's not that hard to use I've done it

507
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,390
you can do it trust me

508
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,100
it's like if you're smart enough to work

509
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,090
on IT you control they use n map however

510
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,170
you want to use it to create an

511
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,970
inventory of all your app so this is

512
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,350
like the first Super application

513
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,910
security thing if you don't know where

514
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,960
it is how can you defend it right cavea

515
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,460
if you're in the cloud and map is

516
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,680
unnecessary so I work for a cloud

517
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,690
provider but we're all the same like

518
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,270
basically and all of them you can see

519
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,880
everything that is in your subscription

520
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,230
unless someone has taken their credit

521
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,750
card and gone somewhere else and paid

522
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,030
for cloud somewhere else so that it's

523
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,820
not being paid for by you everything

524
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,080
should be in your subscription and then

525
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,220
you have like a perfect view there's

526
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,450
just like a button you're like Oh show

527
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,770
me my dashboard and there's all your

528
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,320
stuff so this is nothing you need to do

529
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,660
if you're in the cloud however if you

530
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,890
have an employee that goes and takes a

531
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,480
credit card and goes out and buy some

532
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,970
stuff that should not be allowed under

533
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,970
your domain right so you should be

534
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,940
switching domains as you go to it right

535
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,350
so again this is the thing where it

536
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,090
should be like pretty obvious to you and

537
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,500
your customers like this something's not

538
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,050
right here try not to let your employees

539
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,320
do that instead actually like serve them

540
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,340
give them the things they need to do

541
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,430
their jobs and they won't do that to you

542
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:51,150
off topic ok so no matter what you need

543
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,890
application inventory so you're gonna

544
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:56,340
make an Excel spreadsheet that is the

545
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,270
most useful file of where you work as an

546
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,950
incident responder because when an

547
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:02,370
incident

548
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,190
happens if you so someone's like oh you

549
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,890
know XYZ app is down Oh what the hell's

550
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,930
that where is it I don't even have a

551
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,510
link to it who's in charge of it right

552
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,370
you go to this and then you're like oh

553
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,860
oh like you can automate a thing to have

554
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,230
just an map around every month or every

555
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,260
week it's up to you right but if you

556
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,580
don't know where your stuff is and you

557
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,020
don't know who's in charge of it like

558
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,090
you're already you're super lost I have

559
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,590
had incidents where like this thing is

560
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,880
down and does anyone know where that

561
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,280
thing is or what it does

562
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,480
whose interactive it go to I call bad is

563
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,170
not helpful at like especially if it's

564
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,690
late even 6:00 p.m. most people are gone

565
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,429
right and you're like I am in so much

566
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:45,120
trouble right now

567
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,580
and so this is the most important step I

568
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,230
feel besides patching all of your

569
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,179
servers and everything okay

570
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:52,650
so you can't protect it if you don't

571
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,410
know that you have it so document your

572
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,320
tech stack right how many people are

573
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,570
using no every single thing in their

574
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,740
tech stack we made ours so I know right

575
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,809
most of us like I've worked places where

576
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:07,740
they're like oh and then there's that

577
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,540
team that just uses Ruby I'm like what

578
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,429
we're a Java shop why are they're like

579
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:14,120
oh they like it

580
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,550
oh well then right if you don't even

581
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,290
know what you have how can you protect

582
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,540
against it because if you know that you

583
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,309
have this one group that uses Ruby then

584
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:24,660
you know that you need to keep your eye

585
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,809
on things regarding Ruby so all the

586
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:29,610
programming languages you use all the

587
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,550
API is that you call they aren't yours

588
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,860
libraries who here knows all of the

589
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,419
components they're in all of their apps

590
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,450
right but you can document this there's

591
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,280
tools that will do it for you a wasp has

592
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,490
one called dependency check and it will

593
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,290
scan your code and it will tell you the

594
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,150
list of all the libraries that you're

595
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,530
using and it will tell you which ones

596
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:56,220
are vulnerable score what operating

597
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,610
systems and what versions configuration

598
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,900
settings who here is using

599
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,700
infrastructure as code if you do that

600
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,020
all your configurations can be in your

601
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,340
code so then you don't really even have

602
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,980
to document it because it's there to

603
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,490
birds firewall rules I'm not going to

604
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,970
get to yes

605
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,870
yes yes you can automate your

606
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,910
documentation with infrastructure as

607
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:29,390
code and that is like such a huge bonus

608
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,800
like it's already cool but that makes it

609
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,630
way better from a security auditing

610
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,490
person source standpoint I don't do

611
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,470
audits but I have to like report to

612
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,060
people that do them sometimes and like

613
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,190
it it's really painful if you don't know

614
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,630
where anything is so they don't like

615
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,880
that all your inputs and outputs and

616
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,700
integrations with other systems

617
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,980
seriously I need you to know this I know

618
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,560
this seems crazy but again you're gonna

619
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,300
add this also this magical Excel

620
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,590
spreadsheet that when an incident

621
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,850
happens you're going to be like this is

622
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,590
the most valuable piece of paper I've

623
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:02,160
ever had oh and then this is OS

624
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,370
dependency check okay so you want to

625
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:10,440
stay informed about threats who here has

626
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,420
a threat feed big companies usually pay

627
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,460
for a threat feed that's pretty sweet if

628
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,870
you work for the Canadian government you

629
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,960
already have one it's called JC cert

630
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,600
read their emails and respond they're

631
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,610
there they're really good I know people

632
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,190
like to hate on SSE but like I think JC

633
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,480
so it's kind of awesome they do a lot of

634
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,510
good stuff for you oh let's go back I

635
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,150
have an awesome SSC story I had to call

636
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,530
them because there's an incident that I

637
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:37,620
couldn't manage is too big for me it's

638
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,690
like I guess some people are was that

639
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,280
hard on your ego and like no I was like

640
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,960
oh my gosh my hair is on fire I need

641
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,560
help

642
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,600
I didn't even it didn't even occur to me

643
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,190
to be like I can handle this I'm

644
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,680
whatever and they were amazing and they

645
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,140
called an IT cert and they were amazing

646
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,450
and we called a private company and paid

647
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:57,210
them as much as my house costs I don't

648
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,440
know I don't know how much we paid them

649
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,310
but it was more than I get paid and I

650
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,500
t-shirt and GC said kick their butt they

651
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,900
got results faster more accurate it was

652
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,030
great and so if you work for the

653
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,560
government you have an awesome team

654
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,090
behind you of people that really know

655
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:12,630
what they're doing

656
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,700
I know people really like to hate SSC

657
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,070
but hate them for the right reasons and

658
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:21,510
that's not one okay so follow so see

659
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,820
Cirque again a Canadian government thing

660
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,470
they have an IRS feed where they'll tell

661
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,000
you about threats and it's free for

662
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,990
everyone it's free

663
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,900
for it's made for Canadians but everyone

664
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,560
can use it review their bulletins and

665
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,860
technical reports there's a us-cert it's

666
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,970
on the internet which means you can

667
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,830
still read it right if it's free why not

668
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,770
benefit swamp in a box which is like

669
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,470
more advanced stuff hmm I don't use it

670
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,690
but it was suggested to me as a possible

671
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,160
resource and you might want to use it

672
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,190
and more threats you can register to

673
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:59,010
known software vendors so if you use

674
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:02,160
oracle register with them to get updates

675
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,550
right if you use Microsoft if you use

676
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,070
Apple whatever the big names are that

677
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,630
you're using they probably have a feed

678
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,490
if you're a big customer they'd be happy

679
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:14,190
to send it to you listen the podcast

680
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,200
amount or Twitter who here finds out

681
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,770
about vulnerabilities on Twitter first

682
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,530
that's actually why I joined Twitter her

683
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,880
because Jaron want to cry I kept asking

684
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,190
my friend Shannon lead what's happening

685
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,080
with she's like I need you to grow up

686
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,880
Tanya and act like an InfoSec adult and

687
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,320
get Twitter yes ma'am

688
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,860
she was right though signing up for

689
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,330
security and update notifications for

690
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:44,760
every product and your text bag every

691
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,070
single one I know that it's like oh this

692
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,500
is such crap spam but when it tells you

693
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,690
by the way this there's an exploit and

694
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,280
it's in the wild and this is what it

695
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,560
looks like then you can do I have some

696
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,620
protections for you for 0 days so

697
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,510
maunder recent breaches of other

698
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,890
companies and see if you can learn from

699
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,040
it so Equifax that was a stretch to

700
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,330
vulnerability so if you are running

701
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,520
strats and you're running vulnerable

702
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,110
versions like learn from their mistake

703
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,520
everyone's going to make fun of your

704
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,380
seaso for have a music degree instead of

705
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:18,480
a an InfoSec degree also like millions

706
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,160
of dollars of losses and personal

707
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,240
information lost so I try really hard to

708
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,040
learn from others mistakes so I don't

709
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,750
make the same mistake I want to make my

710
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,020
own mistakes but but seriously all of

711
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,550
these things are great resources and I

712
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:35,250
suggest you sign up okay next slide next

713
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,660
top Oh anything else you can think of

714
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:41,789
great okay so oh I made more slides

715
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:42,989
countermeasure wanted to have some cloud

716
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:45,629
and like I've got cloud so turn on

717
00:28:45,629 --> 00:28:47,970
threat protection so every single cloud

718
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,409
provider has like a lot of the same

719
00:28:49,409 --> 00:28:51,600
things and you can take advantage of

720
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,190
them so there's that protection that

721
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,229
will protect like databases and it's

722
00:28:55,229 --> 00:28:56,999
just like that that looks bad it's kind

723
00:28:56,999 --> 00:28:58,789
of like a laugh but for your database

724
00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:01,799
turn on all your monitoring turn on

725
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,200
every single security feature so all of

726
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,729
them have different security features

727
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:06,960
and you're just like whichever cloud

728
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,309
you're using just be like flip flip flip

729
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:11,970
flip flip they tend to cost less than

730
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:14,159
third party security tools because you

731
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,599
will get a whole bunch of them from your

732
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,580
cloud provider instead of like one from

733
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,509
each different vendor yeah so whatever

734
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,220
security dashboard they offer just turn

735
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,779
it on and oh yeah contact information

736
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:33,720
add a phone number so like not to get to

737
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,460
Microsoft II on you but I work there and

738
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,840
we have like these recommendations in

739
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,940
our cloud and it's now high alert if you

740
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,349
don't have a phone number of someone

741
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:41,820
they can call if like your clouds on

742
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,919
fire like people don't put their phone

743
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,090
number I'm like why would you not put

744
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,590
your phone number oh my gosh don't you

745
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,029
want to call it's like literally it's

746
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:49,349
like oh well we're pretty sure you've

747
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:52,879
made a lot of Bitcoin in the past hour

748
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:56,820
is that yours have you decided to do

749
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,970
that pyramid scheme some of us were

750
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,070
ranting last night about Bitcoin like

751
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,659
how we're using all this energy for

752
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:09,029
nothing I'm gonna okay so this will only

753
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:11,190
protect you against you have sex issues

754
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,049
there's more apps tech issues but these

755
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:15,029
things can help it's not going to do

756
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:16,470
complete coverage it's not like a laughs

757
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:20,340
oh I'm gonna get too wet oh APHA's get a

758
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:25,049
wife okay so what is oh f it is a

759
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:27,330
firewall but at the application level

760
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,429
instead of the networking level right so

761
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:32,729
everything that comes in to your app it

762
00:30:32,729 --> 00:30:34,799
looks at it the requests and responses I

763
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,149
think going in things going out it's

764
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:37,739
like that doesn't look right so if

765
00:30:37,739 --> 00:30:42,389
something comes in and it's like you

766
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:46,979
know like single tick or equals or one

767
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:50,340
equals one that might be an SQL

768
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,820
injection yes and then this would look a

769
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,899
tango

770
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:58,409
No No so Olaf makes one I know I said

771
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:00,649
I'd talk about them a lot that's free

772
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:04,349
curity and then it has rules called the

773
00:31:04,349 --> 00:31:06,690
court rule set so the wife is separate

774
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,909
than the rules you don't have to

775
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:10,950
implement the rule if you don't want to

776
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,719
I know everyone here is like why would

777
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:14,369
you implement a wife and then not

778
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:16,409
implement the rules if you don't have

779
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:18,809
professionals to run the rules who's

780
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:22,289
running the rules can be complex you can

781
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:23,849
just have a wife for the sole reason

782
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:27,839
that when a zero-day is happening and

783
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:30,089
it's being exploited in the wild you can

784
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:31,950
create a custom signature you can create

785
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,950
one rule for that so in the instance of

786
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,320
stress - if you already have a laughs

787
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,119
you're like okay I just need a copy of

788
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,919
exploit and then anything that looks

789
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:43,139
remotely like this just block and then

790
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:44,580
you now have six to upgrade your

791
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,739
framework instead of six hours right so

792
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,839
I feel everyone should have a wife for

793
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:51,869
that one reason and since you can have a

794
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:55,499
free one it's pretty good so that's a

795
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:58,679
Web Application Firewall and okay so

796
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:01,799
what is it oh yeah I guess I said this

797
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:05,249
there but I like this that's what a wife

798
00:32:05,249 --> 00:32:10,499
is it's a shield it's literally a shield

799
00:32:10,499 --> 00:32:12,149
everything has to go through it or not

800
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:15,749
and it's like nope nope it's really

801
00:32:15,749 --> 00:32:18,769
helpful okay so enterprise security

802
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:21,839
that's not what this talk is about so

803
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,460
this talk is about a software security

804
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,589
and I'm skipping a lot of things and

805
00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:26,789
you're probably going to be like oh but

806
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:28,589
she's not talking about firewalls and it

807
00:32:28,589 --> 00:32:30,149
men rights and all of these things that

808
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:33,029
the security team likes to do to you I'm

809
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:34,289
not talking about those on purpose

810
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:35,549
because otherwise this would be a one

811
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:39,059
day training and so I'm skipping it on

812
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:41,039
purpose because sometimes before we but

813
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,389
you skip this so I'm just telling you

814
00:32:42,389 --> 00:32:43,589
like that's on purpose

815
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:48,899
okay so backups and roll backs so Hugh

816
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:51,899
who here does regular backups yeah yeah

817
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:55,369
who here does practices roll backs Oh

818
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:58,320
les hands good job oh did you just put

819
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,180
your elbow up now

820
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:04,270
um I worked somewhere once and a big bad

821
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,310
thing happened and then I said okay well

822
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:10,360
let's do let's do a rollback they

823
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,400
they're like oh well it's gonna take us

824
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,200
about a week to get a copy of the backup

825
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,330
and they'll take us three to four days

826
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,890
to figure out how to do it like well

827
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,510
we've lost one day's work for our entire

828
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,490
company and they were like we suggest

829
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,890
you redo it like can we fire all of them

830
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:27,580
like no it'll be seriously like your job

831
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,010
your one job like there was like a

832
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:33,700
backup team inland so practice your

833
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,790
backups I brought back seriously being

834
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,920
able to roll back is key so I worked at

835
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,230
another place and I remember I like I

836
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,180
was a programmer I'm well happy coding

837
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,920
and then I'd send like scripts to the

838
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,850
DBA and they're like where's your

839
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,920
rollback script I was like I don't need

840
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,150
one of those it's perfect I'm a

841
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:53,890
programmer and they're like no we

842
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,690
require a rollback script for everything

843
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,340
now and then we're gonna do it in tests

844
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,720
and then we're gonna roll it back and if

845
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,070
it doesn't look the exact same after

846
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,260
then you have to you have to start again

847
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,690
I was like why are they doing this to me

848
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,730
but now that I work in security I'm like

849
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,699
brilliant right so if they put it in and

850
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:12,190
something goes bad they can roll it back

851
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:16,449
I know this is extra work but it like

852
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:18,730
you can do things half-assed and you

853
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,739
those are the results you will get right

854
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:24,940
and us losing a complete day of work and

855
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,370
then the backup team telling us like if

856
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,139
we worked all night for three days maybe

857
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,790
we could have it back then it's like oh

858
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,340
we'll never mind it's not worth it

859
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,469
I'm sure all of you have lost things at

860
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:39,000
some point who here does backups at home

861
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,168
awesome who here encrypts those backups

862
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:47,260
who here keeps the disk directly next to

863
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,580
their computer so if robbers come in

864
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,909
they'll get your disk and your computer

865
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:54,730
yeah so many people are like their

866
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,590
backups like right on top of their

867
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,050
computer Mike put in the linen closet

868
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,580
put in the kitchen somewhere but it's

869
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,720
somewhere else where you're not backing

870
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,130
up yeah yeah it's actively plugged in

871
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,960
and I totally get it because I used to

872
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,760
do that until I worked in security and

873
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,730
was like oh what am I worried about like

874
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,520
a flood or

875
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,440
I'm like Oh flutter Robert if it's right

876
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,610
on top Oh Tanya but if you do it on the

877
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:22,840
cloud as well then you're okay okay so

878
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,870
back up some rollbacks investigation

879
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:30,770
tools you need tools not during the

880
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,900
incident you need them before it's know

881
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,000
how to do them how to use them what they

882
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,730
do and they need to work with your

883
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:40,670
systems so you can't be like oh I have

884
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,410
the install files I'll install it later

885
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,940
you have to like use it and make sure it

886
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,980
can reach your app so I've worked places

887
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,990
where it's an incident or great here is

888
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:50,420
Nisus am i great I'm gonna scan it oh I

889
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,940
am on a different environment and it

890
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,320
can't reach that environment and there's

891
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,240
like 20,000 firewalls in between us and

892
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,860
all firewall people went home for the

893
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,580
day so I can't scan to see if we're

894
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,050
vulnerable to that I'm sorry

895
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,670
we're like am I allowed over there

896
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,740
they're like oh this guy's gone home

897
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:10,700
she's not so investigation tools you

898
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,340
need to see what's happening Metasploit

899
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,140
so I don't generally hang out with

900
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,780
Metasploit but if there is an exploit

901
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,570
that is live right now that's out and

902
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,700
there's no patch for it you can get a

903
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,920
copy of it by going on the web and doing

904
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,230
lots of searching and then you can make

905
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,390
your own module for it and then you can

906
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,580
test your app in a safe place right so

907
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,600
in a safe environment for testing

908
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,600
Nessus next Bo's open vaz for testing

909
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,390
operating systems don't use them to test

910
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,420
don't use them to test your app burp

911
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,360
suite pro and wasp zap one is almost

912
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,800
free one is free

913
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,840
compared to other web app scanning tools

914
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,150
so if someone tells me like oh this app

915
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,770
has cross-site scripting in it and like

916
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,240
if I haven't looked at it yet because I

917
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,350
have worked out places where they have

918
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,270
2000 apps and then they hire me and then

919
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,590
I'm like okay so I've looked at three

920
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,590
now right so there's one in there that

921
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,480
has this I'm it great can I go look at

922
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,250
it can I examine it need to have these

923
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:11,180
tools log viewing software who here has

924
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,720
ever looked at web server logs who

925
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,340
here's tried to open them in notepad and

926
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,050
been disappointed

927
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:23,770
so you need log viewing software okay

928
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,900
don't forget training and access it's so

929
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,490
important that you actually train the

930
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,690
team how to use it and you can't just

931
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,000
train Tanya I mean one person you have

932
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,200
to train more than just me like you

933
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,430
always have to have a backup person

934
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,990
because people go on vacation and all of

935
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:40,690
these things and although like I have a

936
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,010
bit of an ego and it's like super

937
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,360
exciting that people are helpless

938
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,950
without me that's not their right it's

939
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:45,940
not the right decision

940
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,460
right a lot of places have an IT person

941
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,710
that is like me where it's like yeah

942
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,880
that's right you can't live without me

943
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,400
and I know it's a bad attitude and I've

944
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,900
worked on it but when I was young I was

945
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,220
really bad for that I was like I know

946
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,600
how to do everything no one else I do

947
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:03,280
anything yeah but what you want is like

948
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,140
the perfect employee actually trains all

949
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,250
the other people so they know what

950
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:10,000
they're doing all right okay so if you

951
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,740
use the cloud it's slightly different

952
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,590
do I have oh wait no okay I don't have a

953
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,120
slide for that okay so if you use the

954
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,580
cloud is slightly different so you don't

955
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,520
mean necessarily as because all that is

956
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,620
built into your cloud I'm not just

957
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,820
speaking for mine all of them are the

958
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,550
same like we're all just copying each

959
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,770
other in case you haven't noticed it's

960
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,090
like oh that was a great idea let's do

961
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,010
it name it something else but it's

962
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,840
because you know you want to be awesome

963
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:39,040
so Metasploit yes next pose next you

964
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,270
don't need that the cloud will do it

965
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,160
burp suite and OS app yes but also

966
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,740
they're starting to roll out like web

967
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,900
app scanners in the clouds all the

968
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,250
clouds are starting to get them and by

969
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,140
that I mean they're buying cool ones and

970
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,870
then putting them in log viewing

971
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:53,860
software you don't need that because

972
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,840
that's built-in and training and access

973
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,850
you definitely need that you definitely

974
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,820
need that if people can't see they can't

975
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,340
see and all the same role based

976
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,960
authentication and all of that still

977
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,270
exists in the cloud and if anything it's

978
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,520
like worse because it's like it goes

979
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,260
down like this and like there's no oh

980
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,000
and then we just wracked the server over

981
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,320
here like everything is in line okay so

982
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,270
what should you log who wants to who

983
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,560
wants to name like a couple things that

984
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,410
you should log I got candy

985
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,570
No okay I'm gonna tell you the answer

986
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,790
that's fine that's fine I know you're

987
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,530
like she's a lot of candy up there I can

988
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,870
get one later okay so if you didn't log

989
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:38,830
it did it even happen if you don't log

990
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,520
things I am screwed

991
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,290
right I've worked places in there Oh

992
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,810
like still apps they don't do any log

993
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,670
supposed to know what happened I'm like

994
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,860
reading the stuff on the server and it's

995
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,440
big I don't know okay so if you rate

996
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,140
custom apps they need to do logging whoo

997
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,380
so which system or user executed this

998
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,870
event what what happened

999
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,090
raised it just an exception is it like a

1000
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:06,280
database except what happened even if

1001
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,510
you just hint what happened when they

1002
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:12,760
timestamp where so which part of the app

1003
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,720
did it happen it yes

1004
00:40:33,369 --> 00:41:02,469
it's a security question I think you

1005
00:41:02,469 --> 00:41:04,469
should advise them on it I think

1006
00:41:04,469 --> 00:41:07,239
anything that crashes any exceptions

1007
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:09,670
well get anything suspicious-looking

1008
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,410
from a security perspective that you

1009
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:13,960
would want to know log it and then ask

1010
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,150
them what their what their app does and

1011
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,809
then ask them more questions like when

1012
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:21,819
you do you threat modeling when you do

1013
00:41:21,819 --> 00:41:23,349
threat modeling with them they'll tell

1014
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:25,210
you what's important to them right so

1015
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,170
what keeps you up at night

1016
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,599
why is this app for like if something

1017
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:29,769
goes wrong with this app would is the

1018
00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:31,420
worst thing that can happen right what

1019
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,469
is the thing that would go wrong with

1020
00:41:32,469 --> 00:41:34,569
your app that makes you freak out right

1021
00:41:34,569 --> 00:41:36,519
and when you talk to the business is

1022
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:37,690
probably different answers than the

1023
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,839
security team or the developers have

1024
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:47,849
cool yes mm-hmm

1025
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:14,220
yeah if a security control fails you

1026
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,900
definitely log it like if someone tries

1027
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,700
to log in 50 times in one second that's

1028
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,580
probably bad if anything to do with the

1029
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,290
security control within your application

1030
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:27,440
like encryption things like that

1031
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,490
privilege role based stuff definitely

1032
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:35,610
yeah oh okay I have to hurry okay so do

1033
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,080
not log sensitive information such as

1034
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,570
passwords logs need to be saved to a

1035
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,710
different server than your app

1036
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,810
preferably consumable by the sim so

1037
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,940
we're like way behind sorry guys okay

1038
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,760
access don't make me ask you at 4 a.m.

1039
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,880
for access database logs web server logs

1040
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,940
source code credentials log viewer

1041
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,190
software I don't want to ask it for am

1042
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:01,680
for that no one's up code review

1043
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,120
software a safe place for me to destroy

1044
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:11,640
things I mean run exploits every single

1045
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,350
thing on the tools side you have to have

1046
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:15,390
access before the incident happens

1047
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,340
because it is so stressful to be like oh

1048
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:21,510
no I don't have that scheduled fire

1049
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,820
drills to test access every three months

1050
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:26,280
I know that sounds boring but I love it

1051
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,660
when an incident turns out boring

1052
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,980
because I just fix it and then

1053
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,950
everything's fine okay so disaster

1054
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:33,900
recovery we're way behind I'm sorry

1055
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,560
everyone who here has a death disaster

1056
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,410
recovery plan awesome who here has a

1057
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,950
business continuity plan yeah you need

1058
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:46,170
one you really do even if you're a small

1059
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,630
place so business continuity plan so

1060
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,310
what are the risks and how can you

1061
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:53,820
continue if this app fails backup

1062
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,910
locations cold warm or hot so at the

1063
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:00,030
cloud that's really easy there's

1064
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,140
literally a button

1065
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,060
I want my backups to be geographically

1066
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,880
located somewhere else but with a

1067
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,440
traditional data center this can be

1068
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,060
quite complicated and expensive

1069
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,160
what if critical infrastructure goes

1070
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,440
down what if all the power in your city

1071
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,410
goes down you have a plan cell phones

1072
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,570
landlines I worked somewhere once and

1073
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:23,430
their plan was paper they had there so

1074
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,320
they had like a computer system to

1075
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,170
report some results and then they had

1076
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,060
cell phones and then they had landlines

1077
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,190
then they had what are those satellite

1078
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,900
phones and then they were like if not

1079
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,450
we'll do it on paper we got this the

1080
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:38,490
results will be a little late can a post

1081
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:40,620
won't fail us like I'm so impressed and

1082
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,180
they thought about this because it was

1083
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,920
very important that all the science went

1084
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,470
where it was supposed to be the cloud

1085
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:49,190
can do stuff isn't that a great line so

1086
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:51,660
the cloud can do a lot of this for you

1087
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,020
all the clouds not just ours it's

1088
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,000
literally a button graphically locate

1089
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,290
that somewhere else please and it can do

1090
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,000
all sorts of crazy backup options for

1091
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,640
you all the cost money though incident

1092
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,860
simulation I believe that we should

1093
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,010
practice for incidents way in advance

1094
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:14,130
way in advance Oh oops

1095
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:17,610
okay I guess that's it okay so at least

1096
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:19,560
once per year I feel that you should

1097
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,660
insert like simulate and instantly

1098
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,310
everyone know you're simulating it and

1099
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,380
then see what helped us does see what

1100
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,090
the managers do see if the person

1101
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,440
reports it to you like they're supposed

1102
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,840
to or if they try to do it themselves if

1103
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,640
people do things wrong you know you need

1104
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,210
to give training again and everything

1105
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,930
ever all your apps and all your servers

1106
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:42,030
scan all the things I oughta mate scans

1107
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,680
get reports back I know they're not

1108
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,120
perfect and they miss things but damn

1109
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,600
they get a lot of things right then beg

1110
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,670
people to fix those things this is back

1111
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:54,000
to the first advice of patch all your

1112
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,770
servers and upgrade all your frameworks

1113
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:58,440
but seriously when you scan you'll see

1114
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,450
things we're missing you'll see things

1115
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,250
that you thought you had up-to-date but

1116
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,440
weren't scans double-check all of your

1117
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,670
work okay so this is not about a

1118
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:11,760
knapsack program so ideally you would

1119
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,590
have a good app sack program so you have

1120
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:14,660
way less incident

1121
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,190
so you would do all of those things and

1122
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:17,700
more

1123
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,980
that's all I like to talk about usually

1124
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,050
so you're welcome for talking about a

1125
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:26,160
different topic so I like talking about

1126
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,130
this anytime talk to me okay so during

1127
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:31,440
an incident this part is fast and then

1128
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,340
we'll go to questions

1129
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:35,700
okay so during an incident what now six

1130
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,530
steps and this is according to Stan's

1131
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:39,210
who here's how my friend Terry's talk

1132
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:44,940
yesterday it was very cloudy and she oh

1133
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,380
she's a sans instructor I'm like that

1134
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,670
doesn't make sense why I referenced you

1135
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:51,930
okay so number one preparation and

1136
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:55,170
triage why is happening right assign an

1137
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:57,570
incident manager everyone needs to know

1138
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:59,760
who the incident manager is go figure

1139
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,250
out what's happening to identification

1140
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,060
what is happening what is happening

1141
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,920
usually I'm like okay team this thing

1142
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,450
appears to have happened you'll have

1143
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:11,880
like 14 minutes to run off and go figure

1144
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,290
some stuff out come back and then we're

1145
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:14,640
gonna meet at this time I don't care if

1146
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,540
you're halfway through something you

1147
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,010
come back we're not going to wait for

1148
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,080
you tell us what's going on and then you

1149
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,310
have a much better picture because

1150
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,440
sometimes someone's stuck like oh I need

1151
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,120
another hour Mike I don't care come back

1152
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,460
if you're stuck maybe this person can

1153
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,660
help you right I don't know if you're

1154
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,560
not telling me contain it containment so

1155
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,600
they're short term and long term so for

1156
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,110
short term oops for short term first of

1157
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:38,700
all make sure the bleeding is done right

1158
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,100
is someone actually in full exfiltrating

1159
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:45,570
data right now if so you need to stop

1160
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:47,150
that right but then there's long term

1161
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:49,350
containment you want to make sure like

1162
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:51,230
you repair everything and fix everything

1163
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:56,970
and eradication you need to make sure no

1164
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:58,350
one's on your network you need to make

1165
00:47:58,350 --> 00:47:59,760
sure no one's in your app you probably

1166
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,140
need to go change a whole lot of

1167
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:04,590
passwords right or if there's ports open

1168
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,790
whatever it is you need to make sure

1169
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:07,590
that like you are now bulletproof from

1170
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:10,410
that from that instance or from that

1171
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:12,780
attack whatever it is that happened so

1172
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,160
this cannot happen to you again and then

1173
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,340
recovery so that's where you clean up I

1174
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:22,240
usually don't have to do that part

1175
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,580
usually developers have to do it thank

1176
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:29,390
you and ops people thank you yeah

1177
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:31,370
basically repair the damage store the

1178
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:32,720
systems make sure your business is back

1179
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,140
online

1180
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,670
everyone's doing all of their stuff and

1181
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:37,190
then post-mortem I believe this is the

1182
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:40,610
most important part so you everything's

1183
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,710
done ever everyone has gone home and

1184
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:44,690
slept and then you come back well it's

1185
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:45,950
fresh in your mind and you have a

1186
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:48,140
meeting with every single person

1187
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,240
involved that was part of that incident

1188
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,770
and you talked about it and you make

1189
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:54,860
notes and you're you pay attention

1190
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:57,140
because next time you might have similar

1191
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:00,710
problems I like - it's like I'm obsessed

1192
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:01,910
with data and metrics

1193
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:04,220
I love measuring stuff so I worked

1194
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,510
somewhere went and I took all of our

1195
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,310
incidents and then I classified them and

1196
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:10,190
it turned out 26% of them had to do with

1197
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:12,260
app sack and then I used that data to

1198
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,700
convince them to let me launch a

1199
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,460
knapsack program which was awesome I was

1200
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,870
like we have five types of incidents two

1201
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:19,550
of them are completely unavoidable and

1202
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:22,670
then these three are avoidable so let me

1203
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:23,900
make a plan for you

1204
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,030
to fix all three of them right this is

1205
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,650
stuff that you can do so that you don't

1206
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:30,470
have more incidents or at least if

1207
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:33,350
something like if I don't want someone

1208
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:35,900
to do a silly SQL injection on me I

1209
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,430
don't want to be simple if someone is

1210
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:38,990
gonna hack one of my apps I want to be

1211
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,250
like the most difficult thing they've

1212
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:44,120
ever done right and I feel I feel that's

1213
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,660
really important and especially like

1214
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,340
small businesses you don't need to be

1215
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:50,960
like you don't need to assume China's

1216
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,670
coming after you because they're very

1217
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:53,900
advanced they really know what they're

1218
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,120
doing right but you do need to make sure

1219
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,920
that like the kid next door who like

1220
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,420
it's just learning how to code or like

1221
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:01,910
watched a video at Def Con isn't going

1222
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:03,860
to be able to get into your app everyone

1223
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,230
should have that level of security eyes

1224
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:10,760
okay oh and so Microsoft posts all of

1225
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,640
our big incidents online we like to show

1226
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,230
our underwear this is the thing we do we

1227
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:18,290
call it dog food and we share the

1228
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:19,970
details of what happened to us to show

1229
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:21,410
we're not perfect so other people can

1230
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:22,640
learn from it and you can see we're

1231
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,440
working our butts off at it if you want

1232
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,570
to read about our incidents like all the

1233
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:30,500
big ones go there even when it's bad I

1234
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:34,220
yeah okay so conclusion thanks for

1235
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,420
sticking with me the whole time

1236
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,779
OPSEC is really hard I feel like

1237
00:50:39,779 --> 00:50:41,789
application security is the new frontier

1238
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:44,160
in security specifically because we're

1239
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,019
getting really good enterprise security

1240
00:50:46,019 --> 00:50:47,519
we're getting really good at Network and

1241
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:49,380
perimeter security and we still kind of

1242
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,900
stink app sack and I think that this is

1243
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,249
a topic that people really need to pay

1244
00:50:53,249 --> 00:50:56,190
attention to and if you prepare for a

1245
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:58,079
knapsack incident you will be so happy

1246
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,849
later because one will eventually happen

1247
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:01,019
to you because that is the thing right

1248
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:02,609
now that is what hackers are learning

1249
00:51:02,609 --> 00:51:05,249
how to do they're less about memorizing

1250
00:51:05,249 --> 00:51:07,890
things about operating systems and more

1251
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:10,019
about using burp suite looking at your

1252
00:51:10,019 --> 00:51:11,869
app and seeing what they can do to you

1253
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:14,039
and with that I'd like to give you a

1254
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:15,989
couple of resources so I was going to

1255
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,489
list like a million things about

1256
00:51:17,489 --> 00:51:19,380
Incident Response and then I just

1257
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,150
instead suggest you use your favorite

1258
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:25,349
search engine this is mine to look for

1259
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:27,660
incident response cheats right there's

1260
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,309
so many great ideas on the internet and

1261
00:51:29,309 --> 00:51:32,910
you should steal all of them and okay so

1262
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:34,559
if you are interested in learning about

1263
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,019
software security I have compiled so

1264
00:51:37,019 --> 00:51:39,329
this is a blog post I wrote and I update

1265
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:41,249
it regularly of different application

1266
00:51:41,249 --> 00:51:44,549
security resources that I used or I

1267
00:51:44,549 --> 00:51:47,519
wrote that are all free to learn about

1268
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:51,509
the security of software and I think

1269
00:51:51,509 --> 00:51:52,170
cameras are down

1270
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:56,459
and I would shamelessly like to ask you

1271
00:51:56,459 --> 00:51:58,079
to follow me because these are the

1272
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,819
topics I talk about all the time

1273
00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:01,999
I have a live show every Sunday on

1274
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:05,219
twitch and mixer save our show so

1275
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:07,559
YouTube I have a blog I'm a giant nerd

1276
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:10,079
this is all I do and if you want to know

1277
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,390
more about this I really want to teach

1278
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:14,759
you and with that

1279
00:52:14,759 --> 00:52:17,400
oh should I - oh I'll just go back to

1280
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,569
the I'll just leave it on this one and

1281
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:20,789
I'll just say thank you for your time

1282
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:23,420
and attention today

1283
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:37,530
