1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:14,480
[Music]

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,160
and basically the job is to give advice

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,189
guidance direction and cyber to 110 all

4
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,080
departments agencies right so we have a

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,699
pretty good taste of the different needs

6
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,710
out there from the high end to the low

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,570
end so part of what I want to talk about

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,490
today is well what is this whole digital

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,980
thing and given that I work for for alex

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,630
Binet who says digital every second word

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,250
out of his mouth I think have a pretty

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,230
decent idea of what it what it means and

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,059
I want to talk about what what our role

14
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,800
is as cyber practitioners is in this

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,090
whole digital transformation thing and

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,370
how we may have to tweak a bit of our

17
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,289
mindsets and then maybe since I am

18
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,610
government I figure I should talk a bit

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,350
about some of our priorities and

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,250
challenges in the government of

21
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,350
candidates so so to get started like

22
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,610
we'll just kind of talk quickly about

23
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,469
like what is digital transformation even

24
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,829
mean I'm not gonna spend the whole

25
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,210
presentation on this but I mean it's not

26
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,040
I just want to be clear that it's not

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,310
about putting paper forms online that's

28
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,439
digitization that's a lot different than

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,310
transforming your business model like

30
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,570
some of those companies that I'm sure

31
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,720
you're well aware of do they change more

32
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,100
than theirs their tech tits they're

33
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,049
people in the process and technology

34
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,460
that changed right so they they

35
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,470
fundamentally flipped their business

36
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,540
models which which is something that I

37
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,979
mean I know the government is trying to

38
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,840
do desperately probably 20 years too

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,340
late but we're we're getting there and

40
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,020
I'm sure some of the private sectors are

41
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,700
doing the same thing but like I said

42
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,229
it's about it's about the new approaches

43
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:37,049
and so so what that means is that we

44
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,520
have to take new approaches for cyber

45
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,990
security as well because a lot of things

46
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,500
that come with the word digital like

47
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,810
like agile and and and faster and

48
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,920
seamless and all these other words

49
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,880
you'll hear and I'll get to that in a

50
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,770
few minutes but from a government

51
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,729
perspective I'll tell you what that

52
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,829
means for us so my TV or heard my

53
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,450
minister speak he loves this frickin

54
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,009
quote but it's pretty good so I'll say

55
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,659
it again that we can't be a blockbuster

56
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,640
government when we're serving a Netflix

57
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,380
citizenry and what he means by that is

58
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,240
how you deal with government and think

59
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,380
about how you deal with all the things

60
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,579
in your private life like when you call

61
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,500
your car your burrow or whatever and you

62
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,550
book your oats everything comes to you

63
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,739
right except for government and and I

64
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:11,910
realize I'm government so I'm gonna put

65
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,370
that aside for a second and say

66
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,330
it's a pain in the ass to deal with

67
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,830
government sometimes when thinkable I

68
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,540
just went to my passport and I printed

69
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,150
out the form and I fill it out by hand I

70
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,010
have to walk - oh I'll take a freaking

71
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,720
card got no or whatever the case may be

72
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,280
and I mean I'm going to them like that's

73
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,720
the whole blockbuster model right and

74
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,040
and what we're trying to do and we were

75
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,030
talking about it for a while and I

76
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,560
realized it's it's a lot of talk but

77
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,209
it's getting there he's trying to flip

78
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:33,890
that around - right turn in to make

79
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,750
government turn into something like

80
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,970
these things are and the vision you'll

81
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,310
hear you know are people talk about is

82
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,950
any any service any platform any device

83
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,829
any partner and what that means like in

84
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,870
theory not tomorrow but are cool things

85
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,239
like maybe you book let me go to Expedia

86
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,129
and you book a trip and Expedia says oh

87
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:53,660
crap your passports about to expire

88
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,849
while you're on the trip I'm gonna send

89
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,530
a query off to immigration they're gonna

90
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,359
tell you you get a notification your

91
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:02,120
phone you like more come to you versus

92
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,650
you come to them that type of attitude

93
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,750
imagine food recalls being displayed on

94
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,819
your fridge for example like that type

95
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,290
of stuff sounds super cool don't get me

96
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,430
wrong I know we're not quite there yet

97
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,500
but that's the type of attitude we are

98
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,640
trying to have when it comes to

99
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,579
digitally transforming government and

100
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,709
ironically you know in the late 90s we

101
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:22,190
put taxes online or CRA open up their

102
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,410
interfaces to people like turbo tax and

103
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,989
and held the weather network is open up

104
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:29,629
its data to to re the Environment

105
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:30,650
Canada's open up it state of the weather

106
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,690
network and we started this kind of

107
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,370
government as a platform movement like

108
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,620
20 years ago we just kind of plateaued

109
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,109
so a lot of the talk right now is to

110
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:41,180
kind of restart some of that now I think

111
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,949
that sounds like as a citizen like

112
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:44,540
obviously super cool that's how I want

113
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,180
to deal with government as a security

114
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,639
guy I'm realizing you know that's that's

115
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,260
just puts even more emphasis on the

116
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,690
security of the underlying ecosystem

117
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,430
obviously it's all built on trust

118
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,519
and and you know if you if you have kids

119
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:00,739
Trust takes forever to build and one

120
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:03,079
second the break and in digital it's

121
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:05,900
gonna be it's gonna be our backbone

122
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,459
there so we have to make sure that we're

123
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:09,590
we're on top of this stuff now like I

124
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,239
said with digital you hear all these

125
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,160
words like nimble and agile and things

126
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,039
moving faster and and and you know

127
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:18,470
traditionally and I'm not gonna I'm

128
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,668
gonna pick on people in the room but

129
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:21,858
generally I'm gonna say cybersecurity

130
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:23,750
hasn't exactly been known for being the

131
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,050
most agile of people I would say

132
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,539
so so part of this is changing the

133
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:31,759
perception or the attitude around wow we

134
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,800
do cyber and and I I've been using

135
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,630
digital transformation as kind of the

136
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,280
you know the kickstart for this like

137
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,500
there I t's talking about and services

138
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,610
are talking about changing how they go

139
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,050
like why not take this opportunity to

140
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,580
change a little bit of the perception

141
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,919
around around cyber security because

142
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,039
traditionally it's kind of kind of

143
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,550
reputation like that right so it's it's

144
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,190
a little bit of you know a lot of risk

145
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,410
aversion no question you know

146
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,030
historically if there's been a checkbox

147
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,190
for security I'd say security people

148
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,930
want to check it because it's all cool

149
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,460
I'm more secure the better right but

150
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,440
what ends up happening when you check

151
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,909
all your check boxes all the time

152
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:10,030
without any kind of contacts is that

153
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,319
well you're kind of overdoing secure you

154
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,580
don't make it security usable if it's

155
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,949
not usable I'm gonna argue it's probably

156
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,960
not good enough and and I'll use I use

157
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,599
an example from a walk not a lot of name

158
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:22,340
departments anymore so there was a

159
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,110
department that did an iPhone pilot so

160
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,810
the imagine an iPhone sounds pretty cool

161
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,280
right we still use BlackBerry's ago in

162
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,199
my pocket right now no disrespect to

163
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,199
blackberry but he had your time iPhone

164
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,240
iPhone came out they want they want to

165
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,800
pilot this in the department so what

166
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,229
good idea give the security people guess

167
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:43,729
what happens so everything every nets

168
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:44,180
checked

169
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,590
check check check check my time you're

170
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,880
done with it you have no camera no App

171
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,190
Store no anything and basically have a

172
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,449
glory have a thousand dollar flip phone

173
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:52,580
honestly is what you have so so cool

174
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,550
security you did your job business gets

175
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,740
it and it's useless right so that's the

176
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,030
kind of thing we have to we have to

177
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,460
change a bit so so part of I you know

178
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,690
that's the kind of stuff that gives us a

179
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,300
bit of a bad reputation about trying to

180
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,199
pick on people here but this is a

181
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,599
generalization there's a famous quote

182
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:10,759
that I love from the cyber center in the

183
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,830
UK and they said a highly secure

184
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,539
solution that no-one uses is not secure

185
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:16,940
at all and so I fully agree with that

186
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,110
like I think that's one of the best

187
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,130
things to think about when you when you

188
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,630
keep this in mind is that you build

189
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,969
something so crazy secure that you just

190
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:24,020
can't use it well they're just gonna

191
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,419
find a way around it and and that's what

192
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,130
that's what typically happens with us

193
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,680
right and this is what I call uninformed

194
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,330
security so sure you think and you know

195
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,949
what I always say like I think a false

196
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:35,240
sense security is probably worse than

197
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,500
having no security because you got no

198
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,969
security you're probably paranoid just

199
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:39,770
tell people a false sense security you

200
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,880
kind of just have you know

201
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,930
head-in-the-sand thinking yeah

202
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,000
everything's a-okay meanwhile this is

203
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,680
what's happening right so the end of the

204
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,570
day like users for the most part you

205
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,030
just want to do their damn jobs you know

206
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,440
they get to work and they just want to

207
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,580
like anyone else they want to do their

208
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,530
job and and if you're seen as the

209
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,870
barrier for or the inefficiency between

210
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,610
them getting their jobs done I'm gonna

211
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,230
find a way around you and you know

212
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,430
another example like I'll talk about

213
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,920
myself and I know no departments this

214
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,170
guy I know what a department was trying

215
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,670
to get to Google Docs one day at his

216
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,380
Department good guy good looking dude

217
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,960
really smart he was trying to

218
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,290
collaborate with a partner in the UK

219
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,990
right so Google Docs unclassified stuff

220
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,940
but he goes to his computer and it's

221
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,190
blocked so okay that's cool so what do

222
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,060
you think he does he's got to get his

223
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,620
job done and his Security's not going to

224
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,420
open it and he happens to run security

225
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,940
for the Government of Canada and he said

226
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,650
okay fine so I'm gonna email the thing

227
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,060
to my personal food he emailed this

228
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,250
thing to his personal phone you know

229
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,080
went up uploaded to Google dogs didn't

230
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,240
anyway and so bypassed all the measures

231
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,490
anyway so what I'm trying to say is the

232
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,400
behavior we encourage by making all

233
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,780
these things unusable is we're

234
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,460
encouraging people to find workarounds I

235
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,060
did it myself

236
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,770
let's be honest like I did it myself and

237
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,390
I told the guy afterwards this is what I

238
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,590
did this why I did it because I had to

239
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,150
get a job done there's a document we had

240
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,320
to make changes it was due at a certain

241
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,630
time sorry like that I'd make you know

242
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,090
make do what you got right so and and I

243
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,560
mean I know that's a low risk example

244
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,760
but I'm using that because that's

245
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,950
exactly what happens in our world with

246
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,390
all our users there for the most part

247
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,650
just trying to get there I get their

248
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,110
jobs done and so you got to wonder like

249
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,960
why people see security as as a barrier

250
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,510
you know so I always you know it's kind

251
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,010
of an us versus them thing and it kind

252
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,390
of feels like they hate us and we kind

253
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,220
of disrespect them a bit and that's kind

254
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,840
of what I want to want to you know the

255
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,750
try to advocate some change for so the

256
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,480
other thing that people kind of hate us

257
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,610
for is that like I said to them it's a

258
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,870
lot of finger-pointing a like our

259
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,719
industry I find it's a lot of you got to

260
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,250
do this you know I'm we're smarter than

261
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,479
you are I'll echo the risks and then

262
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:36,950
fear uncertainty and doubt and blah blah

263
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,860
blah and scare scare scare and and you

264
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,719
know there's some month some people do

265
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:43,070
that and hasn't worked out so well for

266
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,530
them I guess but I mean I think you know

267
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,030
it's really funny I security awareness

268
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,060
month is last month and and a big theme

269
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,839
is you know security is everyone's

270
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:52,520
responsibility yeah everyone here that

271
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,050
big big theme Security's everyone's

272
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,680
friendly

273
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,149
then on the other hand we hear well

274
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:58,519
users of the weakest link so on the one

275
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,019
hand you're saying that's everyone's

276
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:01,100
problem we're all working together on

277
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,850
the other hand you're pointing your

278
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,470
finger saying user the weakest link

279
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,079
so it feels a little hypocritical that

280
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,610
we just keep picking on our users you

281
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,699
know and so it's weeks I don't think I'm

282
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:12,439
not sure any other industry does that

283
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:15,290
like I think of things like like fishing

284
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,069
too and don't get me wrong

285
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:17,179
I'm not gonna disparate like I think

286
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:18,170
fishing tests are a good thing for

287
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,850
awareness and that but just it's it's

288
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,350
the way it's our attitude when we

289
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,119
conduct them it's the haha got you

290
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:25,839
clicked on a link sucker like haha and

291
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,579
you know like it's it's this it's this

292
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:30,829
constant wanting to demean them I guess

293
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:32,449
is something that we have to do instead

294
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:34,249
of kind of educating and and passwords

295
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:35,899
and other thing like we of core I've

296
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,369
seen a hundred times people putting

297
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,899
passwords on stick you know it's not

298
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:40,490
like hi you know you you're a loser you

299
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,689
shouldn't do passwords and sticky notes

300
00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:44,389
you're stupid but then but think of it

301
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:45,649
from the other side right think of it

302
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:49,279
from our own policy says you know in

303
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,959
general and most part I'm sure you're

304
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,639
all the same you got to change your path

305
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,540
you have a different password for

306
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,279
everything to use your password has to

307
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,050
be I don't know eight twelve characters

308
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,999
something like that your passport your

309
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,309
password has to expire every 30 60 90

310
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,949
days has to have special characters or

311
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:05,449
sometimes can't contain special

312
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:07,550
characters you don't know like I so put

313
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,870
yourself in the user shoes for a second

314
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,790
like those rules are absolutely insane

315
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,379
if you think about it just just common

316
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:13,879
sensical II you know like imagine going

317
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,160
to the Rideau Center out here every time

318
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,300
you go into a different store you got to

319
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,529
like a different like gesture you know

320
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:20,439
like yeah wink wink to get in there

321
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:22,399
called Monaco or whatever and you do

322
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,929
some kind of baseball arm gesture to get

323
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:25,040
into a different one and you got to

324
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,949
change that gesture every month to go

325
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:28,999
into a new store like it just doesn't

326
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:31,249
make sense in any other world right so

327
00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:33,410
this is one of the more reasons why

328
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,149
people hate us but it's it's our own

329
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:36,949
doing so I I kind of say every time I

330
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:38,449
hear user the weakest link I kind of

331
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:40,339
turn it back on us and say maybe maybe

332
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,740
we are like maybe maybe our job is to

333
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,019
make them have a safer space to play it

334
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,870
and so link clicking which which listen

335
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,790
I I get I get the dangers of it and all

336
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,049
but and I know there's tech out there to

337
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:52,639
fix it but I think our job should be to

338
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,189
focus on making link clicking safe like

339
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:57,410
to me we've done our job when I don't

340
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,970
give a rat's what link they click on

341
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,860
when it can be isolated in sandbox and

342
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,259
and not worry about like a one-state

343
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:04,309
where we're worried about people

344
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:05,360
clicking links maybe that's what does

345
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,370
that say for the the posture of our our

346
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:07,850
network

347
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,649
I mean so that's the kind of stuff I

348
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:11,779
want to say like I'd I'd like to be an

349
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:13,550
environment one day where we're all that

350
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,720
stuff is safe for the user and that's

351
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,730
you know I'm not an Apple fanboy that's

352
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,110
what Apple does well right you can give

353
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,180
an iPad to a three-year-old and you

354
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,680
figure out how to use it and they have

355
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,690
to worry about all the rules behind it

356
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,069
it's just usable and that's what I want

357
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:27,740
security to be more usable more

358
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,829
pragmatic um so so I look at other

359
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:32,449
industries all the time and and I I I

360
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:33,350
love the table-saw

361
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,420
example I heard this one so I'm just I'm

362
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,730
addicted to it so so a table saw comes

363
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,019
out I don't know how early nineteen

364
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:40,220
hundred's whenever comes out it's it's

365
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,889
it's a blade that spins on a flat

366
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:43,339
surface

367
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:45,319
right any hope people are using cut wood

368
00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:46,850
it's freaking awesome and I'm sure

369
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,050
people are cutting her thumbs off left

370
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,569
and right and I'm sure so the industry

371
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:53,509
probably goes back you know think oh man

372
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:54,680
yeah we got a you big user problem

373
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,120
people cutting her thumbs off and and I

374
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,160
can just imagine just imagine like if a

375
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,269
cyber guy was there they'll be like ah

376
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:01,040
you know users the weakest link you

377
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,329
better training and awareness we better

378
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:04,550
uh we we better put fake blades and

379
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,959
catch him you know catching his thumb

380
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,670
off or something and hopefully someone

381
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,350
smarter says you know what maybe we

382
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,790
gotta make it more user friendly or

383
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,350
maybe we gotta put a guard on it for

384
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,639
example so that's what they do right

385
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,680
they evolved to a guard and and I'm sure

386
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,329
that I'm sure the finger cutting got

387
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,459
reduced a little bit and now this does

388
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:21,170
freaking table saw is that detect the

389
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,339
moisture on your finger and stop

390
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:23,750
spinning as soon as your finger touches

391
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,810
it and so and and I know I know it's

392
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,029
it's not the same analogy but as cyber

393
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:30,529
but the principles are the same like

394
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:32,329
they they kept iterating until they got

395
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:34,009
to a place where they made it as safe as

396
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:35,870
the humanly could for for their users

397
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,790
and I use the analogy because safety and

398
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,079
security are the closest things like I'm

399
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:40,160
fine but there's a whole bunch of these

400
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,500
and every other everything like I just

401
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,269
find that our community seems to be a

402
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:47,930
bit naive in thinking that we can fix

403
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,069
everything with user training and

404
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,259
awareness and that we will fix you know

405
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:52,939
the users and they're the weakest but

406
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,079
the weakest link every where quite

407
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,310
frankly I don't want to say the week is

408
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,689
synced I just we're human humans make

409
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:57,139
mistakes

410
00:12:57,139 --> 00:12:59,959
cars are adapting to to us being human

411
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,759
cars are getting from the 1900s to now

412
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,649
look at the evolution in cars so I want

413
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,329
us to get to that same way and making it

414
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:07,430
safer and safer and safer for users to

415
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,029
be users of humans to be to be humans so

416
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,769
it starts with just a bit more of an

417
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:14,120
enablement attitude I know you've heard

418
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,500
this for years Security's got to be an

419
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,319
enabler I just I'm not sure we put it

420
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:20,540
into practice as best as we could so but

421
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,190
but like I said

422
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,810
with this whole digital transformation

423
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,430
change and stuff this is like the chance

424
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,209
to re brand reinvent ourselves and I

425
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:29,740
think that like one of the things I

426
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,480
started like when I met with with Alex

427
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,980
when he first started I swear to God the

428
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,940
first thing he said to me he's like I

429
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,410
hate security people all they ever tell

430
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,389
abuse no like oh man this is gonna be

431
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:39,160
awesome working this guy is gonna be a

432
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,250
treat and that's another story but but

433
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,199
truthfully I told them I got I it's not

434
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,490
my job to say no I'm never gonna say no

435
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,009
I will say yes but and yes and and yes

436
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:49,480
here's how and yes and here's some tips

437
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,759
and or whatever but but it's it's not

438
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,319
our job to say no our job is to just

439
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:55,930
identify risk and say here are some some

440
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,060
some some good risk to take and bad risk

441
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,430
to take like I think of a guy who just

442
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,350
got my car down at a mechanic and you

443
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,300
think of your favorite mechanic is the

444
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,560
mechanic that comes back with it with a

445
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,029
giant checklist and said you got to do

446
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:08,889
all these things before you leave here

447
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,500
or is the mechanic that goes hey you

448
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,629
know what this is you must do this stuff

449
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:15,579
cuz you you know it's your brakes or

450
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:16,839
whatever here's you can get away with

451
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,189
this and maybe come back next year for

452
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:20,019
this stuff and I'm pretty sure you're

453
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:21,399
gonna pick that second one and the

454
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,720
reason and that's what their lives on

455
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,519
the line by the way our lives our wives

456
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:27,220
our spouses lives our kids lives are on

457
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,899
the line with our car and we're making

458
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:31,120
risk-based decisions with that tell me

459
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,009
we can't do the same thing with

460
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:34,870
cybersecurity right so that's kind of

461
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,009
the attitude I think we need to have is

462
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:39,490
be that be the helpful mechanic and the

463
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,380
other challenge with us is and believe

464
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,089
me I know this well and in government is

465
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:45,279
that one size doesn't fit all and and

466
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,019
and like look like some of our

467
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,639
departments go from the Department of

468
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,519
National Defense to like polar knowledge

469
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,290
Canada and no disrespect to polar

470
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,540
knowledge Canada who are all for them

471
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,610
probably great people but but they have

472
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,380
a vastly different security posture than

473
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,730
Department of National Defence right so

474
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,130
what I mean is that you you can't you

475
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,779
cannot have there's this checklist based

476
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,920
approach I certainly didn't get into

477
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,809
security to walk around with a checklist

478
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:09,430
and make sure people follow it I wanted

479
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,470
to have intelligent risk management

480
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,360
conversations and actually have like you

481
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,579
know debates and talk about business

482
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:16,779
context and figure out what's the right

483
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:18,790
size right like you got a safe at home

484
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,309
it's this big I'm not putting and I love

485
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:23,319
my McDonald's coupons the two condign is

486
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:24,550
awesome but I'm not putting mine

487
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,019
McDonald's coupons in my safe I have a

488
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:27,790
limit amount of space that's reserved

489
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,309
for my my valuables my heirlooms my

490
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:31,750
whatever Ryan Morris my wife's jewelry

491
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,190
but let's be honest but

492
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,210
the end of the day you have a loon

493
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,620
amount of space you gotta prioritize and

494
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,210
that's what we have to do better with

495
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,500
security we have a tendency especially

496
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,570
in government over classify which means

497
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,880
over protect which means overspend and a

498
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,880
lot of other things so so we just we

499
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,770
just have to get better at at the risk

500
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,200
management part because at the end of

501
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,220
day like there's no such thing as

502
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,260
perfect like I don't care how hard you

503
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,940
try you're not gonna prevent everything

504
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,040
and you've all seen the spectrum to

505
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,540
prevent the tech respond recover there's

506
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,150
a reason it's not just called prevent

507
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,070
because there there is more to it and so

508
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,200
sometimes I feel and that Google Docs

509
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,510
examples one of them we spend so much

510
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,640
time trying to prevent and I think

511
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,960
that's that's probably - to our

512
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,220
detriment think of the Google Docs

513
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,780
example again that I gave earlier and

514
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,960
that like you have so here I am

515
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,940
bypassing my own network because I need

516
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,690
to get my job done

517
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,880
I would think of at the under side so

518
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,310
all that traffic even it was malicious

519
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,020
you're not seeing so I'd rather that at

520
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,670
least be done on my network and maybe I

521
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,080
can't prevent it least I could detect

522
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,630
when maybe I'm uploading 300 gigs on a

523
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,250
Sunday night at 3:00 in the morning so

524
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,200
so you shift your posture from trying to

525
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,700
block everything to trying to figure out

526
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,680
you know some stuff is detectable or not

527
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,450
and that's to me one of them where I'd

528
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,860
rather that I don't know you I'd rather

529
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,360
that activity happen on a network that

530
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,280
I'm monitoring versus knowing in my head

531
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,470
that it's happening on the side via

532
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,730
phones I mean we all have these little

533
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,440
things in our pockets that can do a lot

534
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,420
more than that our networks are allowing

535
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,720
us to do so so anyway so I mean like

536
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,250
like I said it's about taking taking

537
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,540
risk you all took a risk getting here

538
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,180
today I'm sure you cross the street

539
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,609
somewhere to get here or something you

540
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:07,369
probably looked both ways moving on this

541
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:08,630
cat right here with the lemonade I don't

542
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,609
know but he looks a little dangerous I'm

543
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:13,790
not sure but well we'll see I mean at

544
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,560
the end the day like you you you wait

545
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,290
for the light to go you cross the street

546
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,459
when you can you look both ways and you

547
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:20,359
take your headphones out

548
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,939
cybers got to be the same way you got to

549
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:24,500
make sure that you're you're just not

550
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,849
you're not overdoing it at the end of

551
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:28,580
the day like so I just find like I think

552
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,190
sometimes we we don't have those

553
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,290
conversations as best we can and and I

554
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,940
think that's what we just have to admit

555
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,500
like we're gonna get breached let's just

556
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,210
beyond nots I'm saying just submit and

557
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,950
except for getting a breach do what you

558
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,780
got to do and then plan and react

559
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,790
accordingly I mean with the whole

560
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,190
spectrum again so part of this I mean

561
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,929
the how I mean I realize that

562
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:49,759
spent the last like 20 minutes crapping

563
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:51,440
all over security people and and that's

564
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,879
not mine my intention is more just to

565
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:54,710
give you the user the user side of

566
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,499
things and and and the idea is to engage

567
00:17:57,499 --> 00:17:58,970
early we hear this all the time I'm not

568
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,379
the first guy to say engage early have

569
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,299
conversations early whatever this is all

570
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:05,389
you know 20 years ago what I'm saying is

571
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:07,070
different though is that you wonder why

572
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,450
they don't engage us early like it's

573
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,240
some of the attitudes I said earlier is

574
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,960
I think part of the problem so so yes I

575
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,119
know historically what what business

576
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,590
lines do they don't engage you at all

577
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,179
they come to you at the very end they

578
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:21,769
ask you for a sign-off they got a gun to

579
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:23,509
your head and then of course like my

580
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:25,340
first reaction be like whoa whoa like

581
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,200
have you done all this and it's a

582
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,389
natural human reaction and obviously

583
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:31,220
understandably if you were engaged from

584
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,200
the get-go that would be a whole

585
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,519
different story I know that's been our

586
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,799
mantra for four years but like I said

587
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,149
with the attitudes that I mentioned

588
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:39,529
previously you can you can kind of

589
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:41,059
sympathize with the business lines when

590
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:42,590
they don't want to engage you early when

591
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,019
all they see you as as a red tape

592
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:47,690
exercise and that or a barrier and

593
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,980
that's kind of the mentality we're

594
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,869
trying to change I I want them to see us

595
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:54,559
as value-add and so you know III kind of

596
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,480
even blobbing a lot about user you know

597
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,460
making it business focused or user

598
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,710
centric or whatever but the truth that

599
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,759
matter is I've been talking with this in

600
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,929
government for for about a year and a

601
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:05,299
half and and I and I swear to God like I

602
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:06,799
am now getting calls

603
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,019
I almost too early to be honestly I want

604
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:11,149
to say that you know but truthfully

605
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,559
people are calling me now about systems

606
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,179
that are like a year and a half away and

607
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:16,039
I'm like this would never happen a

608
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,809
couple years ago and I think a lot of it

609
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:19,100
is just the change in attitude about

610
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,600
okay no we're here to help like just

611
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,249
tell me what you want to do and I said a

612
00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:23,899
year and a half earlier well I have a

613
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:25,129
lot of other things to do to be honest

614
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:26,240
but I mean I'm happy to have those

615
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,490
conversations because I would much

616
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,440
rather the year and half early than the

617
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,789
day before it's going live right I'm

618
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:33,919
sure everyone else is in the same boat

619
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,659
so so like I said I think it's just

620
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:37,909
about you know sending sending the user

621
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:40,850
centric message a bit of pragmatism goes

622
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,840
a long way and you know like I said

623
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,639
there's no better time than now to do it

624
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:49,879
so so that's kind of mine that's my my

625
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:51,649
soapbox part I will talk a bit about

626
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:52,850
what we're doing in the government of

627
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,929
Canon now to help enable this kind of

628
00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:00,019
this attitude so so cloud cloud is one

629
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:01,850
of our top

630
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,380
priorities I would say if not the top

631
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,700
priority for to enable digital

632
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,410
transformation for for a lot of the

633
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,690
reasons I just said earlier I mean quite

634
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,660
frankly it's be honest we can't spend

635
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,100
the amount of money on security that the

636
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,780
cloud providers can the hyper skid was

637
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,510
specifically I mean you can't you can

638
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,679
argue without if you want but I mean

639
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:20,059
you're not gonna get any better than

640
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:22,100
they're doing so and the other thing is

641
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,750
you know having the power of energy

642
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,280
certifications and stuff behind you you

643
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,960
think about some of our processes of

644
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,490
accreditation before you know before

645
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,350
going live and you look at the cloud

646
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,520
providers they're checking half the

647
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,410
boxes out of the box I mean that's

648
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,909
that's half the stuff you have to do

649
00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:37,909
anymore on Prem and and that to me in a

650
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:39,740
world where we're scarce with talent

651
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,350
already is is kind of a no-brainer so in

652
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,850
the Government of Canada now I'll be

653
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,289
honest our cloud adoption is a little

654
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:48,020
bit slow but but I mean we put all the

655
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,250
tools out there to deal we have a cloud

656
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,230
first policy now where I'm not saying

657
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,580
every single damn thing goes in the

658
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,110
cloud like national secrets are gonna

659
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,210
stay on Prem I'll tell you that much

660
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,950
but for the mutts say 80% of our stuff

661
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,419
there's no reason it cannot be hosted in

662
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:00,799
the cloud at least in Canada for God's

663
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,510
sakes right so it's a cloud first policy

664
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,280
you have to look cloud first you better

665
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,740
damn well rationalize why you can't go

666
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,970
in there and there are very few

667
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,669
exceptions to that right now we have a

668
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,500
baseline security control profile that

669
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,240
we put out there and mapped against

670
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,190
industry standards so you have a FedRAMP

671
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,710
and you have a sock - well you just

672
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,120
checked a few of those boxes and now the

673
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,330
job of the security practitioner on prem

674
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,909
is is now down to here and and let's be

675
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,230
honest we don't have that on prem today

676
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,179
right you sure you have your little

677
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:30,500
audits and stuff that we do we don't

678
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,960
have the assurances of a third party at

679
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,370
Deloitte and Ernst & Young coming in and

680
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,659
auditing us every once in a while that

681
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:37,340
is one of the luxuries that the cloud

682
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,320
providers have as well okay and I'm not

683
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,140
saying that I'm not saying that the you

684
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,520
know the clouds the be-all-end-all I'm

685
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,780
just saying that it's one of the tools

686
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,460
in our toolbox that we have to start

687
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,470
using if we're gonna get a bit smarter

688
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,960
about this so we you know we have a

689
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,159
couple other things that I'm happy to

690
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,450
talk to you about we have a lot a lot of

691
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,820
documentation online now I'll be honest

692
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,230
like our biggest problem is procurement

693
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,230
and you know sometimes it's not the

694
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,870
easiest thing to do in government but we

695
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,400
have unclassified cloud that we can buy

696
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,530
now and knock on wood without giving any

697
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,880
dates cuz we're not good at holding

698
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,770
dates but by in the fiscal year we

699
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,880
should have some mechanism to by

700
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,620
protecta be cloud which which to me is

701
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,760
going to be the big game changer for

702
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,190
government I mean that's where your

703
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,050
Graz and your estc is gonna be able to

704
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,430
kind of put some of that sensitive stuff

705
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,650
out there and and protect it I I would

706
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,610
argue a little bit better than it might

707
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,250
be protected today you know some of the

708
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,540
clouds stuff I call them I call them

709
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,370
server huggers sometimes the server

710
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,040
huggers are a bit kind of worried about

711
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,390
the cloud and I'm thinking like you know

712
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,820
yeah if I have to hear the word Patriot

713
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,350
Act or something one more time I'm gonna

714
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,390
lose my mind because yeah there are

715
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,710
risks don't get me wrong there are risks

716
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,700
in the cloud and there are ways to

717
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,720
mitigate some of the risks but you

718
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,200
telling me there's no risk in on-prem

719
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,930
when a server running Windows 2003 is

720
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,610
sitting in a closet somewhere like I

721
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,280
mean to me this is about relative risk

722
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,050
and I and I'm about making sure our

723
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,480
relative risk is reduced as we as we

724
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,130
move forward is it perfect no is it

725
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,080
better than today pretty sure it is in

726
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,980
most cases next one we are working on a

727
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,560
lot of his digital identity so you know

728
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,840
all those cool dreams of Expedia and

729
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,300
fridge stuff that I talked about earlier

730
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,820
kind of hinges on a digital identity for

731
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,030
that to work the whole passport example

732
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:18,220
hinges on that whole thing so we we are

733
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,380
actively working with that like we you

734
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,670
might hear a lot to talk about Estonia

735
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,640
Estonia is super cool you know you go

736
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,660
there you have a card lets you do

737
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,460
everything with also a little bit of a

738
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,100
different culture I'm not sure we're

739
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,720
gonna know I'm not trying I guarantee

740
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,280
you're not gonna issue every Canadian a

741
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,780
national identity card and track them

742
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,250
with a single number pretty sure our

743
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,320
culture doesn't just really love that

744
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,910
too much but we are I'll tell you what

745
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,140
our vision is is to be more of a

746
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,560
federated approach where where you have

747
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,000
identities rooted like so here the way

748
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,410
it works in Canada is either born here

749
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,000
you move here if you're born here that

750
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,770
information lives with your province if

751
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,600
you move here that that was their

752
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,070
emigration those could be your trusted

753
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,600
sources you could you have your choice

754
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,190
of trust digital identity you can use to

755
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,320
consume your government services so no

756
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,780
single no single source of failure no

757
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,550
single source to compromise your choice

758
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,320
you don't to use it don't use it call

759
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,510
home phone if you want to so that's kind

760
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,920
of what we're working on we actually

761
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,360
have some pilots underway right now with

762
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,360
provinces one of them is in a kind of a

763
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,890
spoiler because it Sammy announced later

764
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,710
this month but keep between us the

765
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,320
province of Alberta has a digital ID so

766
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,940
if we're in Elberton maybe a friend

767
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,010
there try this you digital ID from

768
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,420
problem-solver did you get vetted in

769
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,400
person it's it's a credit it's verified

770
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,140
we're gonna try accepting that

771
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,610
to consume government services so in

772
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:34,600
theory Albertan can just login to estc

773
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,520
and do their student loans or then get

774
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,049
to taxes or whatever the case may be and

775
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:41,170
so that works and it should you can

776
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,760
imagine that kind of scaling out and you

777
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,470
think about you think of a government

778
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,450
like I I always use my mom as an example

779
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,530
like she doesn't know the difference

780
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,929
between getting her driver's license

781
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:52,720
done or taxes or social benefits or

782
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,120
whatever it's all government to her it's

783
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,160
only us that she draws the stupid line

784
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,260
between federal provincial and CRA estc

785
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,540
and whatever right I mean the citizens

786
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,190
don't care it's government stuff so why

787
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,380
can't you have a government ID that lets

788
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,700
you do your government stuff and that's

789
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,110
kind of what we're trying to work

790
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,870
towards why that works the alberta

791
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,669
example why that can work and how that

792
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:14,260
can scale is because we have something

793
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,940
called the pan Canyon Trust framework if

794
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,040
you haven't heard about it it's just in

795
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,750
a simplest terms it's a set of rules or

796
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,610
criteria that we all kind of agree to

797
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,540
abide by that

798
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,610
you know this level of effort is needed

799
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,440
to get to a trusted digital identity

800
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,179
whether it's an in-person check or some

801
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:29,830
of the other check boxes you got to meet

802
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,320
so if albert has met that and we are

803
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,669
good with that process and there's of

804
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:35,200
course an accreditation process to go

805
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,150
through why on earth can't we accept

806
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,890
that as a trust idea why can't that be

807
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,919
used in Ontario or BC or vice-versa so

808
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,600
so that's kind of the vision we're going

809
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,120
you'll see some more work on that it's

810
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,250
definitely a hot topic these days but

811
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,929
but more to come I guess stay tuned for

812
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:51,040
that pilot announcement you didn't hear

813
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,919
it from me

814
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,120
pragmatic security is something I kind

815
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,890
of ramble on about a lot I kind of did

816
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,080
it earlier to be honest but but here's

817
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,580
how we're kind of trying to do it so so

818
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,309
I Google Docs example it's supposed to

819
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:04,929
be no more because we put a direction to

820
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:08,049
say block stuff that's illegal block the

821
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:09,669
stuff that's absolutely inappropriate

822
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:12,030
for work and open everything else up and

823
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,080
I'll be honest it hasn't been super

824
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,600
well-received but it's baby steps some

825
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,400
departments have have loved it and done

826
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,110
well with it others are still working on

827
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,460
it I get that there are different risk

828
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,260
postures and I get that some can't open

829
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,760
that stuff because of a higher risk of

830
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,549
data loss and that's fine so you put in

831
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:32,700
some DLP or whatever you have to make do

832
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,020
but I'm just showing that the attitude

833
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,429
for security is starting to change is

834
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,370
where it's open open these sites and

835
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,050
rationalize the blocking instead of

836
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,580
blocking the sites and rationalizing

837
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,840
opening so it just starts it's a

838
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,840
different kind of conversation to have

839
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,590
password guidance I mentioned the

840
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,570
archaic password rules that we all

841
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:52,720
follow even the guy from NIST the guy

842
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,460
who wrote the rules in the first place

843
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,289
says password complexity is one of his

844
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:57,519
biggest regrets he think it's the

845
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:59,169
dumbest thing the behavior we've

846
00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:01,720
encouraged is probably something akin to

847
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,909
oh crap I gotta change every month well

848
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:05,350
I'm just gonna do my capital letter a

849
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,549
bunch of lowercase letters an

850
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:08,140
exclamation mark I'm gonna change a

851
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,600
special character every 60 days and so

852
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,399
if that's the if that's the culture

853
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:14,470
you've just put in the play like what

854
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,000
better off are you like that's not

855
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,889
really user friendly and in fact I think

856
00:27:17,889 --> 00:27:19,240
we're just creating barriers for the

857
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,740
sake of creating them so the new

858
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,230
guidance that we just published and we

859
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,230
are going to maybe make a new standard

860
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:29,049
we'll see how this is received is a lot

861
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:30,970
more simple it's it's it's a certain

862
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,010
character length I want to say twelve I

863
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,909
don't have the number off the top of my

864
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:35,200
head I'm looking at that guy twelve yeah

865
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,350
twelve twelve ish characters all

866
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,409
lowercase no complexity no expiry and so

867
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:44,710
the theory with that is that okay you

868
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,539
twelve the math works if you go to

869
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,889
brute-force so you do the math it's it's

870
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:50,320
pretty strong the no expiry is because

871
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,299
if he's no indication of a breach and no

872
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:53,710
breach 'ln well I changed it like why

873
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,659
encourage this repetitive add a

874
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:57,309
different special character increment

875
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:58,659
and number it in your password behavior

876
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:01,240
and then notify upon breaches and change

877
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,490
then so that's kind of the new again use

878
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,779
your friendly stuff and this is the kind

879
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:07,090
of stuff that I'll be honest it buys the

880
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,620
street cred with the users you start

881
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,730
making their lives a little bit easier

882
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,860
but not compromising security like you

883
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,269
telling me like I told you about the the

884
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:14,740
brute force stuff if the maths the same

885
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,240
four twelve lowercase characters as it

886
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,730
is for eight with complexity tell me why

887
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,620
that's not a better thing to do

888
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,120
especially we're gonna reduce frequency

889
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,500
of change and doing me wrong I mean

890
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,610
password managers and all these other

891
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,870
things are good ideas as well but these

892
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,789
types of things to enable our users

893
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,380
rather than sitting back and giving them

894
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,480
some dumb policy that says these rules

895
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,950
that just like I said when you look at

896
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,750
it from a common sense perspective are

897
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,940
very tough to follow I think change is a

898
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,880
bit of our street cred as well

899
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,679
I mentioned the HTTPS Everywhere here

900
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,149
because a bit of a plug for an

901
00:28:43,149 --> 00:28:45,010
initiative that we launched in that we

902
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,960
want all our sites to be HTTPS public

903
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,330
facing no matter what since there were

904
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,340
not but I want to point out to the way

905
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,990
we did it and it's even when we give

906
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,279
direction in departments now it's the

907
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:56,020
first I've done this instead of just

908
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,310
being typical treasure board and writing

909
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,420
a nice little directive and putting her

910
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,740
feet up which it's not what we do but

911
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,380
that's what people think we do we we

912
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,090
wrote a direction and then we made it

913
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,070
user friendly we actually published a

914
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,080
dashboard for them that automatically

915
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,520
scans all domains every night and

916
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,410
publishes the results and says here's

917
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,940
how many of your departments are HTTP

918
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,770
compliant so we're even making security

919
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,290
easy for the implementers so all of this

920
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:20,140
is about like making stuff easy making

921
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,520
it user-friendly so they can focus on

922
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,500
the stuff they have to focus on for the

923
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,090
record I do want to publish that

924
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,100
dashboard publicly and I'm having a

925
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,630
little bit of trouble with that but I

926
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,010
will assure you it could be published

927
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,600
publicly because I think it's kind of

928
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,520
stupid to hide this stuff plan you can

929
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,380
just go to Google Chrome today and see

930
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,640
the words not secure when you go to a

931
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,470
certain site so I'm gonna tell you how

932
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,920
many are percentages our sites are HTTPS

933
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,890
and I'll let the dashboard show our

934
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,600
progress that's kind of like honestly

935
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,130
being open about this stuff too is part

936
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,230
of part of what we're trying to get out

937
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,760
as well I'm not gonna tell you all our

938
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,710
vulnerabilities but some of the ones

939
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,790
that are obvious I have no problem

940
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,780
reporting on what we're doing and

941
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,520
telling you the progress because we

942
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,780
should be held accountable this is the

943
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,510
services we're delivering to you and I'm

944
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,860
a consumer of those services too so I

945
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,050
kind of want to know what's going on

946
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,660
myself so we talked about baking it in

947
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,220
baking security and earlier to the

948
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,630
lifecycle and like I said we talked

949
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,330
about it for years in government what we

950
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,650
try to do you know something's gonna

951
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,060
force it you got a force the behavior

952
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,400
we've actually mandated all these

953
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,500
mandatory screw checks at this new

954
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,030
enterprise architecture review board

955
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,100
that we do so any kind of project that

956
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,660
does any kind of public facing thing or

957
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,400
a certain dollar value or it's a few

958
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,440
criteria that's met has to come to this

959
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,110
board for approval before it goes

960
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,880
forward and I guess who's sitting at

961
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,760
that board so I get to have security

962
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,190
insight from concept before these things

963
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,780
get out there and and that's and like I

964
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,340
said sometimes you have to bake it in

965
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,900
yourself I'd be nice to get all the

966
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,160
buy-in but somebody's got to force it

967
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,390
and this time we forced it and it's been

968
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,670
it's been working well so far I mean one

969
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,690
of the one of the challenges we have in

970
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,760
government is we have like we don't talk

971
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,100
much too with each other right and we

972
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,680
have 44 case management systems we have

973
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,570
like 50 plus grants and contribution

974
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,220
systems I'm no you know grants the

975
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,570
contributions expert but I don't know

976
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,010
how many ways there are to give a grant

977
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:05,200
or contribution like they're two maybe I

978
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,840
think it's 50 and so and I give that

979
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,400
example because now you have

980
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,080
fifty-some-odd systems that are

981
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,100
individually being accredited

982
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,780
individually I guarantee you have

983
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,490
different security postures and I

984
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,990
guarantee have gone through different

985
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,840
levels of scrutiny and so I would much

986
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,430
rather that be one system part of this

987
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,680
boards idea is to not only just build

988
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,300
insecurity up front but just rationalize

989
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,430
their IT infrastructure so in the future

990
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,230
that someone tries to build a new one

991
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,610
well hang on we already have one it's

992
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:31,930
been accredited already it's got the

993
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,820
checks it's gonna make our lives a hell

994
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,950
of a lot easier so again promoting

995
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:40,270
standardization deb-deb SEC Ops I think

996
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,700
honestly this whole DevOps thing is are

997
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,030
like prime chance to to rebrand and to

998
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,950
really help security here like you have

999
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,260
people that are iterating and developing

1000
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,580
code on a nightly or

1001
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,370
many times a day basis quite frankly and

1002
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,520
and for me I am pushing as much security

1003
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,440
automation in that process as possible I

1004
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,820
think about all the stuff we used to

1005
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,860
complain about how oh there's a bug in

1006
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,230
your system and we in the waterfall way

1007
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,970
you'd wait six months or a year for the

1008
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,260
next code release to come out before the

1009
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,880
bug can be fixed here you have a chance

1010
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,740
to fix these damn things nightly you

1011
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,060
know this is an opportunity for us to

1012
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,440
build so the more automation you build

1013
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,720
in that process the faster and I think

1014
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,650
the bugs are getting fixed and

1015
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,720
historically which I know is a bit more

1016
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,060
water folly but and maybe you felt like

1017
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,680
you had more time to assess but now you

1018
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,630
can you can build this stuff kind of

1019
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,980
back in I think this one the biggest

1020
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,840
shifts our community can make is be best

1021
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,210
friends with your developers and get

1022
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,800
your tools and get automation built into

1023
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,740
that process as early as possible that's

1024
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,810
something we're really keen on I'm

1025
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:40,360
focusing it on and and of course I got

1026
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,770
to mention it's in response cuz I just

1027
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,060
said earlier you're gonna get breach so

1028
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,920
you may as well figure out what you're

1029
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,080
gonna do when you when you are so we

1030
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,210
have a we have a plan we have exercised

1031
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,860
it I'll be honest we don't exercise that

1032
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,870
enough I'm pretty sure no one exercises

1033
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,060
it enough we do fire drills in our

1034
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,440
building like once every quarter I'm

1035
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,000
pretty sure that's because it's by law

1036
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,590
but I mean I'll be honest I've never

1037
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,360
been in a building with a fire yet knock

1038
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,100
on wood but I've seen a hundred cyber

1039
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,450
incidents and we don't practice that as

1040
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,790
much so I'd rather get into a habit of

1041
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,920
practicing response on that kind of

1042
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,420
thing we just did an exercise last month

1043
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,550
we got a whole bunch of senior ATMs in a

1044
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,100
room and and it was awesome three hours

1045
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,750
and we actually simulated stuff that

1046
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,610
that they just are not used to seeing

1047
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,440
and I wish we did this we did this once

1048
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,790
every two years now I wish we did it

1049
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,900
once every quarter like it

1050
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,010
and I know it's hard to get the time

1051
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,810
sometimes but but this kind of practice

1052
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,550
is is something that we have to get used

1053
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:32,920
to to doing some of the challenges like

1054
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,900
it's not I guess it's not all there this

1055
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,180
is just stuff we're focused on but we're

1056
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,770
like everyone else I'm sure some of

1057
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,420
these challenges are gonna resonate with

1058
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,970
you as well I mean legacy debt is

1059
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,190
something we are we have a ton of I mean

1060
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,590
I mentioned Windows 2003 earlier I wish

1061
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,780
I was joking like it's 2018 and we're

1062
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,190
still dealing with I won't tell you

1063
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,660
where but some of the some of the

1064
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,610
servers are embarrassing you know

1065
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,500
something that is huge exposure for us

1066
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,420
right now and that's why quite frankly

1067
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,370
this push to cloud is so important to me

1068
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,080
in cloud I guarantee you're not worried

1069
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,160
about when it's doesn't three anymore

1070
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,150
you worry about other stuff

1071
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,360
but at least you get some of this this

1072
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,440
crazy stuff that I think is that we're

1073
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,440
worried about out of the way you know so

1074
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,639
worried about a different different part

1075
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,630
of the stack you got a bunch of smart

1076
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,310
people working here in this room or

1077
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,230
working for you or whatever I don't want

1078
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,760
them working on upgrading operating

1079
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,020
systems all the time while I'm working

1080
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,480
on smart stuff so I like know we have a

1081
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,400
ton of work to do here this is I'm

1082
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,620
really hoping we can speed up the game

1083
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:31,239
with cloud the rapidly changing tack

1084
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,550
Amin that's nothing new except it just

1085
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,900
it just feels like it's faster before

1086
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,880
like I honestly I found it was hard

1087
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,340
enough to keep up with cyber before and

1088
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,870
now you got like blockchain and AI and

1089
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,420
IOT and like fridges talking and it's

1090
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,699
just ridiculous like it's it's it's hard

1091
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:47,139
enough before it's gonna be harder in

1092
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:48,040
the future it's not getting any easier

1093
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,350
I'll be honest with ya which is why all

1094
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,610
the stuff I said earlier about

1095
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:54,280
automation and and and standardization

1096
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,409
and making our jobs a bit more efficient

1097
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:58,690
has to has to come true because we will

1098
00:34:58,690 --> 00:34:59,710
never build to keep up with this stuff

1099
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,730
and I'll tell you right now like we're

1100
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:01,570
already

1101
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:04,060
I know AI is a nice little like we're

1102
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,530
not in your Skynet yet but if you're not

1103
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,120
having AI conversations with your AI

1104
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,620
people right now you're probably you're

1105
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,390
too late but I would be engaged early

1106
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,890
you got to be cutting edge on this stuff

1107
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,480
and engage on this stuff now if you if

1108
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,550
you if you want to be if you don't to be

1109
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,080
caught behind like especially in the in

1110
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,030
the world where business lines or trying

1111
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,980
to be you know in digital transformation

1112
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,480
the buzzword and trying to be agile all

1113
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,860
this stuff they're gonna be they're

1114
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,150
gonna be implementing this stuff a lot

1115
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,860
faster than historically they have been

1116
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,540
so it behooves us to get involved in

1117
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:32,980
those conversations a lot earlier and

1118
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,140
and this is an obvious one and talent

1119
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,100
shortage I mean this

1120
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,840
I don't know to say other than we're all

1121
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,920
in this boat

1122
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,720
I heard numbers like 2 to 3 million

1123
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,930
short by 2021 the numbers seem to shift

1124
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,760
every year but but hey we're all the

1125
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,960
same boat we fight for the same people

1126
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,360
so well that tells me again more to be

1127
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,000
more efficient but also sharing info

1128
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,590
with one another across your state like

1129
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,720
honesty cyber has no boundaries only

1130
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,070
we're the ones that draw the boundaries

1131
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,440
between federal provincial private

1132
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,630
international there is no boundary for

1133
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,190
cyber so we may as well leverage as much

1134
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,220
as we human can and you know find

1135
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,480
parallels draw the man and that's why I

1136
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,400
said about working in the open we're

1137
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,500
posting all our stuff for cloud for

1138
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,410
passwords for HTTPS public like go you

1139
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:16,630
want to do in your organizations use it

1140
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,970
I want like wheat that's the only way

1141
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,040
we're gonna do this like I don't think

1142
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,390
if all of us try to tackle the same

1143
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,890
things individually I'm not sure that's

1144
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,310
gonna be a recipe for success so like I

1145
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,900
said same problems same challenges this

1146
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,330
is kind of my we're all in this together

1147
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:34,210
part of the presentation but like I said

1148
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:37,090
like Altima take to conclude really the

1149
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,620
main topic here is that it's about

1150
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,510
digital transformation now gives us the

1151
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,950
opportunity to change a bit and I'm just

1152
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,960
I guess I'm saying go back to your

1153
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,190
communities talk to them with some of

1154
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,170
the pragmatism that you can offer talked

1155
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,570
about being a bit more practical try to

1156
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,980
make a bit more of those risk-based

1157
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,320
decisions balance a bit more I mean this

1158
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,210
is the only way we're gonna get we're

1159
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,130
gonna get anywhere with them and I think

1160
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,510
if any of this is gonna work in the

1161
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,530
future this digital things gonna work

1162
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,540
you have to be involved in it and this

1163
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,150
us-versus-them kind of mentality has to

1164
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,120
be the first thing that goes so I think

1165
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,830
I think it's it I'll stop rambling now

1166
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,560
Thanks
