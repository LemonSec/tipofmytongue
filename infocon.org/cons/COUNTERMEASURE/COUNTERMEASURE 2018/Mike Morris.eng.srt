1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,170
yeah I am former I am a former ta o

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,940
operator so if you guys haven't heard

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,280
NSA has a program called tailored access

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,420
operations where essentially they have

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,309
certified operators that chase down

6
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:17,060
terrorists and things of that nature I

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,480
was doing operations in ta o through mid

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,779
2011 when I was at ta o I was

9
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,910
responsible for running counterterrorism

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,310
operations as the technical director for

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,110
C T so I bring a fresh perspective I'd

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,649
say to kind of the cyber defensive realm

13
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,690
and what I'd like to talk about today is

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,750
is walk through what is hunt operations

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,329
and kind of the concept then the way

16
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,289
that we see it inside route 9b let me

17
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,460
give you a little background on who

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,430
route 9b is so we are we are a

19
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,010
commercial entity what makes us unique

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,469
is I have more than 40 former ta o

21
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,809
operators on staff conducting operations

22
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,739
for our clients as part of it we provide

23
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,380
several different services so we started

24
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,600
out in the training realm training for

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,760
us being focused around operational

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,090
execution so we teach we teach students

27
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,040
how to exploit how to maintain

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,170
tradecraft how not to get caught and

29
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,970
then we teach them how to go and defend

30
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,710
against those same capabilities so

31
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,930
bypassing security products then how to

32
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,210
use the security product or use open

33
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,740
source capabilities to go through and

34
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,439
find find them we have an emerging

35
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,240
technologies division emerging

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,430
technologies is product development so I

37
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,200
have everything from a hunt platform

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,840
which I'll show you guys today through

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,150
to a credential assessment capability as

40
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,159
well as a couple other unique

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,509
capabilities that we provide to our

42
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,030
commercial clients we have cyber

43
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,430
operations cyber operations for us is

44
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,040
really focused around hunt operations

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,829
using folks that understand how an

46
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,049
adversary maneuvers will remote into a

47
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:59,310
client's infrastructure and then

48
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,740
actively engage to get into a cyber

49
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,240
Knife fight with an adversary

50
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,649
essentially we're looking for those

51
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,930
folks that are bypassing your EDR

52
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,080
platforms in addition to that we do all

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,030
your traditional IT security stuff so

54
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,590
pentesting vulnerable

55
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,989
the assessments malware analysis

56
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:17,040
everything that the industry's been

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,349
doing for the last 20 plus years we roll

58
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:20,629
that up in there as well

59
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:24,540
threat intelligence were we're not a

60
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,060
threat feed so what my threat Intel team

61
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,760
is is made up of a group of analysts

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,950
that have conducted operations in the

63
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,080
past and really what they provide is

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,450
threat knowledge so they'll sit there

65
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,370
they lurk in the dark web they've

66
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,920
created seasoned personas they've become

67
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,080
friends with organizations like

68
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,970
anonymous and then they sit there and

69
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,549
monitor their IRC chats identify if

70
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:49,319
they're going to potentially launch a

71
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,120
campaign and then they take that data

72
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,630
and they roll that back into our clients

73
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,739
so I'm holding two different ways here

74
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,959
and then we have network defense

75
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,140
operations so network defense operations

76
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,120
has really managed security services or

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,329
MDR services for the organization we

78
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:08,489
never we didn't initially intend to move

79
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,230
into that space we were really looking

80
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,360
to be a hunt provider but what was

81
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,120
happening is as I was coming in many of

82
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,609
my clients would have an MSS provider

83
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:19,769
already we wouldn't tell the MSS

84
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:21,239
provider that we are coming and then we

85
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,709
deploy our payloads across the

86
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:24,269
environment without pre-configuration

87
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:27,090
and the MSS provider went and see us and

88
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,280
so then the clients started to get

89
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,630
themself into a spot where they said

90
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,209
well wait a second if route 9b is able

91
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:34,920
to essentially exploit on the my machine

92
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,599
and navigate through my network and I'm

93
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,650
not being told

94
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,930
then what service are you providing for

95
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,239
me so in a lot of cases they started to

96
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,040
move away from the MSS and gave us the

97
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,540
data which has really been fantastic

98
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,310
because it allows for us to focus our

99
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,019
hunt operations the last kind of bullet

100
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,099
point here that I want to talk about is

101
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:59,910
to to us in route 9b cybersecurity well

102
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,430
let me step back if I look at the

103
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,709
majority of organizations that say they

104
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:06,599
are cyber security companies what I'd

105
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,200
say is that 98% of them our IT security

106
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,569
firms that have rebranded because the

107
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:14,910
word cyber sexy and there's money tied

108
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,720
to it to us in route 9b cybersecurity is

109
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,630
the convergence of IT security ot

110
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,090
security and intelligence all brought

111
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,190
together without intelligence

112
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,510
it's just ITC

113
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,450
security and ot security and so for us

114
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,820
everything we do inside the organization

115
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,610
has an intelligence aspect to it we're

116
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,080
constantly learning and then rolling

117
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,140
that back into the capabilities I think

118
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,790
this has gone a long way especially here

119
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,890
in Canada with sapper labs we recently

120
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,920
just one defense ideas and so we'll be

121
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,380
providing some attribution type work to

122
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:55,500
the Canadian government all right let's

123
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,600
step into the the real discussion now

124
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,350
so this slide up here everyone's seen it

125
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,810
its traditional defense-in-depth if you

126
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,310
go through you get your degree or you

127
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,800
take CISSP this is what's being touted

128
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,240
as the way to secure your environment as

129
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,370
we follow this all we keep doing is

130
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,920
stacking technology on top of each other

131
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,950
in the current environment today so

132
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,960
we're taking in IDs we take EDR

133
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,150
platforms we basically will add

134
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,550
perimeter security products but the

135
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,850
problem is it's not really helping it's

136
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,520
not stopping the JPMorgan's from being

137
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,860
breached an adversary is still getting

138
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,770
in because the adversary understands

139
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,930
that we are going to secure ourselves in

140
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,790
this manner and that we're going to

141
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,770
follow specific compliance rules and

142
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,810
everything else and effectively we are

143
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,840
creating a playbook for the adversary to

144
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,610
be able to maneuver and exploit your

145
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,430
operating environment in addition by

146
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,560
stacking technology on top top of each

147
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,620
other well we're finding in the security

148
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,680
industry is that many cases when you

149
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,840
deploy maybe an antivirus and a needy

150
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,880
are together that you're actually

151
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,620
creating additional vulnerabilities that

152
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,620
you didn't know about or and by bringing

153
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,200
these capabilities in it's allowing the

154
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,360
adversary to use those to their

155
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,300
advantage if we were to take a look and

156
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,330
put it in a physical model here

157
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,220
essentially what we've done is we've

158
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,240
created a secure perimeter and the model

159
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,820
we've gone after is stop the adversary

160
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,420
from ever getting in you will never ever

161
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,270
achieve that you can try all that you

162
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,190
want but an adversary is going to breach

163
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,380
your network security has to adapt

164
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,210
from trying to stop them from being able

165
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,030
to gain initial access to stopping them

166
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,460
from getting to their motive don't allow

167
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,990
them to get to their critical

168
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,630
infrastructure effectively by putting

169
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,020
firewalls and IDS's and IPS is and just

170
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,390
sticking them on the outside once you

171
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,820
get Spearfish that's 1995 hacking at its

172
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,340
finest net use past the hash for the win

173
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,950
right so we've essentially allowed our

174
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,560
internal our internal networks to be a

175
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,110
soft squishy Center we've conceded that

176
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,750
space in the security environment today

177
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,540
this slide I think is the evidence of

178
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,180
what I'm talking about in every one of

179
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,940
these cases and what I'd say if I if I

180
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,580
went up to that siz oh he probably had

181
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,850
whatever the newest technology was the

182
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,320
prob and the technology probably

183
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,230
actually saw it or caught it but didn't

184
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,540
necessarily stop it no one is

185
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,670
complaining that they don't have enough

186
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,740
data

187
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,330
everyone has too much data now the

188
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,430
problem is no one knows what to look for

189
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,620
because we're trying to stop everything

190
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,700
as opposed to being focused around our

191
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,000
infrastructure around our networks let's

192
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,030
consider a few things here when we take

193
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,290
a look at it from an attacker

194
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,160
perspective in my previous life when I

195
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,640
was exploiting or going after a target I

196
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,100
would initially perform reconnaissance I

197
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,680
would go through and I'd find a way that

198
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,170
to go and enable access for myself in

199
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,990
that operating environment once I ended

200
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,540
up gaining access after I did recon and

201
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,880
exploit it onto the target the next

202
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,680
thing that I would do is I would go

203
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,710
steal their security settings I would

204
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,770
basically take what antivirus what EDR

205
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,780
product do they have what passive

206
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,909
technologies do they have around me that

207
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,590
potentially could catch me when I

208
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,960
maneuvering through the network I would

209
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,360
then take that I would come back into a

210
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,240
virtual environment and I recreate that

211
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,590
operating environment

212
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,750
that would allow for me to know that if

213
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,480
I do a and B as an attacker security

214
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,270
product will do C so I'll do a and D

215
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,790
so that I can maintain access I would

216
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,580
then continuously monitor that target to

217
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,250
go through and identify what security

218
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,720
mechanisms are they going to put in

219
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,000
place or changes are they putting and

220
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,220
then before they could deploy those I

221
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,830
would go and put those in inside my

222
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,020
little virtual environment or my lab and

223
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,120
I would test again and that would allow

224
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,459
for me to maintain persistent access on

225
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:21,000
my targets for several years at a time

226
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,740
it allowed for me to continuously out

227
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,779
mover the outmaneuver the defender

228
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:27,279
because they would go through their

229
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,470
testing components as well and then that

230
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,810
would that would allow for me to to be

231
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,750
successful now I'd give you that that

232
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,000
background here because the attacker has

233
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,260
a motive the attacker has a methodology

234
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,750
the attacker is a human that understands

235
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,300
how to get around the automated security

236
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,050
products that you're putting in place

237
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,420
what we are not doing as defenders is we

238
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,810
are not matching the attacker on the

239
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,180
playing field we're not putting another

240
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,910
human defender maneuvering through the

241
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,700
network ready to engage as a former

242
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,730
attacker there was no no pain caused to

243
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,970
me once I got in your environment if I

244
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,459
lost a payload or I lost some specific

245
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:14,410
capability that was fine because I could

246
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,970
continuously go through and maneuver

247
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,700
there was really no fear and I would not

248
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,940
use my O'Dea in every single instance I

249
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,310
would use whatever the lowest possible

250
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,220
capability was 1995 hacking net use

251
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,740
right like I said I would use that every

252
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,209
chance I could once I was in the network

253
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:33,720
so that I went and burn my capabilities

254
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,209
so really that bullet point there

255
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:40,029
humans are thinking right they're

256
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:42,910
adapting your attacker is adapting to

257
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,640
your network environment it's time that

258
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,950
as security professionals we started

259
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,740
that thing our network environments to

260
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:56,620
the attackers I pretty much already hit

261
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,450
on this point really the one I want to

262
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,880
drive home is kind of that last bullet

263
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,279
point the chief scientists at route 9b

264
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,250
de Vaux Smith he does quite a bit on

265
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,400
trying to secure airplanes and

266
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,130
submarines and everything else and I

267
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,380
thought his quote at a conference not

268
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,840
too long ago was spot-on we're likely

269
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,790
we're as likely to build a secure

270
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,370
computer system as we are to build an

271
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,830
aircraft that cannot be shot down in

272
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:27,970
this environment we are being challenged

273
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,910
by sophisticated adversaries whether

274
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,280
it's an organization like Anonymous or a

275
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,240
nation-state adversary like a Russian

276
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,780
apt yet we are and you are are in

277
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,370
control of your operating environment

278
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,570
and responsible for the security of that

279
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:54,250
environment yet we are not spending or

280
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,000
putting the ability for our people to be

281
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,240
able to defend the network appropriately

282
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,010
one of the one of the kind of concepts I

283
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,050
think it's almost like asking our people

284
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,440
to stand on the front line without a gun

285
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,420
we wouldn't do that in the military so

286
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,190
why are we doing it with computer

287
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:17,530
networks and environments all right so

288
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:21,310
what is hunting so there's a lot of

289
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,990
concepts out there and it's a very

290
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,880
muddied word for anyone that's heard of

291
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,000
threat hunting organiz there's a couple

292
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,680
different takes some organizations look

293
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,010
at it as event log analysis that is not

294
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,700
hunting to me it's a necessary

295
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,350
requirement when you're doing security

296
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,840
but going through and doing event log

297
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,710
analysis is an after-the-fact analytics

298
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,020
environment that causes you then to go

299
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,440
and respond additionally what what I

300
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,510
find some folks saying threat hunting is

301
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,240
is looking at network traffic after the

302
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,980
fact in fact there's one financial

303
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,700
institution that has hunt parties once a

304
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,700
month so every 30 days they have a hunt

305
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,960
party and they look through all their

306
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,060
logs and then when they identify a

307
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,380
potential breach they go and make a

308
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,570
change that is no different than what we

309
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,180
are doing in the early 2000s that is

310
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,340
still not hunting to me so the way that

311
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,620
I see hunting is it's maneuver warfare

312
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,160
in your own operating environment it's

313
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,899
allowing humans

314
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:26,079
to go through and look for an adversary

315
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,240
bypassing your security products and

316
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,290
then actively engage the adversary find

317
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,100
them fix it and finish right that's

318
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,050
really what hunting is it's about

319
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,689
allowing a human to go through your

320
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:43,600
environment and patrol through their

321
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,279
space looking for that 5% or 7% of

322
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:50,559
sophisticated attackers that know how to

323
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,740
bypass those products or to maneuver in

324
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,410
your operating environment there's some

325
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,230
things to consider defenders actually

326
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,689
understand their network or they should

327
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:03,790
I'll take that back they should

328
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,230
understand their network we know what

329
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:05,769
reality is

330
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:09,100
so they actually they have the advantage

331
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,009
the problem is attackers when they come

332
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:13,600
in they have to learn your environment

333
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,369
and they will take whatever that kind of

334
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:18,670
soft squishy Center is and maneuver to

335
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,709
that machine but they're there for a

336
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:23,470
motive they're not exploiting every

337
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,079
single box when I would exploit into an

338
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,089
environment I knew what I was coming for

339
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:30,490
maybe it's the domain controller maybe I

340
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,709
want to steal source code maybe I want

341
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:35,769
some PII data and I will navigate to the

342
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:37,620
machines that are housing those I'm not

343
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,879
doing like the defenders doing and

344
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,129
trying to go through and look at it logs

345
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:44,139
from every single endpoint that I have

346
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:46,300
in that in that environment they're very

347
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,350
strategic very tactical so let's look at

348
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,740
this model again what I'm proposing and

349
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,050
what I propose for Hunt is putting the

350
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,509
human back at the center of the

351
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:00,910
operations so if you take a look here

352
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,470
let's pretend that this was a physical

353
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,290
model I'll use a being former military

354
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,019
I'll use a military installation if I

355
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:09,939
was driving up to a military

356
00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:12,850
installation for a meeting as I start

357
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,679
driving to that installation I'm going

358
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,689
to see a fence going around the compound

359
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:19,149
there's going to be barbed wire on top

360
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:20,740
of the fence there's going to be a

361
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,230
camera probably in every single corner

362
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,779
that I go to I'll pull up to the front

363
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:27,850
gate the guards gonna be there checking

364
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,790
my ID to make sure I can come on he's

365
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,470
probably going to have a gun and there's

366
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,089
gonna be a barricade stopping me from

367
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:36,550
being able to just drive on through

368
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,010
after they check my access and verify

369
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,050
that I can get on to that base for

370
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,690
legitimate reasons they'll allow me to

371
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,240
drive through that compound as I Drive

372
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,410
through I'm probably going to pass

373
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,080
military troop formations maybe some

374
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,500
armored vehicles more cameras more SiC

375
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,080
control controlled buildings on there so

376
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,720
in that model they're in in that

377
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,160
physical model that I just described the

378
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,950
fence and the barbed wire are not going

379
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:09,040
to stop me from gaining access if I want

380
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,600
to get over the 13 foot fence I bring a

381
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,110
14-foot ladder right every one of those

382
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,100
components though are there to help

383
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,020
enable the defender the camera is

384
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,480
providing telemetry to let them know

385
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,400
whether or not I actually was able to

386
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,760
get on and if I'd now put that back to

387
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,560
cybersecurity and the way we're doing it

388
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,960
today all that we have is we have

389
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,000
basically that fence and that barbed

390
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,070
wire and then we have someone monitoring

391
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,020
the camera and then when there's a

392
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,000
breach they call someone and then

393
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,280
someone goes and shows up there's no one

394
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,070
actively going through and making sure

395
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,700
that there's a not an attacker already

396
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,190
gaining access and so what you look at

397
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,350
here is this is how I see cyber security

398
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,850
really coming together

399
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,400
a true cyber security approach would

400
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,180
have one a good training foundation but

401
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,770
two you would have an attack surface

402
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,810
baseline you would attempt to come after

403
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,780
yourself the way the adversary would not

404
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,020
just doing an expose basically launch

405
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,700
next pose and then dump out the 400-page

406
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,790
report it's helpful but it's not really

407
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,250
security right instead what I what I

408
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,990
propose is understanding how an

409
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,450
adversary would come after you

410
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,380
understanding the groups that are most

411
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,660
likely to attack you and then testing

412
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,579
against your perimeter products to make

413
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,000
sure they can't bypass next everyone has

414
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,520
pretty much everyone has a sock nowadays

415
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,110
right or they're all headed that way

416
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,970
so you have managed security services

417
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,940
that are collecting data from your EDR

418
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,430
platforms from your web forwarding your

419
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,080
syslog data whatever have you

420
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,650
all of that is really good data that

421
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,270
allows for you to identify that

422
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,320
someone's there

423
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,570
and then respond that's traditional

424
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,659
traditional security as you get into the

425
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,480
center here this is really where the

426
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,570
crux comes in of hunt hunt is putting a

427
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,919
human back at the center of the

428
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:04,450
operations as I had mentioned and

429
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,240
allowing them to navigate look for an

430
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,880
adversary and then actively engage in

431
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,029
your operating environment and so the

432
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:16,590
way that I propose hunt to happen is

433
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,950
using an offensive minded approach sit

434
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,659
back the way an attacker would and

435
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:24,330
navigate through your environment

436
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,509
looking for an anomaly as you identify

437
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,580
the anomaly it then turns into an

438
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,019
incident response and forensic type

439
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:34,750
investigation now in this approach

440
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,789
though with hunt what I'm not talking

441
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:40,240
about is you were not hunting 1 million

442
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,490
machines all at the same time that's

443
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,460
what an antivirus is for instead what

444
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,299
I'm talking about

445
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:49,769
is understanding your business context

446
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:52,149
understand your critical infrastructure

447
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:53,769
realizing yet it could be multiple

448
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:57,340
things assume that an attacker when they

449
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,129
compromise you is going to navigate to

450
00:19:00,129 --> 00:19:04,149
that path so when you're hunting in that

451
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:06,309
type of environment you hunt the

452
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:08,919
critical infrastructure and slowly peel

453
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:10,120
back the layers hitting different

454
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,769
Network segments looking for anomalies

455
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:13,899
that are taking place and then come up

456
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:17,200
with a plan to actively engage now in

457
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,210
addition to that you see there's a

458
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,539
threat Intel line that goes through

459
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,399
threat Intel feeds each of these

460
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:27,309
components I talked about the attackers

461
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:29,500
are adapting to your environment once

462
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,289
they identify that you bought product X

463
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:34,179
they figure out their way around and

464
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:35,639
that's how they're going to come come in

465
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:38,019
what defenders need to do is they need

466
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:39,960
to be able to adapt to the attacker

467
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,460
instead of chasing file paths and

468
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,919
signatures from a threat Intel feed you

469
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:46,539
should be understanding why they would

470
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:47,860
come after you where they would try to

471
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,789
maneuver and focus your energy there by

472
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:53,500
being able to be focused there the

473
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,659
threat Intel will constantly end up

474
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:57,970
changing the way that you implement your

475
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,500
security practices and mechanism so

476
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,430
adversary

477
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,310
suit to us is allowing for an

478
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,250
interactive operator to sit in a

479
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,070
sock-like environment and execute

480
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,000
operations it's proactive in its

481
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,850
approach it's going back and making sure

482
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,220
that your investments that you've put in

483
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,070
to your EDR products and your abs and

484
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,660
everything else that they're actually

485
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,960
finding what they should be and if

486
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,810
they're not it's allowing for you or the

487
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,620
human to do the active engagement

488
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,410
identify and respond the way we caused

489
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,750
pain to an adversary is by burning his

490
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,360
capabilities forcing him to go different

491
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,670
paths when it's hard on the on the

492
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,620
attacker the attacker will go to a

493
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:54,250
different network I this already when

494
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,810
you're when you're conducting hunt

495
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,090
operations if I was doing a forensic

496
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,190
investigation I have a patient zero

497
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:03,250
that's what caused me to go in and do

498
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,960
that investigation right there's

499
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,670
something there that is forcing me to

500
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,670
look at it is a post-mortem incident

501
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,430
response I have a patient zero as well I

502
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,170
had something that's causing me to

503
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,720
elevate it to become an incident when

504
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,950
you're doing hunt operations

505
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,710
everything's a patient zero you need to

506
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,390
assume that your network is already

507
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,120
compromised and that the adversary is is

508
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,950
going to maneuver to take your data or

509
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:32,080
whatever have you hunt will always lead

510
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,660
to an incident response investigation if

511
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,630
you're proactive then you should be

512
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,460
finding adversaries in your network and

513
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,440
then you should be coming up with a plan

514
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,620
to be able to go and execute we have a

515
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,890
retail client that gets breached every

516
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:52,450
single month no lie every single month

517
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,450
they have a breach but they're

518
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,850
conducting proactive operations and the

519
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,750
adversary has never been able to get to

520
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,780
their end goal now as I mentioned

521
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,210
earlier I don't ever tell a client we

522
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,580
are going to stop them from being

523
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,280
breached because it's impossible what we

524
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,640
do is we focus when we're hunting again

525
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,080
around keeping them from being a

526
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,180
to live in the operating environment for

527
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,400
whatever the new stat is 140 days or so

528
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,700
so in order to execute hunt you need to

529
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,960
have a methodology the methodology

530
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,270
really needs to be focused again around

531
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,670
the human defender being in that

532
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,700
operating environment and having full

533
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,340
freedom of movement and full control to

534
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,430
actively engage they need the attacker

535
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,500
to start looking over their shoulder

536
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,880
when they're exploiting in the way that

537
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,650
I see hunt operations is through a

538
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,040
basically a four-step approach first

539
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:03,550
phase one in mass collection you could

540
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,580
do that today with the EDR products you

541
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,940
could do it today through WMI whatever

542
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,220
you have you could use those

543
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,220
capabilities to reach out and collect

544
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,770
now when you're pulling it back instead

545
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,080
of looking for signatures you should be

546
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,630
looking for anomalies the easiest way to

547
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,420
do this when you're hunting understand

548
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,570
your network right get a baseline build

549
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,680
a baseline because you probably all have

550
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,240
a gold image so build a baseline and

551
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,370
then from there do comparisons of your

552
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,790
collection against those baselines as

553
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,230
you go through and you're pulling back

554
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,820
data through the in mass collection

555
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,550
that's going to lead into ultimately

556
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,160
what's the second phase identification

557
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,240
of an IOC indicator of compromise that's

558
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,550
going to give you an anomaly to go and

559
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,700
start to do the investigation for now

560
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,340
all of this that I'm talking through I'm

561
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,980
talking about doing it remotely doing it

562
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,540
interactively from a centralized

563
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,570
location executing against hosts in your

564
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,630
environment from there after you

565
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,240
identify the IOC it becomes targeted

566
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,540
collection and forensics now much of

567
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,510
that much of those first three steps

568
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,940
that I just kind of alluded to are in

569
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,160
many people's incident response plans

570
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,140
today they're just not doing it

571
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,000
continuously going through the network

572
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,770
in a stealthy manner looking for the

573
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,930
adversary finally

574
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,880
the thing about hunt so those first

575
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,130
three there is a plethora of

576
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,720
organizations that say they hunt and

577
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:41,020
only do those that is collection it's a

578
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,450
subset of what hunt is but what hunt

579
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,900
really is is response activities that's

580
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,690
how I see hunt this would be for any of

581
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,090
you that that actually hunt animals and

582
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,620
I hate using this analogy but it's a

583
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,580
good one it this component we don't call

584
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,500
hunt let me step back we don't call hunt

585
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,850
in in that space

586
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,310
sticking a GoPro in a tree stand and

587
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,750
then going back and checking it

588
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,690
that is not hunt we need that data but

589
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,400
in cybersecurity that's very much what

590
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,560
we're doing right that's that event log

591
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,240
analysis I'm talking about after the

592
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,250
fact and that's what what some folks are

593
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,130
calling hunt what hunt is is having a

594
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,140
human there with a rifle ready to shoot

595
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,300
that human is going to be disguised

596
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,730
going to be stealthy going to try to

597
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,890
blend into the environment so that he

598
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,430
can target his prey

599
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,810
this is what I'm talking about in

600
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,690
cybersecurity hunt requires a response

601
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:38,500
activity and it requires essentially a

602
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,060
methodology of how you're going to to

603
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,460
interact that methodology is going to be

604
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,110
different for every single person in

605
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,940
this room and for every business based

606
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,880
off of context in order to be successful

607
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,550
organizations need to build a common

608
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,340
platform for themselves now there's a

609
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,110
number of different capabilities out

610
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,180
there that allow for for you to be able

611
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,550
to go through and execute hunt

612
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,610
operations CrowdStrike Falcon would be a

613
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,410
good idea our platform for you to be

614
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,420
able to go through and start doing those

615
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:15,650
types of activities what they do is when

616
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,870
you're doing this you should be doing it

617
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,510
more stealthy so predominantly or

618
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,790
preferably you would not have a

619
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,920
persistent agent that was sitting there

620
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,230
for the adversary to see and the reason

621
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,790
I say that is if you think back to what

622
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,710
I explained the way I used to attack I

623
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,660
would steal that persistent agent's

624
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,160
capabilities and figure out how am I

625
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,080
going to go through and maneuver so it

626
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,940
should be an agentless technology that's

627
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,820
being used by a human defender to

628
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,549
execute you also don't

629
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:46,749
automate everything automation is good

630
00:26:46,749 --> 00:26:49,519
technology's good you need it but you

631
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,779
can't automate the human the human

632
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,460
attacker will figure out what those

633
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,059
response activities are going to be the

634
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:02,720
end goal is really to try to cause pain

635
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,830
to that adversary but focus on not

636
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,889
allowing them to get to their intended

637
00:27:09,889 --> 00:27:13,399
target so we need to think like the

638
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,259
adversary and maneuver like the

639
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,899
adversary we need to be stealthy in the

640
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:19,879
approach and very tactical in the

641
00:27:19,879 --> 00:27:22,220
engagement of how we are going to to

642
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,539
take them out once we identify them some

643
00:27:26,539 --> 00:27:27,950
additional things I hit on a bunch of

644
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,409
these already you want the ability to be

645
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:33,129
able to detect and engage the attacker

646
00:27:33,129 --> 00:27:36,379
so when the attacker is there you want

647
00:27:36,379 --> 00:27:37,700
to be able to get into the CyberKnife

648
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,710
fight with them you want to be able to

649
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,019
get into that hand-to-hand combat so

650
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:44,600
that the attacker is now on the

651
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,789
defensive he's trying to figure out what

652
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:48,919
can he do what should he do where does

653
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:51,499
he go from there the capability also

654
00:27:51,499 --> 00:27:53,869
shouldn't be only is solely focused

655
00:27:53,869 --> 00:27:57,169
around Windows and Linux machines really

656
00:27:57,169 --> 00:27:59,269
any capability or platform that you have

657
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:00,440
should be able to pull off of a

658
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,559
pacemaker if you want to or an internet

659
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:05,570
some internet of things maybe a

660
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:08,059
satellite hop you should be able to

661
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:10,789
engage any one of those environments

662
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,519
collect data and correlate it in a

663
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,769
unified platform so that you can have

664
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:20,960
visualization back to the automated

665
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,960
piece I often get asked why we didn't go

666
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,779
fully automate it and I'll save you from

667
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:27,830
going through all the bullet points on

668
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,480
the slide but at the end of the day it's

669
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,330
exactly what I said the human will

670
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,489
figure out what the response activity is

671
00:28:34,489 --> 00:28:35,659
going to be from the automated platform

672
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:39,409
and so any any capability you have you

673
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:41,450
need to really combine those two the

674
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,460
human has to be able to engage with the

675
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,059
technology so that they can actively

676
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:49,789
actively pursue that adversary when

677
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:51,529
you're doing operations like this as

678
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:52,759
well I guess I should have said earlier

679
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:54,519
when you're conducting hunt operations

680
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:57,049
the nice thing about hunt in this

681
00:28:57,049 --> 00:29:00,049
approach is you control all of the

682
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:02,480
assets already if you're a corporation

683
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,269
and so you can reach in your environment

684
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:08,239
collect data and pursue adversaries and

685
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:10,759
engage them without violating any laws

686
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:14,029
you can also passively collect data or

687
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:17,389
intelligence beyond the wire beyond your

688
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:20,330
perimeter to see are they coming after

689
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:23,330
you and then you can take that data and

690
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,820
you can actually start to hand it over

691
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,940
to people with the appropriate authority

692
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,519
like an FBI or or something that effect

693
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,529
where they can act they can go beyond

694
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:37,639
and take it to prosecution let's talk

695
00:29:37,639 --> 00:29:39,109
about a couple concepts and then I'll

696
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:42,830
show you guys a product there's this

697
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:47,480
agent verse agentless concept that I

698
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,149
want to hit on so I talked about

699
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:52,879
persistent agents many of you already

700
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:55,039
have a persistent agent inside your

701
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,419
environment think of it like an

702
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:59,090
antivirus type solution those

703
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,730
capabilities are good but they are

704
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:05,749
defeatable I hope I'm not telling anyone

705
00:30:05,749 --> 00:30:07,460
something new there right those

706
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,440
capabilities are defeatable a good

707
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,269
adversary is gonna figure out how to get

708
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:11,690
around

709
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:14,330
so the agentless approach that i'm

710
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,309
talking about is really just in time

711
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:19,159
execution concept you don't want to be

712
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:20,960
residing on the box constantly because

713
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,580
the adversary when they get there will

714
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,440
identify what that technology is and

715
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,739
then go back and do do testing so by

716
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:29,359
being able to hunt with an agentless

717
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:32,299
approach you are maintaining the ability

718
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:34,100
to stealthily maneuver through that

719
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,559
network so the adversary does not know

720
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,129
you're there and deliver capability just

721
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:43,549
in time so really just shoving something

722
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:45,559
out to the Machine executing collecting

723
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:48,379
data pulling it back there's some

724
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:51,499
advantages to that advantages being if

725
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:53,840
it's done right you can have global

726
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,529
reach to any product that's out there as

727
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:59,509
well as it gives significant amounts of

728
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:05,240
scalability talk through this that you

729
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,759
have no persistence and it's harder for

730
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:09,379
the adversary to know that it's there

731
00:31:09,379 --> 00:31:10,970
and in most cases today

732
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,350
they're not looking over their shoulder

733
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,840
any hunt platform that gets developed I

734
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,370
talked about should have a response

735
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,440
activity but you should have the ability

736
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,480
to be able to collect metadata pull back

737
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,750
files be able to parse memory remotely

738
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,020
over the wire and then be able to really

739
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:35,270
again respond to two other concepts I

740
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:39,250
want to hit real quick in an exploit

741
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,720
when the attacker throws it exploit and

742
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,169
gains gains access there's really two

743
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:48,530
parts to any exploit there's the

744
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,840
vulnerability which in most cases is the

745
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,580
spearfishing it's the end user right

746
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,950
there's the vulnerability and there's

747
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:58,370
the payload when the exploit gets

748
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:01,789
delivered if there's no payload attached

749
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:03,830
then all you're going to have is an

750
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,350
exploit that does nothing the payload is

751
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,049
the real special sauce in that exploit

752
00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:10,820
environment that could be anything from

753
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,400
a denial service through to an implant

754
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,710
through to whatever they're looking to

755
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:18,770
achieve so very important concept

756
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,580
because what is being used in most cases

757
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,690
is they will take that payload and use

758
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,610
it over and over again and if it's a

759
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,770
well-written payload infrastructure with

760
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,780
polymorphism built in then they're going

761
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,700
to be able to maintain access in your

762
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,020
environment for a long period of time

763
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,730
second concept I want to talk about real

764
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:45,409
quick is the concept of a stager so for

765
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:47,150
those of you that that aren't really

766
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:50,360
technical when an exploit gets delivered

767
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,909
and the payload gets executed back in

768
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:55,100
1995 we would basically throw the

769
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,669
exploit and and the payload and

770
00:32:57,669 --> 00:33:00,350
everything would be on the target from a

771
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,210
forensic standpoint the forensic

772
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:04,010
investigator would come up they take a

773
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,690
memory image or they take a live memory

774
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,970
image and they knew all of my capability

775
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:11,840
right so what the attackers started to

776
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,510
do is move to a staging infrastructure

777
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:17,179
and so what it is is it allows for a

778
00:33:17,179 --> 00:33:20,809
modular type environment so when I throw

779
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:23,740
my first exploit and I gain access

780
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,950
that stager will call back and execute

781
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:29,590
some code typically when it calls back

782
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,980
it'll grab what we call the stage right

783
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,440
and insert that directly into memory so

784
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,870
if you've written from an attacker

785
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,240
perspective if I've written a good first

786
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,730
stage then I'm going to be able to

787
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,100
maintain access for example everyone

788
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,890
probably has heard of Metasploit

789
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:49,059
Metasploit works off of a stage

790
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:51,070
meterpreter works off a stage type

791
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,620
infrastructure if I rewrite the first

792
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,779
stage like I do in Python and things

793
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:58,029
like that i bypass whatever the endpoint

794
00:33:58,029 --> 00:34:00,159
security product is allowing for me to

795
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,539
have access and then I can use

796
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,000
traditional meterpreter capabilities now

797
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,480
when you do this in today's environment

798
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,629
most hackers allow for their code base

799
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:13,270
to stay directly in memory so they will

800
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:16,270
inject into memory all of their modules

801
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,429
so if they have a hash stump module

802
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:20,230
mimikatz module whatever have you

803
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,899
all of those are already stored so from

804
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:25,179
a defensive perspective it's easy on a

805
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:27,190
forensic investigation to go back and

806
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,780
see what capabilities they had available

807
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:32,589
to them now if it's done properly they

808
00:34:32,589 --> 00:34:35,020
will have multiple stages they will only

809
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,629
execute what they need at a given time

810
00:34:37,629 --> 00:34:40,449
so that they're not burning all of their

811
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:43,810
capabilities in one shot guys following

812
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:50,830
that all right so in summary there

813
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,109
before I show you guys our platform

814
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:56,379
really well what I proposed is putting

815
00:34:56,379 --> 00:34:59,890
the human and in an act in an offensive

816
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,830
type manner to provide defense allow the

817
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:05,430
human defender freedom of movement

818
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,380
inside your environment and give them

819
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,000
take their handcuffs off and let them

820
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,359
engage

821
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,570
all right give me one second

822
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:50,690
so what what I'm showing you here this

823
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,170
is route 9 B's version of a hunt

824
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,380
platform now there's as I mentioned

825
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,849
there's a plethora of capabilities out

826
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:02,599
there right that we've built our own but

827
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:05,059
you could use WMI you could use

828
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:07,069
Metasploit if you want really you could

829
00:36:07,069 --> 00:36:10,280
use any type of capability but I want to

830
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,839
walk you guys through the concept of a

831
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,400
hunt operation as I just kind of

832
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,010
described it so that you can see some of

833
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:20,500
the benefits so once I authenticate here

834
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,849
what we have is the way we've designed

835
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,920
it is we've given role-based access as

836
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,440
part of the platform so when any user

837
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,630
that ends up logging in they can have

838
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,609
individualized payloads so from a

839
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:33,500
training perspective what we do is I

840
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,690
have an apprentice journeyman master

841
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,730
level and then what we do is we allow

842
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,829
the apprentice maybe only one task to be

843
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:42,140
executed and then as they graduate

844
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,690
through their individual training plan

845
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,990
we can add additional capabilities we

846
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:50,150
work off of the concept of operations is

847
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,390
the way that we do it today so what an

848
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:56,599
operation is is it could be really could

849
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:58,400
be anything that you defined but I could

850
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,049
say I want to do a new operation and

851
00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:02,780
company X is that new operation and then

852
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,450
underneath company X I might have VLAN 1

853
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:08,690
through VLAN 1,000,001 and I I can now

854
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:11,990
create individual baselines as part of

855
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:14,030
those sub children operations and then

856
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,010
roll them back up so it allows for quick

857
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:18,770
comparison for the operator to identify

858
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,480
any anomalies that are inside their

859
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,609
environment we have a couple different

860
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:27,650
components here I've created a

861
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:30,170
countermeasures operation already you

862
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,839
have collections collections is exactly

863
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:34,790
that doing some form of collection

864
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:37,190
against the the endpoint that you want

865
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,770
to you want to target analysis is is

866
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:42,109
basically just rolling it all up for you

867
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:43,790
to find an anomaly quickly and then you

868
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,500
have your management things here

869
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,210
reporting and auditing every good

870
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:50,980
product needs a reporting tool

871
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,910
so inside collections here good it's big

872
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:00,030
up there inside collections here I can

873
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,980
go through and I can specify a delivery

874
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,440
mechanism to find targets however I want

875
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,380
so I could literally use nmap if I

876
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,790
wanted to find a targets list and then

877
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,040
populate targets that way we have one

878
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,320
built in or organizations can use

879
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,780
whatever capability they want to go and

880
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,750
find those similarly everything that we

881
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,850
deliver we call a payload so a payload

882
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,500
back to that stage the infrastructure

883
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,660
standpoint I talk through we shove a

884
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,580
stager over and then we directly inject

885
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,860
code into every machine to collect we

886
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,170
then exfil over an encrypted named pipe

887
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,750
back to our database and then we we

888
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,150
visualize that data we are acting like

889
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,630
the attacker inside of the environment

890
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,070
payloads could be both local and remote

891
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,860
so I can dump out a payload take it and

892
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,170
double-click it on an endpoint and get

893
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,780
the data or I can remotely deploy it and

894
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,000
so that I can go and pull back data sets

895
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,130
in that concept if I had if your

896
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,750
organization had at any home or

897
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,430
something like that we would just deploy

898
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,020
the payloads over top of what's already

899
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,660
been approved or similarly you can blend

900
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,150
in and use just WMI or win RM or

901
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,440
whatever whatever you want against

902
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,040
Windows machines you can add endpoints

903
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,620
as part of the environment so I'm not

904
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,910
going to give you guys everything in the

905
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,140
product here but you can add two end

906
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,270
points I can query domain controllers

907
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,660
and then populate a list of hosts that's

908
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,190
what you have here I can specify

909
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:28,580
credentials so this is called evil core

910
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:42,140
and then I can validate targets are

911
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,500
alive and so inside here what it's doing

912
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,960
is it's going to go through it'll tell

913
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,600
me whether or not I have any targets up

914
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,740
for a collection standpoint and then I

915
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,210
can go through and I can start to

916
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:59,270
specify as targets come up I can specify

917
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,880
the payload collection capabilities and

918
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,820
so these are all swappable so for

919
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,680
organizations that have their own d4

920
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,820
kits or their own incident response or

921
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:13,130
own collectors you roll those in and it

922
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,660
becomes a payload infrastructure that

923
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,370
gets delivered just in time for

924
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:21,260
execution it's literally a shopping cart

925
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:26,030
menu approach to deploying payloads and

926
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:30,290
pulling back data sets all data I'll say

927
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,730
from executed payload I did some

928
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,080
analytics here already

929
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,160
all data comes back into the analysis

930
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,740
engine and through this analytics engine

931
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,620
here we conduct a baseline so I can

932
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,560
build out I could take an NS r L image

933
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,270
essentially take NS RL and load that

934
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,370
into the database and then do

935
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:51,770
comparisons of hashes or file paths of

936
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,990
target operating systems what I'm

937
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,760
looking for in those environments is an

938
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,370
anomaly if I run a hunt operation

939
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,560
against a Windows machine today and then

940
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,710
I run it again tomorrow and solitaire is

941
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,160
up that's going to present an anomaly to

942
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,540
me or something that's different

943
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,700
similarly I can compare operations

944
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,410
against each other to say show me what's

945
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:15,620
different from from previous now as it

946
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,350
comes back into the database we made it

947
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:21,320
easy we put the virus total up here once

948
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,560
you click on a hash or similarly you can

949
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,120
consult the Oracle Google and all of

950
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,980
those are swappable everything in this

951
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,630
interface that I'm doing is a restful

952
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:35,840
api so to the automation to the folks

953
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,820
that love automation yes it can be

954
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,650
automated now as we go through one of

955
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,750
the big differentiators we have in our

956
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,900
product

957
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,570
is I have the ability to remotely deploy

958
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:51,990
a payload and parse memory live on the

959
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:54,900
system so I can see if someone did a DLL

960
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,540
inject on it on an operating system or

961
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,490
if they did a write process memory

962
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,470
technique using off you skated shellcode

963
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:04,530
similar to what Chinese a PT's do and so

964
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:07,260
inside here if I click on one of these

965
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:11,850
hosts I can actually say show me every

966
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:14,610
uh one second I actually clicked on the

967
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:23,790
house sorry so what I just did there is

968
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,320
I clicked on a specific box that I know

969
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,000
has malware because I deployed a malware

970
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,630
in there it's actually a Chinese situ

971
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,240
server that I have Kyle calling home do

972
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,520
a Chinese situ server what you have here

973
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,440
is you have the targets every time you

974
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,390
do a collection it gets a unique gooood

975
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,980
and then it comes back with the host

976
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,960
name now on the right hand side what I

977
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,630
said is go ahead and show me processes

978
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,210
that have anomalies so what we did is we

979
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,660
took the windows core we took linux

980
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,820
kernel's we went back and said if we

981
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,310
were going to gain execution what are

982
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,600
all the ways that we would gain

983
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,760
execution and then we built the product

984
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,550
to catch ourselves effectively and so

985
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,830
what you'll see here is in this

986
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:07,590
particular instance I can identify that

987
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:12,210
bandwidth L has the green checks means

988
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,220
an anomaly in each one of those

989
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,950
components so if you guys are wondering

990
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:19,440
well what does that consist of well if

991
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,510
you see the rwx component there that's

992
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:24,120
read write execute permissions in the in

993
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,150
the binary I also see that there's PE

994
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:29,850
portable executable format telling me

995
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:32,100
that there's a PE header residing inside

996
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,470
of memory so at this point now

997
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,960
effectively what I've been able to do is

998
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,810
do that in mass collection step that

999
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:42,780
first step identify an anomaly and that

1000
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,190
leads into an indicator of compromise

1001
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:47,910
which is what I just got to now now from

1002
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,920
here I can go into very targeted

1003
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,860
collection and go say I want to take a

1004
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,690
look or I want to do a forensic grab or

1005
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:56,820
I want to dump the virtual address space

1006
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,950
of this specific process and turn it

1007
00:43:58,950 --> 00:43:59,620
into

1008
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:02,020
traditional forensics and IR over the

1009
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:06,190
wire or I can go and engage I could kill

1010
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,620
the process in this case kill bandwidth

1011
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,380
l across the network or I could take a

1012
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,590
look and say what other what other

1013
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:16,990
machines in this operating environment

1014
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,420
have something similar and do a larger

1015
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,340
sweep of the target this is where it

1016
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,590
gets dictated based off of what each

1017
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:34,300
organization feels comfortable with give

1018
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,960
me one second

1019
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:58,430
so what I'm showing you right here is

1020
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:01,740
there was bandwidth L good it's nice and

1021
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,310
big up there

1022
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:05,610
there's bandwidth L that's the actual

1023
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:07,890
collection so it's showing me what was

1024
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:10,770
residing in memory at this specific time

1025
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:14,400
that I collected and so as I scrolled

1026
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,610
down here I can see that there's an MZ

1027
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:20,400
header with execute read/write

1028
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,440
permissions so for those of you that

1029
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,370
don't do live memory analysis in pretty

1030
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:29,250
much every case of a sophisticated and

1031
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,020
not nation-states sophisticated

1032
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,940
adversary which most of them are what

1033
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,050
they'll try to do is move themselves

1034
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:36,540
into memory and once they're in memory

1035
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,490
then they're able to bypass your current

1036
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:39,720
security products that are deployed

1037
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,730
you're persistent agents and it allows

1038
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:43,700
for them to maintain continuous access

1039
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,590
so what this is showing is that there's

1040
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,780
code sitting inside of memory at this

1041
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,080
point in time now if anyone's used

1042
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,660
volatility mal fine this is basically an

1043
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,340
apples to apples comparison to

1044
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,650
volatilities mal fine type functionality

1045
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:01,290
now from here I can dive in and I can go

1046
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:04,650
and kill that specific process or I can

1047
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:05,910
grep through memory and say show me

1048
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,890
everything that's in memory and then I

1049
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,330
can push that out across the enterprise

1050
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,730
looking for for hacker handles and

1051
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:12,990
things like that that are inside there

1052
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,900
so inside route 9b the way we define

1053
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,120
hunt operations I'm seeing I'm running

1054
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,440
out of time so the way we define hunt

1055
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,290
operations again is interactive

1056
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,870
operations putting a human back at the

1057
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:26,700
center using an agentless type

1058
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,790
capability to actively engage right and

1059
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:34,910
so this is where in my opinion all

1060
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:37,560
organizations need to move themselves or

1061
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,300
else they are just going to continue

1062
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,110
deploying static defenses and hoping for

1063
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:45,680
the best and we will never win that way

1064
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,510
so with that I'd like to see and I have

1065
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:49,950
five minutes left I'd like to open it up

1066
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:52,790
for our questions

1067
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:59,819
I think we have a couple
