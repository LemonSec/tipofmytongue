[Music]

2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,210
a topic that's near and dear to my heart

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,330
is national level search that's where I

4
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,609
most recently had come from before teen

5
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:26,130
IAM and over that time that I was there

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,029
for about seven years building out

7
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,579
capabilities adding new capabilities

8
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:36,270
really evolving what we did it's got me

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,309
started thinking you know well what's

10
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,020
the current state of the world with

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,850
other certs where have we gone and

12
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,870
hopefully we'll get into some discussion

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,190
about where we should go with that I'm

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,660
gonna let you guys introduce yourselves

15
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,570
how you want everyone to hear a

16
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,390
description of where you are currently

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,160
and then you know we'll get into the

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,640
questions so Luke oh thanks that's

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,220
what's on scripted so it was yes awesome

20
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,380
thanks thanks so sorry look so dick

21
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,869
Bordeaux and I'm currently I'm currently

22
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,840
a DM secure so what anybody has been in

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,060
military you know before here you know

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,400
the no DM secure the infamous compliance

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,400
people so that's me now and for the last

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,509
two months

27
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,430
just started before that I have a

28
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,159
similar background as the people I'm

29
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,720
supposed to disagree with here so what

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,159
was the chief of ops at sea sir a couple

31
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,490
of years ago I managed the IPC at Bell

32
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,890
Canada for a while and managed the IPC

33
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,470
at CSC for a while so that's my

34
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,670
background awesome and Patrick I could

35
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,860
afternoon it's I have to admit it's

36
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,420
really nice to see so many people in the

37
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,390
room stay on their own terms it has

38
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,340
nothing to do with an iPad draw at the

39
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,020
end of the day so kudos to you for

40
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,250
staying thank you

41
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,009
my name is Pat Patrick Lowe I'm with the

42
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,350
Canadian Centre for cybersecurity I'm

43
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,380
relatively new to the organization my

44
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,190
role there is to manage the

45
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,610
management practice within the center

46
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,850
and previous to to the center I was with

47
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:22,250
Cesar for roughly six years where see

48
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,680
circ is the National cert was a national

49
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,560
search prior to the center and before

50
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,360
that I ran an IPC in a government

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,430
department I've been with the government

52
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,840
for about 18 years my my how time flies

53
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,150
I like Chris this the search spirit the

54
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,740
principles of a search are near and dear

55
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,730
to my heart

56
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,440
working in a search has probably been

57
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,120
the most rewarding period of my career

58
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,120
and and hopefully I can provide some

59
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,740
insight today that will be useful to you

60
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,130
great

61
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,530
hi I'm Sasha I'm officially their pain

62
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:05,780
in their asses confirmed I use for those

63
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,310
are you saw my presentation I'm a threat

64
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,220
analyst by trade but I am also a

65
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,870
strategic adviser in the area of

66
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,600
incident management clearly one can't do

67
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,250
national level incident management

68
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,350
without a highly functional cert so I've

69
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,720
also had the benefit of being an adviser

70
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,480
both for standing up CCRC as well as

71
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,270
other national certs I have participated

72
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,270
in the standing up of internal Sox and

73
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,730
organisations going on 20-some odd years

74
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,739
prior to me going I want to get back

75
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:36,290
hands to keyboard but I continue to do

76
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,510
advice and guidance in that area which

77
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,370
is to say when I see stuff going

78
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,170
sideways I am a pain in the ass to

79
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,790
people and kick them and go can we

80
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,980
please solve this problem and can we

81
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,350
please get industry involved because we

82
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,300
have some great folks on that side of it

83
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,070
as well also confirmed with that much

84
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:01,160
tax or less I have to buy beer

85
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:07,519
afterwards generally alright let's get

86
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,989
into the questions let's get to the fun

87
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:11,300
stuff I'm actually gonna start with

88
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,510
Patrick for this one let's do this

89
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:18,500
so looking back maybe 10 maybe fuse five

90
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,930
years ago what was the functions of a

91
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,820
typical cert or what you could

92
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,680
reasonably expect from a national level

93
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:35,270
sir so five years five years ago I I

94
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,910
would say that just looking back at the

95
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,400
history of certs they kind of came about

96
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,740
in in the 90s early 90s late 80s and

97
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,410
they were primarily a community of

98
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,720
experts and they were they were

99
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,880
engineered and built based on on a

100
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,060
series of activities Morris worm early

101
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,360
days of cyber the glory days of cyber as

102
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,690
far as I'm concerned and and things kind

103
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,300
of evolved from there and we really

104
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,500
didn't see a shift away from that that

105
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,650
core community of practice until

106
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,710
probably the mid 2000s I would say in

107
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,160
the advent of of a shift in how cyber

108
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,789
was being employed for for different

109
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,650
motives one of them being financial the

110
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,280
other being a more strategic in nature

111
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,289
the early days of the certs for me and

112
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:33,470
my experience where it was largely a

113
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,889
coordination role making sure that when

114
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:38,690
folks needed help they had a national

115
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,580
entity a national point of contact to be

116
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,409
able to get the help that they needed in

117
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,030
terms of connecting with the right

118
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,190
organizations whether that be law

119
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,430
enforcement whether that be

120
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,430
international community so again a large

121
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,139
coordination function from a national

122
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:56,330
search perspective was something that we

123
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,759
did quite a bit of and and some of the

124
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,080
fundamentals were there as well

125
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,570
releasing advisories about about

126
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,419
critical vulnerabilities making sure

127
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:07,699
that whatever information we had to

128
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,199
share from a national perspective we

129
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,120
shared that that information so that

130
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,520
others could benefit from from the

131
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,970
experiences of victims or others others

132
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,870
in our constituency and and and again it

133
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,630
stayed that way until probably the last

134
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,139
five or six years and and we're seeing a

135
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:30,110
dynamic where where national centres are

136
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,969
being built Canada being one example but

137
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:34,279
we're not the first and that that's kind

138
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,930
of the timeline as I look back at my

139
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,490
career in the search community

140
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,040
in terms of where things have gone okay

141
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,580
Sasha from your perspective five 10

142
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,790
years ago looking at a national sir what

143
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,280
could you expect out of them in terms of

144
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,030
functions and services I think most of

145
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,880
them what did you tell me to do at the

146
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,350
time via trusted broker I'll be honest

147
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,240
we can talk about all sorts of fancy

148
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,880
functions that they're gonna do but a

149
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,440
national sir provides exactly one

150
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,220
function

151
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,150
they provide trust I might not be able

152
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,410
to trust every one of you in the room

153
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,870
but I trust them I'll give them my data

154
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,760
I'll allow them to anonymize that find

155
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,320
out the really key parts of it they are

156
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,600
my trusted authority as the National

157
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,420
cert in each of their roles they then

158
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,460
would build trust with each one of you I

159
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,890
don't have time to do that as an

160
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,170
industry representative I don't so they

161
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,670
were for me a trusted Authority and a

162
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:35,630
trusted broker my fear is that as we

163
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,730
evolve people forget that that they are

164
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,850
literally the trust brokers that's where

165
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,530
I saw them five years ago and I will

166
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,510
have you know that Canada was held up as

167
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,390
a model for being one of the best

168
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,370
national certs in terms of the model so

169
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,200
I applaud these two most people don't

170
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,210
realize what hard work they put into

171
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,940
building that and I'm not sucking up

172
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,440
they don't I don't know the beer right

173
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,530
now I just like watching the blanks so

174
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,050
yeah thanks a show helped a lot with

175
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,430
their connecting the dots there for sure

176
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,040
but but yeah so so historically certs

177
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,050
were you know a new s search you would

178
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,880
know about that so posting advisories

179
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,350
right that's what what the search was

180
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,380
for and then then people were like ah

181
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,150
this is useless just go straight to the

182
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,440
Cisco page that's where all the

183
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,970
vulnerability are go to the Microsoft

184
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,250
page that's where the the updates are so

185
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,870
why do we need a search for that well

186
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,030
you the thing that done on me is that

187
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,730
you actually need a trusted place to put

188
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,700
it up to tell you so that you can use it

189
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,010
as a the government is saying that this

190
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,780
is important and it helps people

191
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,090
convince their executive that they

192
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,400
should do something about it so so that

193
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,020
was a value that was unexpected at the

194
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,120
beginning so advisories and you know

195
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,100
saying this is a big thing posted on a

196
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,940
government sir

197
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,820
page or a national search Ric properly

198
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,640
recognized for that matter is a you know

199
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,410
serve that purpose it's the trusted

200
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,150
place where that you can point to to

201
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,270
blame that you need resources to fix it

202
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,680
as opposed to the two thousand other

203
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,960
things that that you also need to fix so

204
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,760
that was one thing then the other thing

205
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,360
that came up more and the nice in the

206
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,420
last like eight years was a notification

207
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,330
so you need a place where you can when

208
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,430
you find a dump of data of compromised

209
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,890
stuff that you can throw it over the

210
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,180
fence and they're gonna handle it and

211
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,430
they're gonna notify the fifteen

212
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,060
thousand victims that your data repo

213
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,670
keylogging files you ended up finding on

214
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,000
the Zeus C&C server somewhere that that

215
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,230
you know they're going to be handled

216
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,020
properly so notification at scale is a

217
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,990
service that the National cert you know

218
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,620
that the best national search do and and

219
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,200
should have done in the last five years

220
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,010
if if they didn't so so I think I think

221
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,020
we had that it's not it's not perfect

222
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,210
but those two things is what I saw

223
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,650
Nationals are doing and I think it's

224
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,830
still right to be I think you know

225
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,660
that's that's a core function that that

226
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,460
necessarily has to continue to exist but

227
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,910
you know over time we we see and

228
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,150
recognize other needs that come into

229
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,620
play for us cert it was a little bit by

230
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,540
accident so you assert many don't

231
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,450
recognize this the u.s. cert stands for

232
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,590
the United States

233
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,500
computer emergency readiness team they

234
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,090
are actually doesn't stand for a

235
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,550
response it was all about the function

236
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,010
of preparing people and arming him with

237
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,080
what they needed in that eventualities

238
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,610
of an incident fairly early on in my

239
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,400
time at us sir we actually had an

240
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,550
incident I was a bad government employee

241
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:51,410
I answered my phone at at late hours I

242
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,480
was actually in the office on a Thursday

243
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,770
night at about six o'clock and I

244
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,990
answered my phone happened to be the FBI

245
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,430
calling me and saying they were sending

246
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,670
a team to New York and some other

247
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,750
intelligence organizations were sending

248
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,740
a team to New York and

249
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,350
well you guys don't send teams anywhere

250
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,690
especially domestically what's going on

251
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:13,400
and it was we can't tell you you just

252
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,660
need to show up in New York and we'll

253
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,450
brief everyone in person in the morning

254
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,040
and that was the first time that US cert

255
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,840
actually ended up doing incident

256
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,420
response was around that that event that

257
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,510
occurred and I spent about six weeks in

258
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,030
New York City straddling December into

259
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:34,310
January 2010 into 2011 and that's how

260
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,660
you assert actually started doing

261
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,060
incident response was over that whole of

262
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,220
government multi-agency response out of

263
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,010
a major incident and we quickly realized

264
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,990
that we were gonna be doing this more

265
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,190
often you know success breeds more work

266
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,390
not necessarily more success but at

267
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,780
least more work and that's how we built

268
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,940
out the program we started from that one

269
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,700
event about four weeks after we put that

270
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,400
incident to bed the RSA intrusion

271
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,430
happened in 2011 so what we had already

272
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,140
quickly learned about multi-agency

273
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,720
response for the first thing was put

274
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,100
into play for the second and it's

275
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,030
snowballed from there

276
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,590
so Incident Response became a

277
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,830
cornerstone thing that we added to the

278
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,890
things that we did as us-cert plenty of

279
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,110
other services and things that we've

280
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,990
done since then indicator sharing and

281
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,630
facilitating direct sharing of

282
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,150
indicators between organizations has

283
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:33,320
played a part what other things have you

284
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,800
guys seen that have been added as as

285
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,880
services for your certs and

286
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:50,210
organizations go for it so the one

287
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,980
function that I love that our national

288
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,640
cert

289
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,140
see this is why we have Pat in the

290
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,840
middle the one service that I love that

291
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,210
our national cert is provided how many

292
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,620
of you have to deal with an incident

293
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,980
your organization pheromone hands yeah

294
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,160
lots of you now how many of you want to

295
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,480
guest you probably been dealing with the

296
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,260
exact same incident the function that a

297
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,150
national search should provide is

298
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,070
national mitigation

299
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,320
so much easier for us resource wise to

300
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,290
have a coordinated effort against that

301
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,470
particular attack than it is for 40

302
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,180
different organizations to do 40

303
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,710
different people on it we don't have the

304
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,270
time and the resources to do that and

305
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,970
when you can have a mitigation against a

306
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,880
DDoS a malware outbreak a spam run

307
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,190
that's coordinated by the National cert

308
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,250
that leverages trusted communities like

309
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,980
telcos and banks and other organizations

310
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,500
law enforcement that can then try and

311
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,990
respond to their 1% of the problem and

312
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,230
put that all together we can attack the

313
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,090
problem much more effectively than if we

314
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,710
each try and tackle it individually and

315
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,780
having them be the coordination function

316
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,480
for that you have no idea how many

317
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,910
threats have been mitigated because of

318
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,710
that function and I think more than

319
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,540
anything we need to continue to grow

320
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:17,100
that take let's keep the conversation go

321
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,810
up here well well if you can jot that

322
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:23,070
down though anything that's true and

323
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,750
that's kind of piggybacking on what you

324
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,760
said is a so one one service that has

325
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,600
definitely stepped up lately in national

326
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,490
search has been you know has been those

327
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,800
law enforcement cases has known those

328
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,250
national big national mitigations and

329
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,610
we've had I know that from a Canadian

330
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,940
perspective I think I think I was

331
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,490
amongst the I saw the beginning of that

332
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,420
and that continued that after but we did

333
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,950
some good good operations there with

334
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:56,580
RCMP with national security that you

335
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,920
know is transparent to many but we

336
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,900
scaled using the community in the trust

337
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,660
that had been built so that's that's a

338
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,430
wicked service that any national sir

339
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,220
needs to be able to do and and it's

340
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,990
within the lanes of everybody and so and

341
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,280
there's no money involved that's just

342
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,930
that's a funny thing about these big

343
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,120
mitigation and national level so making

344
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,540
IP addresses that are evil disappear or

345
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,540
putting pressure on an Aes to to drop

346
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,300
routes or you know sink holding domains

347
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,670
those kind of things there's typically

348
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,100
it's only trust it's only please do it

349
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,889
and you know

350
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:32,019
person will do it off their work our and

351
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:34,600
and volunteer firefighters yeah yeah

352
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,089
volunteer firefighters exactly and but

353
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:38,949
we've had tremendous success the problem

354
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:40,569
with this is scaling it and right now

355
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:42,309
the model the economics is not great on

356
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:43,959
that but national cert has a place and

357
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,189
our role to play on changing these

358
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:47,619
economics that I noticed you're jotting

359
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:49,689
down some notes so I think you have some

360
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:52,959
things one just doodling no actually

361
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,529
just a to expand on what Luke said in a

362
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:58,689
separate point after that when Luke says

363
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:01,869
community that that doesn't you've got a

364
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:04,179
couple of government folks here but that

365
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:07,019
doesn't necessarily mean government only

366
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:11,259
these these these collaborations on on a

367
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:13,839
given threat or a given issue are

368
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,839
largely non-government communities and

369
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,069
the importance of having someone from

370
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:22,749
the telcos someone from the bank's

371
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,519
someone from the AV or cybersecurity

372
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,109
community someone from government

373
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:27,759
someone from law enforcement involved in

374
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,549
some of these activities is is the key

375
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:33,009
to its success so so I just want to

376
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:34,569
emphasize the importance of the

377
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:36,449
community but also noting that

378
00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:38,829
government cannot do this by ourselves

379
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:42,100
and and and that's that's I guess my

380
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,610
point on that one just along a lines of

381
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,160
some of your experiences Chris I had a

382
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,839
similar experience that was a bit of a

383
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,809
changing moment for me at least and and

384
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:54,759
led to some of the kind of the bigger

385
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,649
picture issues that that that we're

386
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,769
starting to tackle today in July 2014 I

387
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,480
was sitting by the swimming pool having

388
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,179
some cold drinks like you I like

389
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:06,760
answering the phone and the weekends and

390
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,109
it was a large defense aerospace company

391
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,779
in the US and they had one of their

392
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:16,089
supply chain companies a Canadian

393
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,250
company in this case a company of 25

394
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,169
people that had basically experienced a

395
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:26,230
cyber security breach the actor in this

396
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,388
case was fairly sophisticated company of

397
00:17:28,388 --> 00:17:30,669
25 people building widgets for some

398
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:33,340
airplane somewhere is a relatively small

399
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,880
enterprise and the company themselves

400
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,460
didn't know what to do they didn't have

401
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,049
the capacity to be able to respond to

402
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:42,710
the issue they didn't have the money

403
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,320
to be able to afford a $250,000 ir

404
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,220
contract and we did our best in that

405
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,020
case and ended up getting them the help

406
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,529
they needed but this really raised this

407
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:58,669
raised an economic gap in in the way

408
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:01,179
that we do cyber and protect our

409
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:04,429
enterprises in Canada and probably

410
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:09,649
globally that coupled with this idea

411
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:11,870
that a company of 25 people is expected

412
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,149
to to prevent some of these issues from

413
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:16,850
occurring to them or happening to them I

414
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,570
think is is probably not a very fruitful

415
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,580
exercise and and we really need to think

416
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,240
rethink the way we tackle this issue and

417
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,940
have far more national level approaches

418
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,059
to these to these types of issues

419
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:36,080
sending them indicators all day long

420
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,789
just doesn't work it doesn't work and

421
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:40,250
we're appealing to large enterprises but

422
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,990
we need to think we need to think more

423
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,830
broadly about our strategies for one

424
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,630
second is that most of the bad actors

425
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,789
know this so they're targeting the

426
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:51,710
universities they're targeting the small

427
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,630
enterprises they're targeting this to

428
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,000
get into the bigger fish knowing that

429
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,350
there's a trusted connection going there

430
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,149
and that's where the that's an

431
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:00,980
invaluable service that national certs

432
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,710
can provide is that overload yeah

433
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,610
absolutely

434
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,659
it's funny in a separate conversation we

435
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:12,770
go into cyber risk and cyber insurance a

436
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,260
lot of larger organizations in terms of

437
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,990
managing their supply chain risks are

438
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,260
requiring indemnification from these

439
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,090
small companies if they if the larger

440
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,580
company has a breach it's not realistic

441
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,980
either and I've seen some large

442
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,500
companies demand that okay in the very

443
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,059
least you have to carry multi-million

444
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:36,470
dollar cyber insurance policies that may

445
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,429
not be viable either

446
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:42,260
based on you know the income that that

447
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,059
company has but at least they need to

448
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:46,250
have a skin in the game but on the other

449
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,110
side of that we do we need to provide

450
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,020
better guidance to these smaller

451
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,080
organizations to help them either secure

452
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,510
it themselves or find the resources

453
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,870
to do that security for them all you

454
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,600
catch your breath there's a no supply

455
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,490
chain as you know DMV is not at all

456
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,640
exposed to supply chain problems we

457
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,419
would never be a target I mean it starts

458
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,490
some some of the smaller company the

459
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,070
echo system out there starts with the in

460
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,530
France you silly dog so in the big

461
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,210
economic players they need to start you

462
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,350
know rolling in cybersecurity

463
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,179
requirements as part of their contracts

464
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:25,610
and and hopefully that percolates down

465
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,059
and and gets enforced to audit

466
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:30,410
appropriately so I really believe there

467
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,080
so if you if I buy planes from you know

468
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,240
a plane company that outsources their

469
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,309
landing gear to a Canadian company in

470
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:41,840
Quebec Montreal then they hopefully my

471
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,520
contract with them will percolate all

472
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,250
the way down and they will be forced to

473
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,890
pay or to to incentivize a smaller guy

474
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,860
to to reach out to to to bring up their

475
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,419
security to were to be able to comply

476
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,559
with the contract requirements so

477
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,780
there's a bit of that in there as well

478
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,910
and educate the people to do it Pat I

479
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,830
don't know if went back in the day if I

480
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,410
ever got a chance to tell you one of the

481
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,840
debates that we ended up having in

482
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,820
government is the role of government in

483
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,890
providing IR services I mean there's

484
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,590
stuff in the private sector it's not

485
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,390
usually cheap and for small

486
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,710
organizations it's particularly

487
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,590
problematic we ended up having to come

488
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,419
up with kind of rules of engagement when

489
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:23,840
does government jump in so a couple

490
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,030
factors came into play for us is it

491
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,130
private sector critical infrastructure

492
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,280
the answer is yes then probably

493
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,010
government has a role to play there in

494
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,919
that thing is it a small organization

495
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:39,110
that just financially doesn't have the

496
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:43,580
wherewithal to get those resources is it

497
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,790
a case where if government is involved

498
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,559
government has unique knowledge through

499
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,940
their reach back into the intelligence

500
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,190
and law enforcement community about that

501
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,390
threat so that they can help support or

502
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,640
is it a case where government may hope

503
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,030
to learn something from this victim that

504
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,160
they can then use to help that broader

505
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,990
community back to Sasha's point earlier

506
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,179
on about you know when you get when the

507
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:10,549
national level cert sees a problem

508
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:14,059
in one organization they hopefully are

509
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:16,160
recognizing that that is applicable to

510
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,110
many more in communicating out

511
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,510
appropriately to others in the community

512
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,580
so they can then defend themselves about

513
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,880
that new threat but yeah we actually

514
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,040
ended up having to come up with a gating

515
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,130
criteria when did we engage in a space

516
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,090
that arguably could be taken from

517
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:40,520
private sector resources yes it's you

518
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,380
know I have a huge discomfort with with

519
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,960
doing IR from a government perspective

520
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,549
there's very smart companies that do IR

521
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:49,070
right now so the role of government and

522
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,620
there shouldn't be to do IR should be to

523
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,590
maybe validate the IR qualification and

524
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,390
the trust of some of the IR offering out

525
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,679
there you know they don't want to have

526
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,700
the fake AV providing higher yes but to

527
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,440
find what you mean by IR versus incident

528
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,540
handling because there is exactly so the

529
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,809
coordination is if yeah exactly so

530
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:10,460
coordination definitely government

531
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,380
anchor of trust kind of thing but doing

532
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,080
on-site IR you know when the economics

533
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,760
of the the economics of it is is the

534
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:24,590
hard thing to address on the other hand

535
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,120
telling them here's a checklist that you

536
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,650
need to get your staff to run through

537
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,059
and you might want to look for point

538
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:30,559
eight point B and Point C there are a

539
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,720
lot of small organizations that need

540
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,309
that because even companies like myself

541
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:35,799
where you can do like stock in a box

542
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,210
okay

543
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,470
that's still out of the reach of many of

544
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,840
these small organizations so yes okay we

545
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,160
don't want government to say okay this

546
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,480
is how you configure it and this is how

547
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,880
you go and look at your log but go look

548
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,010
in your log for XY and Z and call me

549
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,240
back and I'll tell you and I'll give you

550
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,299
some help I do we might disagree on that

551
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:54,980
but I do feel that that is a critical

552
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,419
function of the national search yeah I

553
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:58,850
think providing the guidance of of these

554
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,470
are the things you should do is the bare

555
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:04,400
minimum but I do from my own experience

556
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,950
did encounter organizations that

557
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,150
arguably were pretty sizable that should

558
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,040
have had that reap type of resource in

559
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,080
fact by title they did have that

560
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,870
resource inside their company or agency

561
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,510
in some cases but the reality was very

562
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,179
different from that and in

563
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:24,149
terms of their capability in executing

564
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:27,039
but always it was very important for us

565
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,440
that we operated by vampire rules you

566
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,899
had to be invited in they had to ask for

567
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:34,629
that help in that moment and set the

568
00:24:34,629 --> 00:24:37,350
rules of what they wanted out of that

569
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,110
but every time I think they're always

570
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,119
and this is the healthy part government

571
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,360
should be asking is this an engagement

572
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,269
that they should be involved in and is

573
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:51,039
there a better resource out in the

574
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,450
private sector for that but there are

575
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,299
core things consistently that

576
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:58,149
coordination role that certs have to

577
00:24:58,149 --> 00:24:59,529
provide in all cases I think this is

578
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:01,929
going to vary between countries and and

579
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:06,039
and culture around that and where that

580
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,929
pushback is of you know suddenly you

581
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:10,779
have government agents on your network

582
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:12,549
in some ways

583
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:17,009
chris'll just i mean when it comes to ir

584
00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:18,970
there are many different strategies

585
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,759
around it the uk's got a list of

586
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:24,669
pre-qualified ir companies to avoid the

587
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:26,740
kind of things that sasha was pointing

588
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,899
to or luke was seeing about fake AV

589
00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:32,490
doing ir and we've seen cases where

590
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,629
we've dealt with companies have had

591
00:25:34,629 --> 00:25:37,330
significant compromises and we helped

592
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,179
them review kind of the the RFPs that

593
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:41,379
are being pitched to them to come on

594
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:42,909
site to be able to help them out and the

595
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:46,259
RFPs for a vulnerability assessment so

596
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:49,570
anyway the the strategy in the UK is is

597
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,249
an interesting one it still doesn't

598
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:54,570
resolve the economics issue and i think

599
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,909
my view the views expressed are those of

600
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:02,139
my own are there there are going to be

601
00:26:02,139 --> 00:26:04,869
cases based on on a rigid set of

602
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:08,529
criteria where it makes sense for at

603
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:11,559
least some form of physical support to

604
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:14,080
the organization or in combination with

605
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,470
with a response company in some way to

606
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,639
be able to help somebody through the

607
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:19,960
process of dealing with a major

608
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,669
compromise of their network yes what

609
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:23,470
boys onto your rules of engagement again

610
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,379
there's a place there's a balance the

611
00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:28,620
number of times that we went on site and

612
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,860
a big named ir company was already there

613
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,350
and we we end up working side by side

614
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,900
then the focus is a little bit different

615
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,750
it's but it is definitely more the

616
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,059
crisis management side of it and the ir

617
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:45,300
company is working on some more of the

618
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,000
the deep technical analysis in some

619
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,120
cases but it's not uncommon when

620
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,160
government does plug in and is asked in

621
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,200
that there already is a resource there

622
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,090
just a little bit of a different focus

623
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,800
and what's being brought to the table

624
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:04,020
are there any other functions or

625
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,750
services they're new that you've

626
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,580
seemingly sprung up in the last five

627
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,770
years that my coat my colleagues are

628
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:18,150
gonna disagree with me so the role that

629
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,410
i would like to see some more national

630
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,670
certs playing and the only one that I

631
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,440
see thus far is in the UK is public

632
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,890
policy this is going to be politically

633
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,450
incorrect we are breeding our own next

634
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,809
generation of hackers we don't teach

635
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:33,030
children how to use the Internet

636
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,770
properly and I mean ethically not

637
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,990
necessarily safely until they're in

638
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,110
grade eight or nine my son taught me how

639
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,420
to hack a Wi-Fi point at 6:00 he found

640
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,690
his first zero day at eight we teach

641
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,700
them to go online and play games they

642
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,440
watch YouTube videos please tell me

643
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,910
there is no parent in this room that

644
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,980
child has not gone and watched a gaming

645
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,160
video ok these gaming videos teach them

646
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,710
how to play their game video

647
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,670
fantastically it also teaches on how to

648
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,929
get more game credit where do you think

649
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,340
that game credit is coming from that is

650
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,530
the underground economy these children

651
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,240
then watch the game and credit video

652
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,130
which then leads them into hey let's

653
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,240
play with these other guys because

654
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,740
they're the elite crew on it I want to

655
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,540
get on their crew now you have one crew

656
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,920
playing against another crew when their

657
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,150
get pissed off with one another so they

658
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,040
start Daxing one another and they want

659
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,510
to have that server so they found this

660
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,250
new YouTube video that says hey this is

661
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,750
how I can get the server to myself

662
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,750
that's actually called a DDoS and then

663
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,760
in grade 8 they get to have their this

664
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,290
is how we get online we teach them how

665
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,360
to get on a safe on a school bus safely

666
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,300
at like 4 and yet we don't teach them

667
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,010
how to get into the dangerous parts of

668
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,929
the Internet until they're too old to be

669
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:39,150
able to convince we are literally giving

670
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,470
them the pathway to become cyber

671
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,660
criminals and they don't

672
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,450
no they're doing it I would love to see

673
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,280
national search start getting into

674
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,010
public policy about how can we create

675
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,440
programs working with banks so that it's

676
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,540
right at the ATM do you know where your

677
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,030
child is online today and you think I

678
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,400
would know the better than anybody else

679
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,840
do you know how many times I found my

680
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,520
son literally in the middle of

681
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,550
accidentally doing something insane like

682
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,590
I'm gonna go on paceman and find random

683
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:10,730
code to throw on my server and he

684
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,380
literally grew up with these to his

685
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:21,800
uncles okay problem one yeah I'll try

686
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,610
min on that one so I got a text message

687
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:30,700
you know uncle Chris hey how do I get a

688
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,920
VPN for my gaming like really why do you

689
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,480
want that what but tell me more and then

690
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,520
you start to find out that maybe he

691
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,520
ticked off someone and got booted from a

692
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,800
game and needs a new IP address okay

693
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,670
tell me more we're gonna talk about this

694
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,350
where who gave you the idea of going in

695
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,720
and VPN really tell me their names I

696
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,760
want to have a chat with them

697
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,210
yeah we're fooling ourselves if we don't

698
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:03,080
think and recognize that they're they're

699
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,820
gonna discover things and learn things

700
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,290
and if we're not doing it a little more

701
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:09,860
proactively ahead of time yeah they're

702
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,400
gonna go down some interesting paths

703
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,470
second poison talk with one another in

704
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,000
the gaming servers I had a conversation

705
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,860
with the head of the National cert at

706
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,480
one point trying to figure out why this

707
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,090
gaming crew was implanting things and

708
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,950
going like why if it's not actually this

709
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,540
person why is it this person he finally

710
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,890
got so pissed off because this was all

711
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,250
on audio like on speakerphone and he

712
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,380
came clean you guys are so old you're

713
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,570
pissing me off here's the URL and threw

714
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,060
at me literally a gaming forum where the

715
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,230
guys were arguing with each other and

716
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,700
they were having a hack off to see which

717
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,100
crew was a better hacker crew this is a

718
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,810
well known hacker crew this is what our

719
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,310
kids are sitting inside of because we

720
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,290
say oh yeah gaming is fun go play the

721
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,030
video game mom wants to have a break dad

722
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,710
wants to have a break go go play some

723
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,560
online video games so while this is

724
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,370
gonna take

725
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:59,750
of water my personal pet peeve is well

726
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:03,110
how hackers yeah but that's it like a

727
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,390
yeah those that have kids no no about

728
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:08,300
that like a mine did hire the bot to

729
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,370
give him like on a picture on Instagram

730
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,900
because he they had a competition of

731
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:16,250
what the most likes so brave new world

732
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,890
so the question is so nobody will

733
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:19,520
disagree

734
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,740
nobody will disagree on education cyber

735
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,660
education is a so right now you know

736
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,790
after you know the typical number of 1

737
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:29,120
million short and in in cyber security

738
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,100
professional right now so lots of jobs

739
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,929
opening and whatnot and we have lots of

740
00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:35,750
people here that you know for sure job

741
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,110
security forever as a result of this so

742
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,640
so yeah we absolutely need that the

743
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,470
question is is is the cert the right

744
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,179
place to be the lobbyist

745
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:47,720
for cybersecurity education from from

746
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,750
you know young age all the way to all

747
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,460
the way to professional grain and and

748
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,929
the answer is probably yes it probably

749
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:57,200
yes because we have search including

750
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,460
Enterprise Search have the most data to

751
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,380
back up the to back up there are the

752
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,770
arguments about the need so so yeah

753
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,330
absolutely with you on that and the the

754
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,309
cert has a role if not to write the

755
00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:12,110
policy to advocate for it and to put the

756
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,090
policy makers and alone for the the

757
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:16,910
lawmakers to to to put them forward ok a

758
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,860
smart person once told me that metrics

759
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,090
are the way to go to prove these things

760
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,590
and certs are the only ones that have

761
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:25,730
those and metrics lead to money that

762
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:29,000
they do alright so we do also have a lot

763
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,840
of cert organizations that have never

764
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,140
changed their model that are you know

765
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,740
still doing exactly what they did

766
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,059
10-15 years or whenever they were stood

767
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:44,210
up and not added any of these other

768
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,700
services are not pivoted and some of

769
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,940
them it may be a conscious decision is

770
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,400
there anything that you guys see is a

771
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,929
common trend there for those

772
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:58,010
organizations that is it politics lack

773
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:01,460
of remit to allow them to do it or

774
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,700
funding that it keeps them from shifting

775
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,190
or pivoting or is it just maybe because

776
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,120
of where they are

777
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,580
world there's there's no push for them

778
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,310
to adjust to a different world or they

779
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:17,180
realize why change a good thing I'll

780
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,930
just jump in and for a sec so so so I

781
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:24,200
know change I know change like at sea

782
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,000
circ for example they were you know in

783
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,950
2010 when I arrived there there was

784
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:33,350
seven people and and I think see Sir was

785
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:36,050
like 60 people at the creation at the

786
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,730
center so so there's been a bit of a

787
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,070
growth and and I know that the way we

788
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:43,760
help you know contribute to some bigger

789
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,140
picture there by the way

790
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,670
the way I contributed to it is to get

791
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,220
data again back to the metric to

792
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,960
demonstrate and then get funding and

793
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,120
then transform but the way I got this

794
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,570
data was with the trusted communities

795
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,230
that Sasha introduced me to so so once I

796
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,640
got the data I could make an argument

797
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,920
that you know these are the victims in

798
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,480
Canada and we need more investment and

799
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,690
that's grammar on it so I'd say that

800
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,020
certs that do not evolve are because

801
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,719
they're secluded and they refuse to or

802
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,270
they fail to realize the importance of

803
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,060
cybersecurity communities if you go to

804
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,010
first if you go to these various trust

805
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,500
group then then you know that you cannot

806
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,199
stay steady it's not a matter of funding

807
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,659
it's a matter of partnerships and it's

808
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:31,219
actually cheap to do to do stuff in

809
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,929
community and there's amazing things

810
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:35,330
that can be done so I'd say that so they

811
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,620
if they don't evolve because they're not

812
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,030
exposed to all the great things they

813
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:41,540
could do for cheap okay all right one

814
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:46,810
last one real quick so where should

815
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:50,060
certs be looking to extend themselves

816
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,920
and add to what they're they're offering

817
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,540
in the future maybe five years out from

818
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,280
now what should they be looking towards

819
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:07,120
for new demands on their resources I

820
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:14,620
think once that I your son

821
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,950
so so it's a question of scale it's a

822
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,560
question of moving on where the most

823
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,320
strategic place of influence is and

824
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,180
right now that strategic place is the

825
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,880
cloud so it's about it's about

826
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,520
intervening at the and building those

827
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,260
trust relationships with some of the

828
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,810
service providers out there so the telco

829
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,099
the banks and things like that those are

830
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:37,960
standard relationships and a national

831
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,140
certainty to have but but increasingly

832
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,900
it's gonna be those those this other

833
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,450
tier of service that is being added that

834
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,609
really brings the you know brings a

835
00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:51,010
corporate enterprise world into that

836
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:53,050
middle layer and the cloud and all these

837
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,839
service you know services figuring out

838
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,540
how to plug into and and gain some

839
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,190
insight and visibility in that world

840
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,200
it's additionally the infrastructure

841
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,880
that is getting added there that we all

842
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,410
depend on so we'll have to have those

843
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:08,710
relationship yeah so scalability was

844
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,589
exactly the point I was gonna make we're

845
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:13,810
seeing a huge and have been for the last

846
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,940
couple of years a huge transfer and

847
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:22,290
shift of e-commerce and IT to non

848
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:25,060
business owners relying on the cloud

849
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:29,320
relying on on very large organizations

850
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,109
to provision services to enable small to

851
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:33,820
medium enterprise and large enterprise

852
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,670
quite frankly the advantage we have

853
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,760
asserts to to have a Folsom and deep

854
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,910
relationship with these large tier

855
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:45,190
providers is it's it becomes a lot more

856
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,980
scalable dealing with with several

857
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,570
thousand small to medium enterprises

858
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:52,810
will is not is not scalable it's not

859
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,609
practical and it's quite frankly a

860
00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:56,410
disservice to the stakeholders of the

861
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,980
search so I think again we need to think

862
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,750
about how how things are moving from

863
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,280
from an economics and business

864
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,690
perspective and make sure that we're

865
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,599
being really smart about the

866
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,609
organizations that were we're engaging

867
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:12,910
with and the level and spectrum of

868
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,530
services that are being developed and

869
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,960
offered to our external stakeholders

870
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,500
should be such that where we have an eye

871
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,180
on kind of what our stakeholder

872
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,589
community looks like today and what it

873
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:24,940
will look like tomorrow and the

874
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,120
economics

875
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,340
Frank can we build can we build models

876
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,530
for shocks that are looking at the same

877
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,850
problem from multiple different

878
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,190
organizations it may be it's not at the

879
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,600
National cert level maybe it's at the

880
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,290
vendor level so I'm gonna put words in

881
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,380
your mouth Sasha from earlier one of

882
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,050
your comments can I sum it up as

883
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,020
whatever certs do in terms of change

884
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,450
don't do it for changes sake but really

885
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:53,210
think through why but and don't lose

886
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,850
sight of the core functions so we've

887
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,470
talked about some that say static and

888
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,060
apparently I differ and look on this

889
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,010
icing some national search that we stood

890
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,930
up perfectly and they have not changed

891
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:05,180
one iota in 15 years because their core

892
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,250
service fed to their national

893
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,500
requirements they didn't need to change

894
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,150
they realized changing would actually

895
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,190
break the good stuff that they've built

896
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,960
I've seen other organizations that have

897
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,820
changed and evolved because maybe

898
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,010
necessarily they started off very small

899
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,930
and they need to grow you just have to

900
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,580
be very conscious about what you are

901
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,770
changing for we're at an era where most

902
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,050
of the national certs have been around

903
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,270
for a while and anybody who's followed

904
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,440
security for a while we have this

905
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,240
wonderful tendency every four or five

906
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,160
years to break all the good stuff we

907
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,930
think did because we need to fix it and

908
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:39,290
we need to upgrade and I've seen us step

909
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,820
backwards and I've seen other countries

910
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,760
step backwards for because people get

911
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,020
the bright idea that we have to

912
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,030
rejuvenate without actually looking at

913
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,530
the are we gonna break it worse by doing

914
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,540
that so that's I'm not saying it's we

915
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,040
shouldn't change I'm just saying I've

916
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,160
seen it happen too many times I can see

917
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,570
some of my old bosses here why talk

918
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,430
about cars i TS and you have to have

919
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,320
been around in the community for a very

920
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,430
long time

921
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,410
you have to know dari to know we've come

922
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,450
a lot of different times we've come

923
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,920
right up to a really good thing and then

924
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,390
went oh somebody thought we have to

925
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,980
rejuvenate it all and we start all over

926
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,770
again we step back two years and the bad

927
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,390
guys take advantage of that and it just

928
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,070
kills me like we got to work together

929
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:19,220
because they all do excellent alright

930
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,710
let's turn it to the audience take some

931
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:25,880
questions just a hold on we'll come see

932
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,390
you with a mic

933
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:34,150
we'll see my question will be for the

934
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,759
whole panel asking we ask it in French

935
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:38,229
just to make sure that the essence go

936
00:39:38,229 --> 00:39:40,059
well and that we can lead you can

937
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:42,309
translate for the audience Yuri says all

938
00:39:42,309 --> 00:39:43,959
about being completes the qualification

939
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:45,549
on the National Survey of Sushi enough

940
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:51,999
to receive a key element so the question

941
00:39:51,999 --> 00:39:52,989
is what is the difference between a

942
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:55,630
national certainty and in an enterprise

943
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,609
search right and what are the different

944
00:39:57,609 --> 00:39:59,559
functions well you know what Enterprise

945
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:02,499
cert is is you have total visibility

946
00:40:02,499 --> 00:40:05,140
control and ownership you're the master

947
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,390
to take a sign fill job you're the

948
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:14,920
master of your domain but but obviously

949
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,749
national certs suffers from that

950
00:40:16,749 --> 00:40:19,930
visibility because obviously and then it

951
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,249
wouldn't scale otherwise so you have to

952
00:40:21,249 --> 00:40:22,959
think smartly about how you do it it's

953
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:24,819
very it's very much a coordination there

954
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:27,130
and relies on enterprise certs to share

955
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,709
Sun information in Timbits and to to

956
00:40:29,709 --> 00:40:32,170
make that nugget that is being shared

957
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,180
from an enterprise perspective a very

958
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,849
high value contribution to the rest of

959
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:39,549
the community so so it's you know that

960
00:40:39,549 --> 00:40:41,079
this is it this is the the big

961
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:44,170
difference and and you know in a

962
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,329
national search dream is to be an

963
00:40:46,329 --> 00:40:47,679
enterprise search like your national

964
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:50,109
cert is is basically a baby enterprise

965
00:40:50,109 --> 00:40:51,969
sir that really wish want to be an

966
00:40:51,969 --> 00:40:53,429
enterprise cert at the national level

967
00:40:53,429 --> 00:40:56,380
it's it's not a place that we should let

968
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,140
a national search either be very

969
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,239
important to draw the line because your

970
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:04,239
authority from a privacy perspective to

971
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:08,829
look at your data decrypt SSL go into

972
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:11,049
every computer for the purpose of

973
00:41:11,049 --> 00:41:13,859
defending your network that you can

974
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:16,539
national search is the cannot so so we

975
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:19,719
have to have the there's a line and then

976
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:22,630
that's the it doesn't mean thing and and

977
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,789
it's one constituent rather than

978
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:26,469
multiple constituents so the problem

979
00:41:26,469 --> 00:41:27,910
there's some negatives to an enterprise

980
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:31,059
sir having stood up many of them you

981
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:33,400
sometimes have a visibility if your IT

982
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,719
department and your secure department

983
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:38,529
play nice well together and the fact of

984
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:41,319
the matter is your view is your only

985
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:43,569
view you don't see what else is

986
00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:44,020
happening

987
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,190
most attacks you need to see

988
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,170
holistically across the globe what's

989
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:50,080
going on so there's there's a huge

990
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,180
difference between that I've stood in a

991
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,550
national in a enterprise sir personally

992
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,580
as a lead iron person and then I have to

993
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,140
always reach outside of the organization

994
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,330
to go help me help me understand this

995
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,680
what is the bigger picture here

996
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,480
so there's drawbacks to it as well just

997
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,310
really quickly I mean Luke touched on

998
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:12,430
this like what drives the business is

999
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:15,100
are very different things for an

1000
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,450
enterprise search it's largely the

1001
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,680
economics and the well-being of the

1002
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,740
business and for a national assert its

1003
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,690
it's a national perspective what's the

1004
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:26,230
right thing to do for Canada and that's

1005
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:28,030
actually we've been been really

1006
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,860
rewarding

1007
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:34,000
it's it's we we assist law enforcement

1008
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,610
by taking data blobs and notifying

1009
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:38,170
victims and helping them recover through

1010
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:40,720
that process while the the the police

1011
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,380
chase bad guys it's just the drivers are

1012
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,030
really really different from the

1013
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,830
national cert perspective and when I

1014
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:51,460
joined Caesar in in 2012 I was I was not

1015
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,930
expecting that actually it was it was

1016
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:55,030
really it was it was refreshing in many

1017
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,040
ways and scary because when you're used

1018
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,230
to having data in front of you and IDs

1019
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,940
systems and firewalls and logs and all

1020
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,830
that stuff

1021
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,300
operating at a layer of abstraction that

1022
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,970
is basically none of that and a heavy

1023
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:09,610
reliance upon voluntary incident

1024
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:11,800
reporting into the search absent other

1025
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,270
data sources that loop touched on

1026
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:15,540
earlier it's a pretty scary proposition

1027
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:19,750
but but it's it's it's an intellectual

1028
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,360
challenge that that's been that's been

1029
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,160
really really interesting for my career

1030
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,320
pretty frustrating for you to like

1031
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,020
company as we're talking about it the I

1032
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,880
when I was on the enterprise side and

1033
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,560
these two gentlemen were on the national

1034
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,990
side I go oh well why haven't you shut

1035
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,370
it down I just went in the thing in a

1036
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:38,800
winking incident done you guys would

1037
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,660
have to sit there and watch it and be so

1038
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,420
frustrated I would bet not being able to

1039
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,040
sometimes do anything about a problem

1040
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,100
that you could see there not nor should

1041
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,990
we sometimes because you break the stuff

1042
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:51,370
I'm sure you broke a few things in your

1043
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:54,240
enterprise so you would definitely

1044
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,130
indefinitely that no on the national

1045
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:58,530
level to break stuff and then you

1046
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:00,300
wouldn't know but but yeah but the point

1047
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,970
is that national and enterprise depend

1048
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:04,410
heavily on each other

1049
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:06,810
very good synergy there so tell me what

1050
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,370
you see on that indicator test that so

1051
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:09,990
we would do that test that idea

1052
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:11,550
signature that we got from a partner

1053
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,710
that's a false positive okay maybe it's

1054
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:15,780
not so good no Luke it's great brilliant

1055
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,630
awesome let's distribute this right that

1056
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:22,350
trust in relationships over time that's

1057
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:23,910
the big thing you learn when you jump

1058
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,190
into a national level cert is just

1059
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,170
building those relationships over time

1060
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:31,250
and I think that's also a key thing for

1061
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:34,020
that's important is the retention of

1062
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,930
people in the national level certs over

1063
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:38,580
time because it's building those

1064
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:42,120
relationships it is people even if it's

1065
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,190
organization organization whether we

1066
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,390
like it or not whether our senior

1067
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:48,120
leaders like it or not it is the people

1068
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,220
underneath that that glue all that

1069
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,810
together and if we don't retain the

1070
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:53,930
right people for long periods of time

1071
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:57,060
you'll lose a lot of momentum with that

1072
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,680
let's jump to another question yeah we

1073
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,150
have a former colleague that would like

1074
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:02,940
to ask a question I was I wasn't going

1075
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,650
to give that full disclosure but I used

1076
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:08,130
to be in C circ you've your forgiveness

1077
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:12,840
you've spoken about the importance of

1078
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,730
trust relationships and communities of

1079
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:17,130
interest and there are limitations on

1080
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,720
how far you can you can take that for

1081
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,400
all the reasons you guys have talked

1082
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,440
about and also the problem of

1083
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,530
scalability one area you haven't talked

1084
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:29,610
about is the critical infrastructure so

1085
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:32,160
there's no economic incentive for

1086
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,320
anybody except government to look at

1087
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,030
critical infrastructure and make sure

1088
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:37,800
critical infrastructure is maintained

1089
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,210
for the common good

1090
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:41,940
how do you see national certs playing a

1091
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,490
role on that or is that legislation or

1092
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:48,049
how do you see that being addressed

1093
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,600
I'm a DND

1094
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,589
guy so

1095
00:45:56,059 --> 00:45:58,410
that was a very elegant I wasn't

1096
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:03,690
critical so I would argue that as we

1097
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:06,119
look back through through through the

1098
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:07,890
the evolution of our search in Canada I

1099
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,210
would say that the sir displayed a

1100
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:10,650
fairly active role with critical

1101
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:12,210
infrastructure in Canada

1102
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,339
whatever critical infrastructure means I

1103
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:15,420
mean there are some fairly broad

1104
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,650
definitions of what's what CI is but but

1105
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:24,180
they're equally is important to us as as

1106
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,240
the government of Canada's network there

1107
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,640
are if the grid goes down and in Ontario

1108
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,369
then then that's that's probably going

1109
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:33,900
to be of interest of us to us

1110
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,059
particularly if there's a if there's a

1111
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:39,770
cyber component to it so III think

1112
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:42,900
critical infrastructure is absolutely at

1113
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,359
the core of of what we're trying to

1114
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,550
achieve within the centre and has been

1115
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,740
at the core of the National cert at

1116
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,680
least to to institute those

1117
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,589
relationships to to offer programs and

1118
00:46:55,589 --> 00:46:58,170
services to that community to the best

1119
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:03,690
to the best we could and yeah I'm not

1120
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,520
sure has anything more on that I was

1121
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,579
gonna say the the con op for CCRC the

1122
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:10,440
National cert when it was stood up it

1123
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,180
specifically stated that critical

1124
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,819
infrastructure was a constituency so it

1125
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:17,640
isn't it's codified for your support of

1126
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:22,349
them all of jump in so so critical

1127
00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:24,540
infrastructure in Canada that's what

1128
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:28,069
mostly I think mostly publicly owned

1129
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:31,770
provincial some federal the big ones

1130
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:33,510
like the bank and the telcos as private

1131
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:35,730
but really it's like charter you know

1132
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,530
Steven Chester didn't in the federal law

1133
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,630
some some somehow and CRT season there

1134
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:43,020
so so I guess the point is that is that

1135
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,480
for the public side municipalities water

1136
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,980
stuff like that they are not subjected

1137
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:51,930
to any compliance regime none so at Bell

1138
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:54,359
had like PCI had socks on my back all

1139
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:55,829
the time there was for it so at least

1140
00:47:55,829 --> 00:47:57,960
there was a some kind of incentive that

1141
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,420
if you don't invest in your car did you

1142
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,799
know PC our infrastructure to do some

1143
00:48:01,799 --> 00:48:03,059
pin testing at some point you're gonna

1144
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:04,589
be fine millions of dollars we don't

1145
00:48:04,589 --> 00:48:07,770
have that for water or electricity you

1146
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:08,230
know

1147
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:11,320
that we rely on so so that's a place

1148
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,800
that's a place we need some kind of the

1149
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,630
third party audit regime to make sure

1150
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,820
that and penalties and some but on

1151
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,020
public it's kind of hard to have those

1152
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,730
penalties but we somehow will have to

1153
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,680
have a law that will that will force

1154
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,780
some people to invest because what we

1155
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,430
what we see is that it's a it's a cost

1156
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:28,600
security is a cost we don't see

1157
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,270
investment a net still today despite how

1158
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:32,770
many years we've been talking about it

1159
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:35,380
and despite having all these stories

1160
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,350
week after week after week of people

1161
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,390
getting compromised I think when

1162
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:42,520
liability starts getting attached to it

1163
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,380
I mean real liability especially when

1164
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,270
organizations are gonna be liable for

1165
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:47,590
attacks that are bounced off of them

1166
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:49,450
we're gonna see maybe a slight shift in

1167
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:53,590
that you're saying there's a there's

1168
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:54,790
regulations that are coming into place

1169
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:56,530
at least in the US that are saying if an

1170
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:58,330
attack bounces off your network you can

1171
00:48:58,330 --> 00:48:59,290
be liable for that

1172
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:02,020
o Yaran all that kind of job exactly I

1173
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,030
think scurrying company but what's the

1174
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:05,500
equivalent for the public service so

1175
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,760
that's that's me

1176
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,369
to me that's the big issue right

1177
00:49:08,369 --> 00:49:11,470
government needs to be part of that and

1178
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:13,420
of municipalities provincial and like

1179
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,940
the health system is it's always you

1180
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,040
know you have the in the US right you

1181
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:22,300
have the legal the phys mod a the yeah

1182
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,550
we have a number of different regimes

1183
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:27,609
and also gap there we do have some

1184
00:49:27,609 --> 00:49:30,700
differences it's a mix of public and

1185
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,450
private for utilities water tends to be

1186
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:37,480
more of a public authority in a town or

1187
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,140
county level electricity however tends

1188
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:44,050
to be a lot of private enterprise so

1189
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:46,930
it's a mix of those things what we did

1190
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:50,250
in the US where it made sense is per

1191
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:53,950
critical infrastructure vertical we try

1192
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,290
to encourage the creation of information

1193
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:59,520
sharing and analysis centers ice-axe

1194
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,619
basically self-help organizations for

1195
00:50:02,619 --> 00:50:05,230
each of those industry verticals so that

1196
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:06,850
they can provide some amount of self

1197
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:10,330
help they also become a way of scaling

1198
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:12,400
the information out because sometimes

1199
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,740
you can't reach and touch every element

1200
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:17,020
of a given sector you may not know all

1201
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,910
of the players in that sector at all

1202
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:21,910
times but that industry association

1203
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:25,540
or group ideally does know all of their

1204
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,100
members and they know how to reach them

1205
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,840
so if you distribute information out

1206
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,840
they can get it out to all the rest that

1207
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,480
definitely helped us to scale out better

1208
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,230
and start to get industry specific

1209
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:40,240
guidance and help to them to learn what

1210
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,440
they needed to do better in their sector

1211
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,090
we have a question from cow in the front

1212
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:48,070
then we'll move back here okay so

1213
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:49,810
touching on some of the earlier

1214
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:51,820
discussion there are millions of

1215
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:53,740
computers out there owned by homeowners

1216
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,750
individual citizens and everything many

1217
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,880
which may be compromised acting in a

1218
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,640
botnet what is the role or is a role for

1219
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,830
the desert working with these

1220
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:05,230
individuals or with their eyes peas

1221
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,240
narrating to really address those issues

1222
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,340
and help eliminate the botnets and

1223
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,600
everything that are affecting the rest

1224
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,530
of your infrastructure

1225
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:14,770
I have a question kal do we put police

1226
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:15,970
officers on every door and every

1227
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:20,470
firefighter on every door no you come on

1228
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:22,330
today you come on there's an indication

1229
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:24,670
of but that's not true that's that's

1230
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:25,810
kind of the point that I'm trying to get

1231
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:27,190
we can't put the government on the hook

1232
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:28,900
for absolutely everything if you have a

1233
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:29,980
small fender bender

1234
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:32,740
the police don't show up and I'm not

1235
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,090
saying this facetiously I'm just saying

1236
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:37,180
people can't expect a national search to

1237
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,970
solve every single problem it I give the

1238
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:41,590
analogy that we do not put a firefighter

1239
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:43,270
and a police officer on every single

1240
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:45,430
doorstep because we simply can't we

1241
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:47,350
don't try to go to that level we turn

1242
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:48,940
around and say you need to be somewhat

1243
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,610
proactive on it I think doing public

1244
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:53,590
policy to go your machine could be doing

1245
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:55,660
part of it but to help every individual

1246
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,240
Canadian that's that's thing the same is

1247
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,890
we're gonna have somebody standing there

1248
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:01,690
protecting because they've had a little

1249
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:03,220
grease fire in their kitchen like not

1250
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,840
advocating that they help every

1251
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,430
individual I'm asking what their role

1252
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:08,320
would be in dealing with these types of

1253
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,790
incidents whether it's working with the

1254
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:12,490
ISPs to make sure that they help the

1255
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:14,800
individuals not just cut them off off

1256
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,450
the network because they're a botnet and

1257
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,040
that's the end of it and they don't know

1258
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,560
why they were cut off their networks so

1259
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,450
maybe I'll just jump in really quick is

1260
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:24,490
there a role absolutely and national

1261
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:26,050
certs have been playing a role that role

1262
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:30,670
for for many years and and to the to the

1263
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:32,290
data question or the data point that was

1264
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:33,460
made earlier about about getting

1265
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,410
information

1266
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:36,630
and not being an enterprise search

1267
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:37,950
that's the kind of information that

1268
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:40,010
certs get on a regular basis globally

1269
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:43,500
and what certs do with that is they

1270
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,390
carve it up and they send it to the

1271
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:47,069
organization that happens to own the IP

1272
00:52:47,069 --> 00:52:49,559
space and in many cases that is a home

1273
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:53,430
user the challenge is how do you explain

1274
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:56,609
to my mother who calls me at least once

1275
00:52:56,609 --> 00:52:58,260
a week and says I got another call about

1276
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:02,849
from CRA or well maybe not anymore or I

1277
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:05,010
got this so so there is there is there

1278
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:06,720
is a bit of a gap there in terms of

1279
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,720
fully addressing those issues but

1280
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,369
national certs absolutely play a role

1281
00:53:11,369 --> 00:53:14,309
there they also play a role in and and I

1282
00:53:14,309 --> 00:53:16,589
think it's incumbent upon us as national

1283
00:53:16,589 --> 00:53:18,480
sir people is to inform the policy

1284
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,400
makers the communications folks that

1285
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,380
aren't technical about the issues that

1286
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,240
we're seeing so that they can developed

1287
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,099
user level guidance something that's

1288
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:27,900
consumable by the general public about

1289
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,210
these types of issues about not clicking

1290
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,880
on a link on an unsolicited link email

1291
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,920
about about making sure that their

1292
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,359
computer is connected to the update

1293
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:39,029
ecosystem that exists those are the two

1294
00:53:39,029 --> 00:53:42,359
primary roles we've tried to play at sea

1295
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:44,039
circ and will continue to play through

1296
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:46,230
it at the at the cyber center at least

1297
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:49,710
in my view yeah so I've given a lot of

1298
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:52,349
thought to that when I was in national

1299
00:53:52,349 --> 00:53:55,349
cert and in receiving like the 20,000

1300
00:53:55,349 --> 00:53:58,170
Canadian IP address infected infected

1301
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:01,650
every every day half of them being

1302
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:05,130
configure so so we so we know that and

1303
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:07,890
so what's the role so the solution to

1304
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:09,720
that so some US ISPs have done some

1305
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,480
amazing job right wall garden so at

1306
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,450
scale on thousands and thousands of

1307
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:17,069
customers so essentially gets redirect

1308
00:54:17,069 --> 00:54:18,990
you know you go to browse from home and

1309
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:20,279
then you get their redirected

1310
00:54:20,279 --> 00:54:22,710
temporarily to a site that tells you by

1311
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:25,470
the way you're owned and here's the site

1312
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,289
is here's the advice from your national

1313
00:54:28,289 --> 00:54:30,450
cert now the question is how does that

1314
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:33,180
differ from no fake AV you know there's

1315
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,039
a bit of but if it's implemented at the

1316
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:37,079
telco level the wall garden then there's

1317
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:38,640
I think there's a scalable way of

1318
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,440
notifying people and giving them ways of

1319
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,569
of cleaning themselves and potentially

1320
00:54:42,569 --> 00:54:44,930
mitigating it this way so at scale so

1321
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:47,520
there there's technical challenges and

1322
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,030
there obviously

1323
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:50,890
but I think there's a lot of potential

1324
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:52,390
there and having that trust relationship

1325
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:54,280
between the telco and you know the

1326
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,640
service provider that is and the

1327
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,840
international cert as the authority

1328
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,190
supporting it so we did something like

1329
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:03,130
that with DNS changer with Sheila would

1330
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:05,619
that see a couple of years ago where we

1331
00:55:05,619 --> 00:55:07,360
provided a page for people to test their

1332
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,310
DNS and if they were infected and we're

1333
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:11,830
telling them how to how to go and

1334
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:13,950
mitigate themselves so I think this

1335
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:16,030
should mention this is how Luke became

1336
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:18,700
my boss right the first time because he

1337
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,110
said the exact same thing we did now

1338
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:22,090
it's we're gonna why don't you guys as

1339
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:24,369
ISPs try and do more about this when

1340
00:55:24,369 --> 00:55:26,140
Luke timely goes there's technical

1341
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,780
issues I know the ISPs that have put

1342
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,130
this in they designed it from the

1343
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:33,280
beginning it is significantly harder to

1344
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,960
do that mitigation than one would think

1345
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,240
and when Luke said oh you should do this

1346
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,830
I'm like fantastic come over be my boss

1347
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:41,140
show me how it's done do you want to

1348
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:42,550
talk now about the technical how hard it

1349
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:45,520
is we have time for one last question

1350
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,170
[Laughter]

1351
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:51,520
any homeowner who doesn't have any

1352
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,770
skills or knowledge or even knowledge

1353
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:55,240
that they're infected or that they're

1354
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,130
compromised and acting as a botnet to do

1355
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:58,450
anything about it so that's why I was

1356
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:00,520
wondering what kind of role you know the

1357
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,880
search the ISPs and everything really in

1358
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,140
identifying that they're infected that

1359
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:07,030
they have an issue or something because

1360
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,250
user won't get that usually it's gonna

1361
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:11,950
come in the form of large-scale botnet

1362
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:14,590
takedowns where some researchers and

1363
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:16,869
others have found that the long list of

1364
00:56:16,869 --> 00:56:19,180
compromised systems get it out to the

1365
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,850
appropriate national cert that oversees

1366
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:24,040
that country they then break it up into

1367
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,450
the smaller chunks get it to the right

1368
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:28,420
ISP and then on the d-day when when the

1369
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,820
disconnect is gonna happen have also

1370
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,530
coordinated not just with the local AI

1371
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:34,810
or the ISPs in that country but the

1372
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:36,940
antivirus providers to provide a one-off

1373
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:39,130
scanner that it's going to clean that

1374
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,890
particular thing now when it comes to

1375
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:44,710
the various random infections and other

1376
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:47,560
things when you have a breakdown in your

1377
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,050
car we don't expect you to know how to

1378
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:51,880
fix it we expect that you're gonna take

1379
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,220
it to the mechanic down the road and pay

1380
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,740
for your own repairs as needed if your

1381
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,140
computer has a breakdown sometimes

1382
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:02,040
that's gonna be the same thing

1383
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,440
there are local resources for do it

1384
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,240
people just don't necessarily like to

1385
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,370
pay or recognize that they have a

1386
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:11,130
responsibility in it themselves thank

1387
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:12,540
you Chris I want to move to just one

1388
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:19,530
last question the topic of cloud came up

1389
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:21,480
because more and more we're finding our

1390
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,380
data is transiting and being stored

1391
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:28,110
outside of one country's borders any

1392
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:31,260
comments from the panel as to the

1393
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,270
current state of international

1394
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:35,910
cooperation amongst national certs I

1395
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:38,730
know we have first and all and how

1396
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:41,130
better to work between national certs

1397
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:44,430
that might be at different capability

1398
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:48,300
and different maturity levels wants to

1399
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:54,360
take this one all right so I'll address

1400
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,130
the kind of the natural certain angle to

1401
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:59,190
your question if that's okay so national

1402
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:02,400
certs meet face to face annually not

1403
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,480
only through first through other

1404
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,360
mechanisms there are regional

1405
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,860
associations as well whether it be AP

1406
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:11,220
cert whether it be other other regional

1407
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,110
search organizations that bring certs

1408
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:16,650
together to to discuss these issues to

1409
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:18,240
discuss better ways of sharing

1410
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,740
information amongst themselves to

1411
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:22,500
address cloud issues amongst others and

1412
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,110
strategies to - how to deal with cloud

1413
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:30,840
and and secure the cloud and this this

1414
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,940
happens and has been going on for quite

1415
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:37,200
some time recognizing and and to your

1416
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,120
point is that the the level of maturity

1417
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,430
and capability across a lot of these

1418
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:45,630
certs varies extensively there are a

1419
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:48,540
number of leaders in in this space that

1420
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:51,840
are trying to or investing a lot in

1421
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,400
capacity building for some of these

1422
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,120
certs the Australians in particular

1423
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,700
along with the Kiwis are investing a

1424
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,650
quite a significant amount of resources

1425
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:06,750
towards building asia-pacific certs

1426
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,340
within the regions so that they can

1427
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,170
bring up their games so that they can

1428
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:11,400
have a bit more of an intelligent

1429
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,260
discussion with them about these these

1430
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:13,990
these

1431
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:17,920
larger scale issues so I that's that's

1432
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,050
kind of where I see things going in the

1433
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:21,580
search space on that yeah you actually

1434
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:24,100
you hit exactly where I was gonna go the

1435
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,980
the regional certs which are a

1436
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,140
conglomeration of all of the national

1437
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:32,290
level certs in a given region ap cert oh

1438
00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:35,230
I see cert the Organization for as long

1439
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:38,710
cooperation and others they play a role

1440
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:41,619
in kind of helping do capacity building

1441
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:44,340
for the individual national level certs

1442
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:49,720
yeah so so it's in it's very impressive

1443
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,970
the number of connected connections that

1444
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:55,240
you can get in you know in a in a given

1445
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,730
country for example I had to to do it

1446
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:59,680
take down a flashback a couple of years

1447
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,410
ago working a small group of security

1448
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:03,880
professionals there and I was in charge

1449
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:07,420
of sync holding out of the DGA dot k

1450
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:11,080
said that Kazakhstan well you know so

1451
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,780
you think I could turn to the Kazakhstan

1452
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,610
cert and ask them to think hold those

1453
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:17,200
domains and you know there was not a

1454
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,380
point of contact for the Kazakhstan cert

1455
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:23,200
but the dot K said TLD relationship in

1456
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,720
the DNS community we did have that

1457
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,390
contact and so there's ramification

1458
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:31,750
between ISPs and sometimes it's I don't

1459
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:33,940
have the ISP contact for Kazakhstan but

1460
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:37,150
I have the upstream with bgp contact and

1461
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:39,130
maybe it's all they're all going to I

1462
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:40,780
don't know a buddy that like Cox

1463
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,520
communication or whatever so then you

1464
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,980
put pressure from that side so so it's

1465
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:47,350
it's a multiple angle perspective and

1466
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:48,730
the community is large enough there's

1467
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:49,900
enough it could have a critical mass

1468
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,430
there that you can actually reach and

1469
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:53,680
put pressure at the right place if you

1470
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,930
