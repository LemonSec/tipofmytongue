[Music]

2
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,910
and thank you all for coming

3
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,000
I bounce around a lot and so I'm gonna

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,769
try not to you know screech you out with

5
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,150
the microphone or anything along those

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,490
lines I hope you all have coffee since

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,590
we're following right after lunchtime

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,330
and there's a lot of stats I'm gonna be

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,769
throwing at you so snoring would be

10
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,550
appreciated if it came to a minimum so

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,980
who am i some of you know me some of you

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,620
don't it kind of depends on where you

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,739
know me from I did protocol analysis for

14
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,300
a very long time with threat risk

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,510
assessment with a good chunk of you I

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,309
did incident handling for another 10

17
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:52,140
years after that and throughout all of

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,020
that I've studied malware I've managed

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,129
to cover a whole bunch of different

20
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:58,469
organizations but ultimately I ended up

21
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,719
landing at a company that kind of fit my

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,969
goal of trying to get the bad guys and I

23
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,049
continued that mission to this day why

24
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,270
did I pick this topic cuz I want to tell

25
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,930
you a story

26
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,110
I presented kind of this topic three

27
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,580
years ago would you believe it end up

28
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,470
becoming my number one thing that people

29
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,930
were asking me about we always and my

30
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,360
company is the worst for this also we

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,130
see all sorts of wonderful reports the

32
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,470
North American report we're just like

33
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,150
the Americans right like our threat

34
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,530
landscape is going to be exactly the

35
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,380
same as theirs I have nothing against

36
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,090
the US it's just our threat environment

37
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,430
is so different so everybody keeps

38
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,070
asking me could you write more on this

39
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,409
and so every couple of months I produce

40
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,240
us I am from Ottawa if you happen to be

41
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,799
from Ottawa and you want stats by all

42
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,149
means reach out to me I'm happy to

43
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,600
generate them but what I want to talk to

44
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,740
you today about is a story it's a story

45
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,470
about how we caused their own problems

46
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,899
how the bad guys see all of our holes

47
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,640
that we're doing and how they take

48
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,159
advantage of it and that's kind of all

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,560
in the context of Canada so I hope

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,939
you'll bear with me so I can tell you a

51
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,580
little bit about how I see Canada and

52
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,470
our landscape and why it's happening and

53
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,819
maybe you can help me fix it

54
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:15,870
so what are some of the things I've had

55
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,879
to deal with over the years I get to

56
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,170
deal with law enforcement a lot because

57
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,750
like I said I really really disliked

58
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,299
about guys so these days I get to work

59
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:26,579
with these three organizations as I find

60
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,200
bad stuff I hand it up to them and go

61
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,750
please take care of these and some of

62
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,190
the original cases I've had to deal with

63
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,709
are ones along these lines where I'm

64
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,090
just going can somebody please take care

65
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,040
of this problem that last one was

66
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,709
actually my primary case that I got to

67
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:43,319
first work with the RCMP a mission that

68
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,599
I continued on today and trying to help

69
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,329
build out the cyber unit and just to

70
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:49,739
make sure I know traditionally we

71
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,900
haven't had a lot of support from the

72
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,720
law enforcement in Canada I'd like to be

73
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,340
the first one to advocate no they did

74
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,629
not pay me for this to say they are

75
00:02:57,629 --> 00:02:59,310
actually getting better when that unit

76
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,440
comes in I can't wait to see what damage

77
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,730
we can do to the bad guys because we

78
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,829
have some of the best security folks

79
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:06,420
here in Canada bar none for any other

80
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,440
country so I can't wait for that day and

81
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,889
why did I land a trend I am very very

82
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:16,470
lucky I am working for a company who's

83
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,590
done security as long as I have and they

84
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,780
are there ahead of the curve most of the

85
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,069
time when it comes to security threats

86
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,760
it's a little annoying we pay 30 people

87
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,440
to basically think about where is the

88
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,120
next evolution and technology and then

89
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,459
create a solution to be ahead of it and

90
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,980
I is a Dannic data analyst then get all

91
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,449
of that fund data to take a look at

92
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,010
after we've put those signatures in to

93
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,650
go huh what are they doing now

94
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,910
so things like getting ahead of the

95
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,590
curve of email scanners and ransomware

96
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,660
and stuff and they very much believe in

97
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,220
research which is how I managed to go

98
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,560
from an IRA job to a pure research job

99
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,959
and we have positions all over the globe

100
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,000
which is one advantage you're gonna hear

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,879
me talking about Canada only but we're

102
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,290
lucky and the fact that I get data

103
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,909
sensors from kind of all over the place

104
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:02,430
and again as a data analyst I love being

105
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,109
able to see all sorts of different

106
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:06,750
traffic so those are the things that I'm

107
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,159
using on and this is my profund tree

108
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,449
we're wonderful slide we have research

109
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:15,750
centers all over the place so my next

110
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,630
step you all understand what the

111
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,970
internet is right

112
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,640
my favorite talk that I give and this

113
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,620
actually is a whole talk I just gave it

114
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,790
first but I'm gonna condense it into

115
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,760
three slides I even talked to security

116
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,880
professionals and I know that nobody in

117
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,340
this room thinks that this is how data

118
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,990
goes across the internet it does not go

119
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,690
by pixie dust and magic fairies between

120
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,490
me and you right like it bounces all

121
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,290
over the world to get to where you're

122
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,560
landing it follows more of a migration

123
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,610
path like this right we're playing pong

124
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,860
across the internet and trust me this

125
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,330
gets to where the bad guys are going

126
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,130
would any of you say that you would have

127
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,840
believed that that is the Canadian

128
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,530
Internet

129
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,560
I need a whole project this year because

130
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,440
I wanted to see we keep talking about

131
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,780
the Internet the internet the Internet

132
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,310
well I finally got to the gray hair

133
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,930
stage where I went I want to know what

134
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:13,820
that is

135
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,060
so I stopped to turn around and say okay

136
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,850
give me every BGP announcement that is

137
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,530
on the planet and I had lots of friends

138
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,140
give me data on that and then I used a

139
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,210
couple of fun tools to try and visualize

140
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,550
what it looked like I would have never

141
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,880
suspected how many those black dots by

142
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,390
the way they're not Canada I would have

143
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,060
never suspected how often our data

144
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,850
traverses outside of Canada and then

145
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,470
back into Canada especially with a lot

146
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,020
of our critical infrastructures if you

147
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,880
understand how routing goes if anybody

148
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,650
can actually sit at any of those routers

149
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,490
along the way you can peek happen

150
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:58,919
problem number one and you'd think it's

151
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,980
stable right our internet never changes

152
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,470
it's totally it's put together it's

153
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,260
engineered fantastically it's it never

154
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,990
changes right we can always tell because

155
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,790
we could put up perfect monitoring all

156
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,010
the companies who do bgp monitoring

157
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:18,270
raise your hand so do you want to know

158
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,500
how often our landscape changes let me

159
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,840
walk you through that in the last week

160
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,740
we've had three new a SS pop up

161
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,800
I wrote a scraper by the way because bgp

162
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,320
Mun is expensive and I'm a home

163
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,810
search her in this area so I just wrote

164
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,740
my own as you can see so I've I noticed

165
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,030
that we had these three changes while I

166
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,380
was trying to build this presentation

167
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,830
out and I went huh what are they doing

168
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,930
absolutely nothing what those zeros mean

169
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,760
is they have no ip's attached to them

170
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,020
they're not doing any announcements

171
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,570
they're not doing ipv6 they just created

172
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,660
asses for fun and this is not all one

173
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,770
company these are three separate

174
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,670
companies then I stuck on huh why would

175
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,410
you create new a asses and never use

176
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:09,210
them makes me wonder next thing that

177
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,720
makes me wonder is how much did we

178
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,300
change so what I see is day over day

179
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,850
things like this where this is which is

180
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,350
one of those little dots that we saw

181
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,070
it's like a note like Bell has 13 a s's

182
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,630
and tell us has six and so forth I think

183
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,360
Scotiabank has four in this particular

184
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,410
case they dropped of the number of IP

185
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,510
ciders that they announced they dropped

186
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,480
almost thirty of them makes you wonder

187
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,890
you go like why would you all of a

188
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,710
sudden drop a SS other than two or ip's

189
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,650
other than a mating consolidate and then

190
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,540
they dropped some more as well I'm like

191
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,570
huh interesting makes me wonder where

192
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,920
did that IP space all of a sudden

193
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,650
disappear - and I can see this happening

194
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,340
in a few different locations so going

195
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,630
back to that other zero

196
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,530
I like monitoring my zeros if if an if

197
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,020
one of those little dots on my map had

198
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,290
no ip's announcing from it AKA it had no

199
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,510
machines sitting on it why would those

200
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,640
machines all of a sudden start talking

201
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,950
well maybe it was one of the brand new a

202
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,320
SS maybe they put it online and it took

203
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,060
them a few weeks to architect it and put

204
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,230
new numbers up right

205
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,240
by the way this is all Canada I should

206
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,510
mention that ol Canada and yet when I go

207
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,030
and look at that a s they've been around

208
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:35,549
since 2014 all of a sudden you have

209
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,010
these a SS that have been dead for years

210
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,320
and I have years worth of data as I can

211
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,690
go back zero zero zero zero zero you

212
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,400
have a SS that pop up and start

213
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,610
announcing IP space and they are sending

214
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,510
out

215
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,780
that have been not used forever in

216
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,350
Canada regularly anybody who has a

217
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,940
router an eg bt b GP router can see

218
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,920
these announcements keep an eye out for

219
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,470
it you'll start seeing some of this

220
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:11,040
stuff too this is how many changes I saw

221
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,580
in the last two weeks it and I'm it

222
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,390
numbered over 400 changes in a week how

223
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,430
are we supposed to monitor something

224
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,970
that radically changes all the time just

225
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,320
think about that problem and the bad

226
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:33,480
guys know this so the next thing I want

227
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,220
to talk to you about is that's at the

228
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,070
transportation level let me talk to you

229
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,080
now about the application layer and the

230
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,960
services layer the other thing I see

231
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,360
here in Canada a lot is that sometimes

232
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,460
we cause our own problems not only just

233
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,800
from how we're somewhat loose on how we

234
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,720
architect the base bone the backbone of

235
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,530
it but things like there probably

236
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,610
shouldn't be a government department

237
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,650
that has a wide-open polycon just saying

238
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,690
I would not want to be sitting there

239
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,500
listening in on this other things I

240
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:14,070
could see showed an heating service

241
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,580
management tools sitting out in the open

242
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,050
this is the one is a mom that really

243
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,330
really bothered me was that I could see

244
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,110
the kids

245
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,110
I could see pictures of homes it just

246
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,670
goes into images and Showdown and you're

247
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,840
gonna see all of this why do you think

248
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,080
we're getting attacked so much I have a

249
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,730
presentation that I do that's called we

250
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,600
don't need 0 days we don't I love the

251
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,040
young kids that come up to me and say I

252
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,720
found a new exploit I found a new it

253
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,210
fantastic maybe we could plug some of

254
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,330
the older ones first because this is how

255
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,560
these attacks are coming through and

256
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,950
I'll talk about that in a second this

257
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,930
was my favorite there is somebody out

258
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,360
there that has their network management

259
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,630
tool sitting clear text clear no

260
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,850
authentication

261
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:06,290
all out on the internet I was talking

262
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,970
about the routing before not being very

263
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,480
stable

264
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:16,150
I wonder why so now let me talk about

265
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,710
what this is all caused by is open ports

266
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:23,030
that are being abused so before I talk

267
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,580
about who's who and what and where in

268
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,420
different cities

269
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,570
let me just contextualize by saying

270
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,440
Canada is not the worst this is

271
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,860
proportional by population so in terms

272
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,270
of exposures were definitely not the

273
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,800
worst country out there and I studied

274
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,530
most of the globe at this point but we

275
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,630
still could do better

276
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,060
so a city by city breakdown Toronto

277
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,590
Montreal I kind of expect they have

278
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,340
massive data centers they're some of the

279
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,900
police's that I had not expected was

280
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,080
Kitchener anybody want to know why we

281
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,160
have so much open and Kitchener I'm

282
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,190
interactive like yell yeah yeah the the

283
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,560
University right all the kids are trying

284
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,840
to experiment etc I had to stop and

285
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,250
think about it when I started looking at

286
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,560
the IP space I went uh okay I makes more

287
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,510
sense now so a lot of honey pots and

288
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:19,370
stuff are sitting out there so this is

289
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,590
the breakdown actually by by the

290
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,330
different services I know that is near

291
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,770
impossible to see from where you are

292
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,590
right now but the rough summary is that

293
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:34,780
I see a lot more folks now migrating to

294
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,390
using secured services so things like

295
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,910
HTTP I want to see out on the Internet I

296
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,770
want to see them exposed it's kind of

297
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,600
redundant to have a web page that is an

298
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,550
internet exposed but there's some of

299
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,500
these other services in here that really

300
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,160
really do not need to be on there and we

301
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,180
have them wide open so this is the just

302
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,870
the data model that goes along with it

303
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,430
some of the things that I also saw as

304
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,980
I've been monitoring it is a significant

305
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,290
amount of router protocol I can now see

306
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,910
so you know that nice little box you

307
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,950
have sitting at home there moving it was

308
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,930
Comcast and AT&T started pushing a new

309
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:15,590
protocols

310
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,890
see wmp and i don't mind see see wmp

311
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,780
being exposed out in the internet but

312
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,820
when the home box their internal router

313
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,280
protocols are being exposed I think

314
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,150
maybe that's something we should

315
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:30,500
probably take a look at so again all of

316
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,210
these little things we talked about the

317
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,440
bad guys and they're doing the attacks

318
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,360
but we're making them pretty easy for

319
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,860
them right

320
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,740
is there an is it really really

321
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,730
necessary to have 9000 devices out there

322
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,820
that are no authentication at all

323
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,270
required for SMB that's data transfer is

324
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:54,560
there any reason for this this is Canada

325
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,490
again by the way

326
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:58,040
and this is what it looks like so I'm

327
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,840
just again in show Dan sitting there

328
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,200
looking and going huh what can I see

329
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,940
what's the data that spits back and it's

330
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,190
giving me all its commands so I could go

331
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,990
and play with it and see if I can send

332
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,120
back and forth I don't I see if the door

333
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,470
is there I never go through the door

334
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,570
there are people that are much better

335
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,610
and you know rare hats than I am that do

336
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:21,410
that so to summarize it's basically like

337
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:22,700
we've taken off the firewall and we're

338
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,080
just basically letting them pass right

339
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,860
through right everybody goes where am I

340
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,600
getting attacked I'm like look at your

341
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,130
architecture I know we have some really

342
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,380
good architects in this room right now

343
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,720
please spread the word around to your

344
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,730
colleagues so they get your good work as

345
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:42,080
well so let me talk to you about some of

346
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,570
the attacks that I see purely because of

347
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,970
this these are not zero days that are

348
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,810
being exploited these are not these are

349
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,870
just wide open you can see them somebody

350
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,520
has gone through and changed a whole

351
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,720
bunch of host names and they've hacked

352
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,150
the router because the rotor had no

353
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,680
authentication on it so they managed to

354
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,030
just go in and change the device name

355
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,480
and change the configuration on it for

356
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,650
giggles so standard hacking I can see

357
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,510
through this I can see data breaches

358
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,730
everybody goes my data was breached but

359
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,460
this is how money I can see like MySQL

360
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,570
Postgres MongoDB I can see my SQL

361
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,250
servers I can see CouchDB all sitting

362
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,020
exposed their data is literally I just

363
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,660
go in I take a MySQL workbench

364
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,790
I take the domain name for that I've

365
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,160
picked the domain name up from show

366
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,160
Dan's web page and I log into the

367
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,130
database and then I cry that I've had a

368
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,760
data breach can we fix some of this

369
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:50,810
stuff so picking on MongoDB well when I

370
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,089
checked this last week there were 60

371
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:57,800
gigs of data corporate data sitting out

372
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,810
raw on the internet just from this one

373
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:03,070
database that was sitting in the clear

374
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,790
fortunately we are not as bad as some

375
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,339
countries as you can see but that's

376
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:09,829
still unnecessary and it's not a

377
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:11,870
criticism I know how hard it is to

378
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,760
architect something and one person twigs

379
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,130
one thing and all of a sudden your whole

380
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,810
security architecture has a hole that

381
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,880
just got rerouted it's a really

382
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,010
challenging problem to lock it all down

383
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,060
but it is so important to do so I wanted

384
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,790
to give you a little visualization of

385
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,230
the data that I could see from that

386
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,420
database the thing is the ransomware

387
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,170
guys beat me to it

388
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:40,940
so I was able to do what I did do

389
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,620
instead though is I scrape the open

390
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,130
shares that I could see in Canada so

391
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,769
these are the open share names for

392
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:51,310
everything that I could find in Canada

393
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,569
the ones that I find particularly

394
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:58,130
interesting are backup C D clear on the

395
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,440
Internet

396
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,459
again I go to the door I don't go

397
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:02,839
through the door I would love to know

398
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,660
what the files are on this I'm not gonna

399
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,660
do it but even just the names kind of

400
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,780
give me an idea share shared pictures

401
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,209
the fun part is of ransomware decided

402
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:15,799
that it was just gonna hit all of these

403
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:18,049
open shares it could knock out that

404
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:20,540
whole 60 gig just lock it all down like

405
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,819
that cuz they're all wide open and

406
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:29,690
they've done it before too so if any of

407
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,010
you've known me for a while you know

408
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,480
that even though I do malware these days

409
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,309
DDoS is my my favorite kind of attack

410
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:39,320
we're talking about open things and

411
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,450
everybody hears there can't be a single

412
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,830
person in this room that has not heard

413
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,160
about

414
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,590
Mariah or botnets or booters I'm

415
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,780
assuming right we're at a security

416
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,790
conference so how does something like

417
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:54,470
this get so effective okay these use

418
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,840
specific ports they might do it directly

419
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,420
off of servers they own compromised or

420
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,040
machines that they've hijacked through a

421
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,350
variety of different ways but they use

422
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,830
specific ports so I thought huh instead

423
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,420
of trying to actually hack these boxes

424
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,590
I'm gonna see how many of these are

425
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,770
actually open so I can see if they can

426
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,540
just forget hack in the box they're just

427
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,400
gonna use it because we've let them keep

428
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,700
it wide open so I went okay in show Dan

429
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,480
how many of these ports are open with no

430
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,070
authentication so for Linux and for

431
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,530
Windows and then I want it to be a

432
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,750
little more subjective about it I kind

433
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,120
of went through and said okay yeah they

434
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,290
might be open but maybe there's

435
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,790
safeguards or maybe they don't have the

436
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,140
services are necessary so I actually

437
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,030
went and reconfigured so instead of

438
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,010
being in the hundreds of thousands it's

439
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,820
only like 40 mm only 40 mm ports that

440
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,770
those botnets can take advantage of and

441
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,690
they're spread out across the globe

442
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:57,110
Canada is in there so the next thing we

443
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,700
do with DDoS is we have to amplify it

444
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,200
it's not enough to send the traffic you

445
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,210
want to send one packet there where it

446
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:06,020
reflects off and sends 50 back right so

447
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,360
then I thought okay so how many

448
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,320
reflectors are out there so now I know

449
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,660
how many those ports can be used but how

450
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,250
many reflectors can I actually figure

451
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,730
out right so the different protocols NTP

452
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,510
charge in etc and these are if you want

453
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,670
to see the math behind it the slides for

454
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,010
that and then I said ok now show me all

455
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,230
of the boxes out there that I can

456
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,110
reflect off of and how many of those are

457
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,500
open and in a usable state that I can

458
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,680
actually use them for such that column

459
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,030
over there that's Canada

460
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,970
we're like sixth on the list of

461
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:43,730
countries that this can like that we

462
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,200
have the most number of open servers

463
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,550
that can be used to commit these DDoS is

464
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,850
with so the next question is so what

465
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:53,360
happens when I take my 42,000 that I

466
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,890
found but can be relays to my

467
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:01,100
five million or so open protocols that

468
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,200
can be amplified to some significant

469
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,130
degree basically the internet goes boom

470
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,820
if I try and use all of those now when I

471
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,490
did the math for this please I don't

472
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,860
want this tweeted etc but when I did the

473
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,500
basic math rate it works out to about a

474
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:24,190
12 and a half terabyte per second attack

475
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:28,220
the maximum largest pipe that I know in

476
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,559
Canada sits somewhere between six and

477
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,429
seven gigs so if I took all of the

478
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:35,659
protocols that are out there right now

479
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:37,789
and I fired it across Canada Canada's

480
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:41,059
internet would shut down as it stands

481
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:44,840
today so you can implement all the

482
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,250
wonderful security and I'm shooting

483
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,779
myself in the foot as a security vendor

484
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:48,950
you can have all of the wonderful

485
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,080
products that you have in place until we

486
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,750
solve the port problem you're gonna

487
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,130
still have attack vectors that are gonna

488
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,370
come after you so what can you do to

489
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,169
help on this particular problem please

490
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:03,350
make sure that your internet Hygiene is

491
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,029
as secure as you can get it nobody's

492
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:07,429
gonna get it perfect I done architecture

493
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:09,500
I understand how hard it is but if you

494
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,880
could do the best that you could and

495
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,190
doing it we could really piss them off

496
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,899
by making it so much harder for them to

497
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:19,880
do so now let me talk about some of the

498
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,320
other threats that I see now that I've

499
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,120
harped on that we're doing it to

500
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,779
ourselves so some of the modern cyber

501
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:29,539
threats so the bad guy knows that we

502
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,460
have these weaknesses so now let's talk

503
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,130
about the malware components of this so

504
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,690
they know all of these holes they want

505
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,970
to use and leverage our boxes for a

506
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:41,390
variety of different monetization you've

507
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,490
got standard malware you've got

508
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,169
ransomware these days you've got coin

509
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:48,559
miner malware these days is all about

510
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,190
big business

511
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,260
I am personally chasing one right now

512
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,970
called Kotak if you have not heard about

513
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,460
it I suggest you look into it it is the

514
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,679
worst kept secret best kept secret in

515
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,179
malware I love these guys they basically

516
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:05,120
will come in infect your machine through

517
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,890
spam or standard watering hole

518
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,049
techniques they scrape your machine to

519
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:10,040
turn around and say

520
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,320
ha what is your machine interesting

521
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,180
about first it forensic ly profiles your

522
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,620
machine looks what shares you can grab

523
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,580
checks what data files you have on it

524
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,510
checks shares data files your network

525
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,660
speed it does a call out to check how

526
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,180
fast you can go back and forth it then

527
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,760
decides what you were best for if you

528
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,410
are a really good data it scrapes all

529
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,450
your data and exports it if you have

530
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,850
really good pipes it automatically

531
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,220
auctions you off into infrastructure for

532
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,210
services sales and downloads the new

533
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,070
whoever their buyer is down on your

534
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,700
machine I love this thing and if all oh

535
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,280
and by the way they will also do

536
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,200
competitive intelligence by selling the

537
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,320
profile of your machine based on how

538
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,820
often in how many pieces of malware I

539
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,740
can see doing that I swear to god there

540
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,120
is somebody out there that has network

541
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,760
maps for every company in Canada you

542
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,710
have to you've just you've gotten so

543
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,120
many of the individual machines you put

544
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,800
that all into a really good database and

545
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,230
Bob's your uncle

546
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,730
if all those files for all of that

547
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,050
harvesting and it still doesn't work it

548
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,120
will drop ransomware on you just to make

549
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,720
sure it gets that last penny out of you

550
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,220
these are the business models these guys

551
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:32,020
are using ok so

552
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,919
the other thing that's really unique to

553
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,230
Canada it's starting in other countries

554
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,340
too but the one thing that's really

555
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,840
unique to Canada is digital extortion

556
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,039
because we're nice and we don't want to

557
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,330
make waves and we don't want to call the

558
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:48,139
police so we pay did you know I had to

559
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:50,360
fight in trend to get somebody to study

560
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,700
digital extortion because they said who

561
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,909
would pay this whole method of trying to

562
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:59,240
ddos or lock up somebody wouldn't happen

563
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,980
and I said well this is why you have to

564
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,820
take culture into threat analysis your

565
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,649
national culture does actually play a

566
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:09,169
fairly big part into it so most

567
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:10,999
countries don't have the ransomware

568
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:12,950
problem that we do and the digital

569
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,360
extortion problem that we do because

570
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,110
most Canadians go ok there you go and

571
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,279
they don't call it in and we don't do

572
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,259
statistics so the RCMP can't get enough

573
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,799
statistics to open cases and it's a

574
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,970
never-ending circle and we see it not

575
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,460
only for ransomware but we see it for

576
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,749
things like you know hacked services

577
00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:37,970
just straight out digital extortion pay

578
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,249
me X number of Bitcoin or I'm gonna DDoS

579
00:24:40,249 --> 00:24:41,690
you to the point that you lose all your

580
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:45,169
customers to the point that fireEye and

581
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:47,179
yes I love any competitor that gets bad

582
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:50,539
guys chased after we fire I has called

583
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:52,610
out a specific group that targets

584
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,279
Canadians for doing digital extortion we

585
00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:01,639
have our own group yay this is why I've

586
00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:05,019
been doing this work for 30 years so

587
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,659
most recently as you've heard there's

588
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:14,330
been breaches that have come out the fun

589
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,799
part is they're not content with just

590
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:18,049
causing the breach they send blackmail

591
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,269
requests into and they've all been

592
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,519
attacked by it like to turn around and

593
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:26,269
say these poor victims I agree it is

594
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:27,889
horrible but the thing is we need to

595
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:31,850
it's us against them right and it sucks

596
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,289
that they're taking our data and they're

597
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:34,999
using it as leverage against companies

598
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:37,100
to try and extort them into paying for

599
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,809
us and they're all willing to do it to

600
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:40,609
protect Canadians because that's our

601
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:44,659
culture away but those are a lot of the

602
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:45,990
tacks that I'm seeing more

603
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,909
and I can't see digital extortion going

604
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:53,970
away anytime soon so let me go back a

605
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,200
step here and talk about some of the

606
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,750
very key concepts that I want you to

607
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,429
understand before I get into the

608
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:01,710
hardcore Ness of of malware and some of

609
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,789
my malware stats that I've been seeing

610
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:07,649
in the last year it's not heard it's not

611
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,320
I see so many consultants going into

612
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,080
organizations and saying they talked

613
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,789
about this complex problem and they put

614
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:16,620
all the buzzwords and do I look like I

615
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,120
am a buzz word kind of person okay I

616
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,440
will dress fancy for the panel tomorrow

617
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,659
but I'm here to talk to you about real

618
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:28,649
practical solutions please do me a favor

619
00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:30,809
don't go in and confuse your folks don't

620
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:32,929
go in and confuse your customers or your

621
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:34,770
clients or things along those lines

622
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,710
don't confuse your employees it's really

623
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,330
easy you get a piece of code that drops

624
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,649
on your machine and it's trying to do

625
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:42,899
bad things we don't have to call it six

626
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:45,059
different names they call back to their

627
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:46,980
infrastructure we use a different a

628
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,570
whole bunch of different techniques we

629
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,190
can have the fit I know an organization

630
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,020
that will specifically come up with a

631
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,659
new term for everything only because

632
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:56,039
they want to have the lock on the buzz

633
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:59,510
word does this help anybody

634
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,700
it really doesn't try and keep this

635
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,919
stuff simple as simple as possible

636
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:07,399
because it is not Primus crimes crime

637
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:11,340
okay every piece of malware in my 30

638
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,929
years and I swear to God I have been

639
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:14,490
doing it for 30 years I had a professor

640
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,830
walk in and go my computer is stoned you

641
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:20,370
know it always follows the same thing

642
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:23,580
they get infected they do something to

643
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,059
the machine they call home and they

644
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,789
protect themselves that's it it is not

645
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:33,090
complicated it is not all of this fancy

646
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,210
that's all malware is and every other

647
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,370
type of crime can be broken down into a

648
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,100
process step like this - we shouldn't

649
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,309
start saying we're gonna solve security

650
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:45,600
because in the course of humankind we

651
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,210
never have so if we can think of it

652
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,500
simple we can tackle some of this

653
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,649
problem much more easily so now for the

654
00:27:52,649 --> 00:27:56,710
good stuff malware infection rates

655
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,760
because you all were kind enough to have

656
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,770
me here in 2015 I actually have some

657
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,420
historical that I can show you trending

658
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,460
on this what's been really interesting

659
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,170
over the course of the last three years

660
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:08,900
is that I've seen infection rates go up

661
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,960
and then down and then up and then down

662
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,630
so in 2015 we were sitting around 75,000

663
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,620
and by the way I use the same

664
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,890
fingerprint every single time so I know

665
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:21,890
roughly and then when I did this again

666
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,050
in the fall of 2016 all of a sudden

667
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:28,910
we're up to 700,000 and the next year we

668
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:32,560
were we were back down to 150 or so and

669
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,760
we're still hovering around there and it

670
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,530
makes you wonder what's what's going on

671
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,930
with these peaks and valleys my guess is

672
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,760
there's new pushes of malware there's

673
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,320
new solutions for it there's new pushes

674
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,420
of malware there's new solutions for it

675
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,830
we tend to sit around 150,000 infected

676
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,560
nodes year over year we do have spikes

677
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,500
based on new attack vectors but more or

678
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,570
less that's roughly where Canada sits in

679
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,780
terms of it now you're looking at my

680
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,320
valleys in all of these anybody can tell

681
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:12,340
me why I have these valleys sorry Cal

682
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:17,420
those are weekends and I would love to

683
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,740
be up here and say oh the bad guys take

684
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,980
the weekends off it's not that be

685
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,820
careful when you look at threat data my

686
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,080
visibility is my visibility it's my

687
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,480
customer base and other tools that I

688
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,280
have access to my visibility is

689
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,900
primarily enterprise and home users my

690
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,520
enterprise base is much larger than my

691
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,890
home user base hence my data is

692
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,950
potentially skewed to being less on the

693
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,410
weekend if whoever's providing you

694
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,370
threat intelligence doesn't

695
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,730
contextualize it please ask them further

696
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,830
so I would take my valleys with a grain

697
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,660
of salt I suspect that that has more to

698
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,000
do with my own lack of visibility on the

699
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,140
weekend when everybody goes home and

700
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:03,650
shuts their machine so top malware's

701
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:07,700
that we've been seeing so in the fall of

702
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,610
2016 we

703
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,429
he had just started to see the ramp up

704
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:15,160
of ramp somewhere and ransom note and a

705
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,490
few of these kinds of ransomware adware

706
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,090
things the next year we saw it really

707
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,910
shoot up to the top the previous one in

708
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,700
2016 we could see more of the toolbars

709
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,460
that were occurring and then in 2017 all

710
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,230
sudden the business model of ransomware

711
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,850
just exploded we could see it all over

712
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:37,510
the place what's interesting this year

713
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,700
is ransomware has actually dropped back

714
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,510
down again all of a sudden the number

715
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,340
one thing I'm seeing these days is

716
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:50,919
trojan.downloader x' why is that I have

717
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:57,030
seen huge spikes in terms of downloaders

718
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,960
related to Imhotep which is one of the

719
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,600
new kits that's being downloaded so when

720
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,160
you see somebody that's created a new

721
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,690
fish campaign you can all of a sudden

722
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:13,179
see these huge spikes there's not an

723
00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:14,890
organization that I know that isn't

724
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,690
trying to deal with the fact that all of

725
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,640
a sudden whoever the actors are behind

726
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,590
it are making huge pushes the last three

727
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,990
months in getting more BOTS put in I'm

728
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,059
not sure if it's all of a sudden people

729
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:26,890
have machines and their old BOTS came

730
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,020
off and they have to do new pushes but

731
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,910
there's been a huge collective push in

732
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:33,790
Canada the last three months or so as

733
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,400
far as I can see in my data in terms of

734
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,020
trying to collect more to put into their

735
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:42,910
infrastructure or resell it the other

736
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,200
thing that I like to talk about I call

737
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,600
it the rebels versus the Empire it's

738
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,790
basically like AWS canoe kiyose against

739
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,960
some of the countries that we would

740
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,309
otherwise think not never not

741
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:54,520
necessarily so great the one thing that

742
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,740
I really love about these statistics

743
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,049
statistics is most people go Oh China

744
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:03,040
Oh Russia did you know that we're

745
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,630
attacked by the you like the new

746
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,220
malicious traffic that comes in bound by

747
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,890
Canada the number one location for it

748
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,870
coming inbound to Canada is the US

749
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:16,510
that's I can do it right here so see

750
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,230
this one right here

751
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:25,150
so for the last 30 days I think it is

752
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:29,130
I could see 16,000 unique IPS coming in

753
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:34,680
to Canada sending in malicious traffic

754
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,430
that beats everything

755
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:40,980
heads down right and we do it to the US

756
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,300
but is it four times more often than

757
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:49,150
Russia does no wonder we Cana sillier

758
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,890
you know surprise nobody has come up and

759
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,840
said who the evil canada hacking

760
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,850
everything and when you wonder when you

761
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,920
ask why it comes back to those open

762
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,020
ports it doesn't mean that the actor is

763
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,430
coming from that location it means

764
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,600
that's where all of this traffic is

765
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,020
bouncing off of these days right so we

766
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,900
no longer in an era where we are the

767
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,970
victims we are becoming part of the

768
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:12,910
infrastructure and the fun part is is

769
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,800
that if anybody follows legislation

770
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,570
these days there's also a liability

771
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:19,080
issue that is now being introduced

772
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,660
especially in the US and now with GDP

773
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,930
are your machine's attack somebody as

774
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:29,230
much going out from yours and bouncing

775
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,090
out you could potentially within the

776
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:34,590
next year to be liable for that attack

777
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,300
something to think about so it's not

778
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,980
just the inbound attacks to be careful

779
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,650
of and please don't just use geo

780
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:43,240
assuming that you know where you're the

781
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,330
attack vector is actually coming through

782
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,680
really analyze it and take a look at it

783
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,120
because it might be different than what

784
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,380
you think so the next question that I

785
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,360
get asked a lot is okay so that's all

786
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,950
the very very generic malware

787
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,980
what about ransomware and it's sorry

788
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:06,970
sorry what about apt it's been a long

789
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:11,710
day so I think it shocks nobody when I

790
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,020
say the bulk of what I see in terms of

791
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:19,690
apt servers are sitting in OVH most of

792
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,050
them are the extreme rat which is a

793
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:26,620
really nasty kind of variant I know that

794
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,239
there's various folks trying to work on

795
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,810
that particular problem but the way that

796
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,820
OVH is distributed across the

797
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,199
that makes it very difficult because

798
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,179
even if because of the way they're

799
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,980
tunneled it makes it hard to just it's

800
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,139
not like Bell and Bell or tell us or any

801
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,310
of them you say I want to take this box

802
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,918
off and the box pretty much stays off

803
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,840
when you have these large distribution

804
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,550
points across the globe and they're all

805
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,929
mirrored across one another it becomes

806
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:51,429
much more problematic to take it offline

807
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:54,610
that's kind of the context of it but

808
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,290
again it it behooves you to pay

809
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,700
attention to where your inbound traffic

810
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,410
is because you could be looking at going

811
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,290
oh inbound traffic to my network is fine

812
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:05,740
because it's coming from Canada it might

813
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:11,410
not be and by the way I'm not beating up

814
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,610
on the telcos here I was with Bell ten

815
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,860
years I love Bella still bleed blue so

816
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,890
the other thing everybody always asks me

817
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,600
about what's the worst operating system

818
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,610
did you know consistently for the last

819
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,250
five years I've seen Windows 7 Ultimate

820
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,830
professional service pack 1 as the worst

821
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,260
operating system out there and that's

822
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,210
not because of where my customer base is

823
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,710
actually ironically because I've looked

824
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,920
at it proportionally as well I will be

825
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,930
happy to say this is the first time and

826
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,520
I run these stats every quarter this is

827
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,060
the first quarter I finally not seen X X

828
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,880
P up here so thank you for whoever has

829
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,560
finally gotten the last of them off

830
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,970
their network and off the internet yeah

831
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,650
it's fun when you turn around and say

832
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,910
most of our threats are still coming

833
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:05,440
from XP ok so we've talked about in my

834
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,110
story the internet and how stable it is

835
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,600
we've talked about the open ports and

836
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,210
how they're being used to bounce these

837
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:16,030
attacks through and off of we've talked

838
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,010
about the fun malware that's out there

839
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,750
that is trying to take advantage of this

840
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:24,100
and us the final piece that I have for

841
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,710
you is the Canadian Underground and this

842
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,210
is always the part that everybody likes

843
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,770
to hear about because they go oooh what

844
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,460
are the guys doing with this stuff the

845
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,140
one thing I want to say is everybody

846
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,340
goes ooh the Underground and in my

847
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,470
liking keeping things simple the

848
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,900
Underground has just glorified

849
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,160
marketplaces make sure to protect

850
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,360
yourself when you're there because the

851
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,410
guys are kids

852
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,470
most or active adults and they want to

853
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,599
turn around and they will you know be

854
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:55,210
vindictive if you are on it but by far

855
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,549
and large if you've ever used eBay any

856
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,020
underground marketplace you would be

857
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,339
well familiar with other than the fact

858
00:37:00,339 --> 00:37:01,480
that you have to get vetted and you have

859
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,180
to get asked to be on etc this one I

860
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,579
loved well I was strolling around on it

861
00:37:06,579 --> 00:37:08,380
because you loved looking at the Raiders

862
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,599
like it boggles my mind I'm gonna sell a

863
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:13,059
credit card but I have a Raiders rank

864
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:15,220
here on how good my credit cards etc and

865
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,599
the guy keeps talking about how what an

866
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:19,809
amazing guy the seller is and he loves

867
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:24,069
the vendor so when I stalk about the

868
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:25,140
underground

869
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,170
it's just toward sites it's not again

870
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,579
it's not super complicated I know

871
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:31,809
there's lots of folks and threat

872
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:33,130
intelligence that would like to tell you

873
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:36,579
oh I did this complicated tour with you

874
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:39,099
you know blah blah blah blah it's not

875
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:41,500
hurt and if anybody wants a lesson on it

876
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,329
give me a shout I will show you I don't

877
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:45,039
advocate it but I know a lot of

878
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:46,660
organizations are saying I have to troll

879
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,470
the darknet I'm sorry I know you guys

880
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:54,220

881
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,559
really hard you like I sit there with my

882
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:58,359
morning coffee and go oh look what these

883
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,349
silly guys are doing today so anyone

884
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:03,910
want to take a guess what's the number

885
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,289
one thing our Canadian underground is

886
00:38:05,289 --> 00:38:14,619
selling louder we don't have to do pot

887
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:21,760
anymore close ok oh and by the way it

888
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,480
looks no different than eBay you were

889
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,549
all right in his drugs different kind of

890
00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:31,170
drugs number one thing we see myself

891
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:37,660
viagra to Americans trust me I like I

892
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,369
said this is my morning coffee I get

893
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:44,079
laughed up by my kids my god look look I

894
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,240
kid you not it's just it's a me and it's

895
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,309
the comments that are left it's just

896
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:53,069
it's better than TV I sort of got so ex

897
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:56,460
all of these things that the Americans

898
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,920
senior citizens can't afford they come

899
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,240
up to the Canadian underground

900
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,890
i'ts and they turn around and try and

901
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,660
buy them cheaper and of course we also

902
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,950
have crystal meth and the rest of them

903
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,869
that they can buy but by far and large

904
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:11,200
it's us senior citizens or other folks

905
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,610
who can't afford their medicines coming

906
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,290
up to the Canadian marketplace because

907
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,670
they can even have it shipped directly

908
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,990
to our border and then they just drive

909
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,550
up across the border and go back again

910
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:21,400
it's fairly easy for shipping although I

911
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,130
would like to point out that my favorite

912
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,350
of all of the Underground's is the

913
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,820
Middle East underground because it is

914
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,500
already starting to offer delivery by

915
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,640
drone I can't wait to see that here too

916
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:39,340
ok so more seriously the thing that I

917
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,320
always keep going going I hope this time

918
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,640
I'm not gonna find it I hope I'm not

919
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,430
gonna find it we still the next biggest

920
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,320
thing I see sold on the Underground is

921
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,580
ID I see a variety of different ones

922
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,220
credit cards that I swear to God look

923
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,869
identical I could not tell the

924
00:39:55,869 --> 00:39:57,670
difference I have talked to some police

925
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,260
officer friends of mine who've looked at

926
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,750
scans who try purchasing it they are

927
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,820
real I don't know how the hell these

928
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:08,109
guys are doing it so that drivers

929
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:13,540
license it's about 500 bucks to buy it's

930
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,950
not once you have a driver's license you

931
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,560
can't fully set up an ID completely

932
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,730
covered for about 500 bucks Canadian the

933
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:24,070
other one that I like that I found SIM

934
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:28,380
card anybody want to sing card

935
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,540
ironically the SIM card is even cheaper

936
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,770
to get than the driver's license it's

937
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,600
only about two hundred and thirty-eight

938
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,760
dollars

939
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,230
so once you have a SIM card I've got a

940
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,520
bank account and I can do all sorts of

941
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,500
other fun things and these are brand new

942
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,790
I can give it whatever identity I want

943
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:47,530
the one that I laugh about is I came

944
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,390
here a couple of years ago and I talked

945
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,460
about the fact that I could buy blank

946
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,369
passports real somebody fell made them

947
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,080
fall off the truck real Canadian

948
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,090
passports and fortunately they have been

949
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,280
taken care of and you know that that

950
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,160
seller was arrested etc but you want to

951
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,630
know what we have these days just so

952
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,869
much better I just I love this one

953
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:10,720
we now have HTTP clear text note or

954
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,869
required you can go and buy a passport

955
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:15,130
because you know passports

956
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,870
so long to get these days so you can

957
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:19,180
just go online and you give them your

958
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,260
driver's license you don't have to get a

959
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,940
scan of it you just give the number any

960
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:26,230
number will do and they will print you

961
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,360
up and mail you a passport I swear to

962
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,760
god write paper everything and there is

963
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,290
this is why I said the underground is

964
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:35,050
really very loose here in Canada you

965
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:38,190
spend a little bit of time on eBay or on

966
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,120
Amazon you're gonna find a lot of the

967
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,470
same stuff or some real Google foo

968
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:44,050
you'll find it anyway and by the way all

969
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,730
of these things every time I find them I

970
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:47,230
pass them up to the proper authorities

971
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,750
and say here you go here's a new one

972
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,070
which of course shoots me in the foot

973
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,390
because next time I do this presentation

974
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:53,860
that service isn't there and I have to

975
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,330
recreate all of this to find the new

976
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:57,640
seller in the new site so maybe I should

977
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:06,040
stop telling them but yeah so the prices

978
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:12,400
for this thousand bucks so for $1,700 I

979
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,570
can set up an entire new ID complete

980
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:20,110
start to finish no problem my kid has

981
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:23,890
saved up $1700 do I want him walking

982
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:26,320
around with the driver's licence at 14

983
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,720
anybody who knows my son does not want

984
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,750
to see that happen he teaches me about

985
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:35,380
attacks sometimes he's a white hat

986
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,250
mostly

987
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:42,460
so after IDs the next thing we see love

988
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,670
is banking and I am not calling out any

989
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,530
bank here by the way because most of my

990
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:48,970
best friends run the security teams on

991
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:51,340
these and they'd kill me but all of them

992
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,110
are subject to it there's really nobody

993
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:57,850
as safe these days it's not hard to pop

994
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:01,450
somebody's account and get access to

995
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:03,370
their their account the accounts don't

996
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:04,750
last long this is why when you see out

997
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,760
of out of stock the banks are doing a

998
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,100
really good job at this point it used to

999
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,300
be that you could buy an account the

1000
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,160
account would still be good to use for

1001
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,740
like a week or so these days they have

1002
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,950
to you buy it they pop it then they give

1003
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:19,330
it to you that's why there's an escrow

1004
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,220
required all right because the

1005
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,270
underground they don't trust one another

1006
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:24,160
I'm not going to give you money before

1007
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,600
you give me the service so we both give

1008
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,160
it to an escrow and they exchange it

1009
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,930
right

1010
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:30,760
so you think this is great so this is

1011
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,110
why the banks are putting two-factor

1012
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:36,270
authentication right mm-hmm

1013
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,210
I'm getting to it and yes you can buy

1014
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:42,130
Canadian checks so now on the

1015
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:44,260
underground what are they selling CIBC

1016
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,260
tzimmes verification codes for you so

1017
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,850
the two-factor authentication what they

1018
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:51,130
do is something called sim jacking they

1019
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:53,290
they go out and literally buy pallets

1020
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:56,620
full of SIM cards hack the wonderful

1021
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:59,860
telco portals change that sim to that

1022
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:02,260
one and then take that person's account

1023
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,420
and they've basically sim jacked it and

1024
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,830
they can get the authentication codes

1025
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:10,420
sent to them and then they sell them we

1026
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,800
come up with a solution they come up

1027
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,030
with a new attack we come up with a

1028
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:14,470
solution they come up with a new attack

1029
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:19,120
it's called job security go back to 30

1030
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:28,590
years so I don't want to go on a trip

1031
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:32,500
those accounts are not the only one and

1032
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,890
when I set the bail account anyone want

1033
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,240
to take a guess at how much a bail

1034
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,150
account with full video you can get at

1035
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:46,630
their sim card costs these days dollar

1036
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:50,920
fifty okay buck fifty will get you that

1037
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,160
information and that has that is

1038
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,720
absolutely no indication on bail

1039
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,730
whatsoever I should say I look like I

1040
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:59,950
said most of my good friends are still

1041
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:03,670
there Telus has the exact same ones I

1042
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:06,640
just like hunting bells so I can give

1043
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:12,670
them that Intel but buck 50 now if I'm

1044
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,920
lazy really lazy and I don't want to go

1045
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,140
through all of those other things how

1046
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,540
about I just buy the full credit report

1047
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,760
for somebody that includes their full

1048
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,830
name date of birth all of their security

1049
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,330
questions that they would typically ask

1050
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:27,340
their drivers vehicle their sin number

1051
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,710
their insurance policies it's not this

1052
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,090
guy doesn't have it but I've seen guys

1053
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:33,010
that actually include their Apple ID in

1054
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:39,220
it as well hundred bucks so instead of

1055
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,230
paying the $1,700 and creating fake

1056
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:42,470
documents

1057
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:43,550
I can use this and just get all those

1058
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:45,770
same numbers for a hundred instead of

1059
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:52,099
1700 the fun part is you don't even

1060
00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:53,869
really need to go too deep so when I

1061
00:45:53,869 --> 00:45:56,030
went to various marketplaces to get

1062
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,590
these numbers you have to do the you

1063
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,330
know go in the tour and know what the

1064
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:02,570
address is etc but if you know what the

1065
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:04,220
marketplace names are you can actually

1066
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,859
just google them where you do you know

1067
00:46:06,859 --> 00:46:10,550
site and the forum name hack forums I

1068
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,230
wouldn't recommend because most of the

1069
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:13,940
guys on they're just kids but like if

1070
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,849
you know any of the other forums like Oh

1071
00:46:16,849 --> 00:46:21,440
J user or whatever just cite that and

1072
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,119
whatever it is you're looking for and

1073
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,280
you can find posts where they're not

1074
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,980
using a formal marketplace but they are

1075
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,660
still trying to turn around and say in

1076
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,400
this particular case the guy is selling

1077
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:39,710
doumitt Domino's gift cards right and in

1078
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:44,060
this one doing full dumps also right so

1079
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,800
it you don't have to go too deep for any

1080
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,599
of that so that is my spiel on the

1081
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,920
current threats that I'm seeing here in

1082
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,310
Canada

1083
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:09,340
