[Music]

2
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,370
all right so who is CSC now surprisingly

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,269
to me

4
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,000
only 4% Canadians in the survey knew

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,029
what CSC is so just show of hand in this

6
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:22,650
room knows what about the communications

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,350
security establishment already and

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,349
here's the 4% right here right now

9
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:30,090
fantastic so I will zoom through those

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,710
parts of the remarks because that you

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,300
know that already for the three or four

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,890
of you who don't know what the CSC is

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,559
I'll mention it very briefly so the

14
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,600
communication security establishment is

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,910
the national cyber security and foreign

16
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,430
signals intelligence agency we play an

17
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,960
integral role in helping to protect

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,110
Canada Canadians against cyber threats

19
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,940
terrorism foreign espionage attacks in

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,010
our democracy in our way of life told

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,930
you I get a cool job we worked with the

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,120
Canada Canadian Armed Forces or in

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,590
overseas military operations like

24
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,820
Afghanistan Iraq Mali recently CSC also

25
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,899
is the lead technical and operational

26
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,150
cyber security agency for the Government

27
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,030
of Canada you knew that as of 1 October

28
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,130
we are now the home of the Canadian

29
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,680
Centre for cyber security my new job and

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,930
I am proud to say today as the 1st of

31
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,850
November and we survived month number

32
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,619
one and that's fantastic

33
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,540
I wasn't bragging so much a month ago

34
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,780
I'll tell you that so the intent here is

35
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,270
we're supposed to be and become the the

36
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,770
cornerstone for the federal government

37
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,680
cyber security CSC is home to some smart

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,060
and Eirene really really smart people

39
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,790
and we have top-shelf code makers we

40
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,380
have top-shelf code breakers we have

41
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,210
mathematicians computer scientists

42
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,570
linguists analysts in a gigantic support

43
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,729
team and of course some of Canada's best

44
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,399
cybersecurity experts our expertise is

45
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,820
rooted in over 70 years of proud history

46
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,470
from the complex bold World War two

47
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,020
environment through the Cold War through

48
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,210
9/11 all the way to the complex

49
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,590
environment that we live in today with

50
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,399
multiple diverse threats that we face

51
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:03,659
the men and women of CSC were there

52
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,640
along the way we put the Canada's most

53
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,590
sensitive information in infrastructures

54
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,979
in many ways but we don't do it alone

55
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,810
according to 2017 report by the Canadian

56
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,660
Chamber of Commerce

57
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,550
Canadian economy loses more than 3

58
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,250
billion each year to cybercrime and if

59
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,810
I'm not mistaken I read report early

60
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,550
this week from the stats Canada that

61
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,410
number is now 4 billion estimated each

62
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,930
year this is the reality we face and the

63
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,910
cost of cybercrime worldwide is expected

64
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,220
to hit hold your hats six trillions

65
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,370
annually by 2021 while CSE works to

66
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,110
protect Canada against a host of foreign

67
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,270
threats the world needs to counter cyber

68
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,280
criminals too by leveraging law

69
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,890
enforcement which is why to do this we

70
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,770
will collaborate with the RCMP s

71
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,120
cybercrime coordination unit also

72
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,590
announced the national cybersecurity

73
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,930
strategy I think I'm supposed to use

74
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,410
that at some point there we go my

75
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,760
apologies but since you're only with us

76
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,170
already let's go to the next one to help

77
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,760
galvanize Canada's national cyber

78
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,470
security posture the government launched

79
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,970
an updated national cybersecurity

80
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,820
strategy in June of this year informed

81
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,530
by over 2,000 submissions from folks

82
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,480
like you and from corporations the

83
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,700
strategy addresses the gaps in areas for

84
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,960
improvement in Canada's current

85
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,780
cybersecurity climate the end result

86
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,100
will be better defence against cyber

87
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,930
threats greater security prosperity for

88
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,780
Canadians of course will be three main

89
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,960
themes security resilience innovation

90
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,110
research skill talent and leadership and

91
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,390
collaboration let me start and walk

92
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,610
through that building secure and

93
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,440
resilient Canadians Ibsen's systems is

94
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,930
really the first step to defence against

95
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,430
cyber threats but what type of threats

96
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,200
are we facing while you and this room

97
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,520
know this as much as I do today's

98
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,560
threats are coming at us more often for

99
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,600
more places and for more reasons to

100
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,250
attack tours range from sophisticated

101
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,620
foreign States to criminals and even

102
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,120
unskilled but highly motivated

103
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,520
individual hackers some are looking for

104
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,380
personal information others want

105
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,320
intellectual property or research others

106
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,240
are simply in it to make some bucks make

107
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,250
some money and as your there's lots of

108
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,380
money to be made still others want to

109
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,990
manipulate confuse miss inform and

110
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,420
divide I can share a couple of

111
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,890
real-world examples that you all know

112
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,900
already today ransomware has become

113
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,060
increasingly popular among threat actors

114
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,130
why because it makes money it generates

115
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,870
income it's a business you can go online

116
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,220
under the darker oh I'm slipping again

117
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,470
stay to the script you can go online of

118
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,900
the dark grip you can buy several cyber

119
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,060
enablers for bad things right it is a

120
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,070
market this was illustrated by the

121
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,080
global wanna cry attack back in May 2017

122
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,150
mana cry affected over two hundred

123
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,200
thousand victims in 150 countries an

124
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,850
estimated global four billion dollars in

125
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,720
lost productivity

126
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,150
wanna cry attack used worms made it to

127
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,500
self-replicate and moved pretty fast

128
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,320
across may 2018 cyber criminals

129
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,450
contacted two Canadian banks and claimed

130
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,560
to have accessed the personal

131
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,060
informations of tens of thousands of

132
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,160
clients the cyber criminals threatened

133
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,510
to release the information unless the

134
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,390
banks paid them 1 million in ransom we

135
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,890
had universities in Canada that were

136
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,960
taken for ransom we had private

137
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,910
institutions taken for ransom we had

138
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,770
government in state entities to confer

139
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,990
ransom this is growing and this is a big

140
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,840
business place these are more than just

141
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,550
attacks on our infrastructures they are

142
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,140
more than just attacks on our company's

143
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,090
net worth it's about attacks on

144
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,890
employees on reputation

145
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,600
it's about attacks on our economy and

146
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,240
security or famine fundamental freedoms

147
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,120
and I think most importantly it's about

148
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,090
attacks on our trust and confidence the

149
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,220
good news is it can be defended against

150
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,250
the impact can be contained and we can

151
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,140
do this together now how can Canadian

152
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,460
system owners begin to keep their

153
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,590
network secure and be resilient against

154
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,550
cyber threats like these it's that way

155
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,810
that's where I get to brag a little I

156
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,710
don't gonna brag throughout the

157
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,140
presentation of course the Canadian

158
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,640
Centre for cybersecurity publishes

159
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,350
advice and guidance to help them do just

160
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,120
that what do you have behind me is one

161
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,060
example amongst many of those advice and

162
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,710
guidance it's not just advice for

163
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,810
government it used to be but we're the

164
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,220
creation of a cyber center we want to

165
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,390
make that available for Canada and

166
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:01,990
Canadians

167
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,240
it's for any network owner one of the

168
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,860
most frequently accessed pieces of

169
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,830
advice on our website is this the top 10

170
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,440
IT security actions 10 simple steps to a

171
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,350
more secure and resilient network and

172
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,640
some folks that room will confirm to you

173
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,320
that what I've tasked my team to do is

174
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,720
make it simple find the things that get

175
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,250
us the most security for the least

176
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,160
effort the easiest to understand find

177
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,360
things that you can do at scale that

178
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,860
help Canada and Canadians in fact back

179
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,139
to this one in many cases doing just the

180
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:33,760
top four actions can reduce your threat

181
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,820
surface by as much as 80 percent as I

182
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,160
manage the cybersecurity part

183
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,450
should portfolio for the last three

184
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,280
years I met a lot of private sector

185
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,570
industries and government

186
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,070
representatives and let me tell you a

187
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,260
lot of people need help they want to do

188
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,610
the right things often they just don't

189
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,380
know what to do I became best friends

190
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,090
with many of them because I would I was

191
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,140
willing to go and sit down with the

192
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,520
Board of Directors and the presidents

193
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,240
and present the value proposition of

194
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,290
what you protect when you do something

195
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,970
and what you put at stake when you don't

196
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:06,100
protect yourselves most I say most cyber

197
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,450
advise adversaries are not that

198
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,700
sophisticated the goal is to make it

199
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,500
more difficult more expensive for them

200
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,590
to succeed if you can check them even a

201
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,510
bit they're likely to move on easier

202
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,840
targets it's the old bear analogy right

203
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,370
we're all running as a pack you don't

204
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,230
want to be the slowest runner and gut

205
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,220
for a bit you don't want to cover

206
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,580
yourself in honey so just keep running

207
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,380
IT security basics are just that basics

208
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,040
they're not sexy they may make you less

209
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,930
likely to become a victim and in a world

210
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,760
where cyber risk equates business risk

211
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,560
and where cyber attack often means

212
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,840
stolen assets recovery costs penalties

213
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,870
loss of confidence and productivity why

214
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,640
not invest in straightforward achievable

215
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,470
approaches the basic things I talked

216
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,690
about earlier one of those things is

217
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,460
moving to cloud it's an operative step

218
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,890
up our security but there could also be

219
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,260
some barriers to cloud adoption business

220
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,730
owners need to understand what sort of

221
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,020
risk of vulnerabilities their

222
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,450
organization may face and risk which

223
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,850
risks they are comfortable accepting the

224
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,560
cyber center works in collaboration with

225
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,080
Treasury Board already in public service

226
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,730
procurement Canada to help reduce those

227
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,650
barriers by developing security

228
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,270
requirements for contracting making

229
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,210
cloud available for government agencies

230
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,950
the cyber centers advice regarding the

231
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,880
protection and key some cue bullets

232
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,140
includes some of this kind of advice

233
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,790
making sure users are using proper

234
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,250
identification and authentication making

235
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,540
sure the cloud service providers and

236
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,550
ministers are properly cleared to manage

237
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,990
your data making sure the business

238
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,909
owners has the opportunity to inspect

239
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,610
the physical security of data centers to

240
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,030
make up the cloud not all clouds are

241
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,849
created equal make sure the processing

242
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:44,169
of offshore data is properly properly

243
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:46,330
protected make sure the data that you've

244
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,890
identified goes to where it should go

245
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,570
and then you're comfortable where it's

246
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,710
going make

247
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,000
the departments that follow an IT

248
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,950
security risk management make sure the

249
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,170
department's follow an IT security risk

250
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,100
management framework process now this is

251
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,360
the advice that we put together for

252
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,010
government and government procurement so

253
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:03,970
the next challenge

254
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,130
Jeff is to make that available to

255
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,920
everybody and everyone in this room Jeff

256
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,410
you're dozing off there buddy keeping an

257
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,090
eye on you

258
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,290
the second pillar of cyber security

259
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,420
strategy is about innovation innovation

260
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,010
is key to being effective in cyber

261
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,690
security and in turn cybersecurity

262
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,000
drives innovation in economic activity

263
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,190
in Canada making money is a good thing

264
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,170
it pays more taxes it's a good thing

265
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,970
right having a thriving economy is a

266
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:28,540
good thing

267
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,100
innovation is therefore a good thing

268
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,230
with a global cybersecurity industry

269
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,750
forecast to grow by 66% in the next

270
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,610
couple of years thousands of additional

271
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,380
jobs could be created for Canadians

272
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,320
that's both great news and bad news

273
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,310
thousands of new jobs means that

274
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,110
education and research institutions are

275
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,670
gearing up to train and equip the next

276
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,410
generation of cyber experts

277
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,880
it also means we will all be competing

278
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,890
for this new environment for this new

279
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,570
cyber expertise in these folks if you

280
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,310
and if you'll forgive me about people

281
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,880
I'm gonna boast a little bit about CSE

282
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,170
our mission has required us to innovate

283
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,000
for more than seven decades and to

284
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,930
respond to changing government

285
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,240
requirements in a very dynamic technical

286
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,310
environment this is possibly our

287
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,260
greatest strength and sets us apart from

288
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,870
many others in government with 84% of

289
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,310
CSE employees feeling that they are

290
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,170
strongly encouraged to be innovative in

291
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,030
their day to day work and I challenge

292
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,260
you to ask the folks in the room today

293
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,320
if that's true or not that's 17 percent

294
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,640
higher than the average government

295
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,920
responds the way our teams are set up

296
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,480
that we are building is designed the way

297
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,070
our computing platforms are configured

298
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,670
all fosters innovation well of course we

299
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,260
have red lines our employees operate

300
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,820
within the law they must demonstrate

301
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,150
integrity and value diversity but we ask

302
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:41,110
them to think at managing audacity not

303
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,600
managing risk and we expect them to fail

304
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,820
on the road to success they need to take

305
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,120
smart chances and solve tough problems

306
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,320
diversity also helps drive innovation

307
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,990
and CSC is a very diverse in culture

308
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,390
skills and gender that brings us fresh

309
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,180
perspectives creative ideas interesting

310
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,970
ways of looking at problems in fact Cece

311
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,290
has been named one of Canada's top

312
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,150
employers for young people in power

313
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,220
because of our diversity particularly in

314
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,880
gender almost 40% 40% of our employees

315
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,770
are women on the surface that may not

316
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,100
look like a very impressive number but

317
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,500
you might not know that the same metric

318
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,779
in Silicon Valley is 30%

319
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,540
so that's 10% more than Silicon Valley

320
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,740
CC has a higher percentage of women

321
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,170
working in technical roles than Google

322
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,600
Facebook or Twitter but we know there is

323
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,060
more that needs to be done it's fine to

324
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,890
be innovative but if we don't find ways

325
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,300
to share the fruits of our innovation

326
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,610
we're not effective because much of what

327
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,910
CSC does has been doing for 70 years is

328
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,070
classified we have struggled to share

329
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,300
our technical expertise and innovation

330
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,210
outside of our top secret walls we're

331
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,580
improving though and again ask the folks

332
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,210
in the room

333
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,370
CeeCee was proud to publicly release one

334
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,440
of our innovative cybersecurity tools

335
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,750
assembly line behind me develop in built

336
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,150
in-house assembly line is a malware tool

337
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,070
that automates a detection and analysis

338
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,810
of malicious files as they hit the

339
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,320
network or system that is a project a

340
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,080
proof of concept that we can move our

341
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,450
tools from top-secret highly classified

342
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,750
to unclassified and shift to Co

343
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,850
development and Co design assembly line

344
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,260
allows system owners to better protect

345
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,810
their data from theft and compromise it

346
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,490
allows cyber security community to

347
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,870
jointly develop this open source

348
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,050
software cyber experts from academia and

349
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,730
the private sector can customize it and

350
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,110
prove it for the benefit of their entire

351
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,050
community give back and I can tell you

352
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,490
that it's been downloaded thousands of

353
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,440
times in dozens of countries including

354
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,900
Russia and China it is now used by the

355
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,430
Norwegian Bank representing about a

356
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,410
quarter of that country's clients it's

357
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,720
used by now core energy large provincial

358
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,220
corporate air quartered in Newfoundland

359
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,140
Labrador that manages the provinces

360
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,570
energy resources even target the second

361
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,890
largest department store retailer

362
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,800
acknowledged using assembly line and the

363
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,510
cyber center will continue to work with

364
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,220
our critical infrastructure partners to

365
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,500
integrate assembly line and we encourage

366
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,660
our partners to provide feedback on the

367
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,700
quality and relevance of the tools the

368
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,920
challenge I gave the team is take this

369
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,200
go open-source and learn how to do open

370
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,890
source take the feedback be humble get

371
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,200
the community engaged if all of us in

372
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,800
this room are

373
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,630
developing and co designing we stand a

374
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,290
better chance of winning this battle

375
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,790
assembly line is one of many examples

376
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,220
that by working together we are stronger

377
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,080
and more resilient it demonstrate that

378
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,640
cybersecurity really is a team sport

379
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,130
that's a third pillar of the cyber

380
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,899
strategy leadership and collaboration

381
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,640
here we are

382
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,860
on 1 October that's where the Canadian

383
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,600
Center for cyber security really comes

384
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,000
into play cyber security experts from

385
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,220
the Canadian side see Sir the Canadians

386
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,769
cyber Incident Response Center shared

387
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:52,720
services Canada's that Sock'em share

388
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,190
services Canada in the IT security

389
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,769
branch of CSC those three organizations

390
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,300
were removed from their parent

391
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,010
organizations and bring brought together

392
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,600
as the Canadian Centre for cyber

393
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,990
security under CSC the cyber center

394
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,339
modernizers the government of Canada's

395
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:08,500
approach to cyber security into a unique

396
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,329
innovative forward-looking open

397
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:12,339
organization the mission is to help

398
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:14,079
reduce the cyber risk faced by Canada

399
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,579
and Canadians in our digital world

400
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:17,649
simply put it'll be the front door for

401
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,450
cyber security at the federal level a

402
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,250
front door for government but also for

403
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,500
industry academia and if I can go off

404
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,600
script for a second what I've used as an

405
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,640
analogy for others before it's a

406
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,560
lighthouse it's a lighthouse with three

407
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,779
floors my first floor is my innovation

408
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:33,910
and collaboration floor you can walk in

409
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,250
there's no security guards I've got to

410
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,600
Pat you down and take all your

411
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,730
electronics away quite the opposite they

412
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,070
welcome you into a room for innovation

413
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,209
your private sector you want to bring in

414
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:45,399
some new tools and some great idea your

415
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:47,890
from the local university or foreign

416
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,149
university and you have a project that

417
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:50,920
you want to demonstrate you come into

418
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,899
our place you actually show off you

419
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:54,459
bring your clients on this town you show

420
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:56,860
them the tool now well put some bars for

421
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,839
coming through the door it has to be new

422
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:00,730
it has to address new problems you have

423
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,410
to Bend together with others there has

424
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,839
to be benefit for the community but we

425
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:06,370
have an open-door policy on that first

426
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,290
floor on my second floor I'm going to

427
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,870
integrate operations and coordination so

428
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,180
as a National Center now what I want to

429
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,260
connect is not just the federal

430
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,060
government but all levels of government

431
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,199
and the critical infrastructure sector

432
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,370
systems of importance to the government

433
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,079
and I'm making that a little more

434
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:25,000
generic because really there are things

435
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,250
that change over time and a good example

436
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,500
of that is next year's election if we're

437
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,060
having elections coming up of course

438
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,810
that's a critical

439
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,850
for structure for Canada if a few years

440
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,700
laters as there's the Olympics of course

441
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,290
as a critical infrastructure for Canada

442
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,029
that's what that second floor is about

443
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:42,580
my third floor might be a bit bit small

444
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,410
but it's a very important floor and

445
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,730
that's where I stay connected with

446
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,620
communication security establishment and

447
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,120
the notes we'll talk about this in a

448
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,190
second but I don't think we could be as

449
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,990
successful at this game without our

450
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,550
foreign intelligence awareness in

451
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,440
knowledge but I'll come back to that so

452
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,700
I do have to go back to the script at

453
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:04,510
some point so what will the summary

454
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,070
Center do it will provide advice

455
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,870
guidance to help others make security

456
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,180
into system design it will partner with

457
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,100
vendors system operators that the

458
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,140
Communication Service Providers academia

459
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,420
to innovate on some of Canada's toughest

460
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,460
cyber problems it will certify advanced

461
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,810
commercial and government cryptographic

462
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,240
equipment and ensure that good crypt is

463
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,130
built properly it will defend the

464
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,570
government of Canada's networks against

465
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,279
a wide range of malicious activity and

466
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,230
most importantly it will share what we

467
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,850
learned with the private sector to help

468
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,500
them defend themselves against threats

469
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,100
it's a hub for our community but I would

470
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,570
be remiss if I didn't acknowledge that

471
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,830
part of the cyber centers unique

472
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,770
advantages CSCS other lines of business

473
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,660
foreign signals intelligence mission now

474
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,130
you might not know this if you're the

475
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,360
four people in the room that didn't know

476
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,460
about CSC but we covertly monitor

477
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,110
communications and signals of foreign

478
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,150
targets allowing us to detect and better

479
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,980
understand foreign base threats as they

480
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,339
develop we have an eye on the world we

481
00:16:57,339 --> 00:16:58,660
see what that looks like

482
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,370
we see it move around we understand how

483
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,110
it operates we see it morph you see a

484
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,300
change that's the foreign signals

485
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,609
intelligence saying that in the middle

486
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,589
of this circle is the knowledge and

487
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,810
expertise that brings CSCS effectiveness

488
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,910
together and there's no shortage of

489
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,109
those threats facing the Government of

490
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:18,220
Canada interesting statistics every day

491
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,599
hundreds of millions of malicious

492
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,459
activities directed at the Government of

493
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:23,740
Canada networks including up to 1

494

attempts to get into our databases every

500
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,070
single day it's a busy world out there

501
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,810
and it's not getting quieter

502
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,460
we know that cyber center can't do it

503
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,590
alone we ascribe to the idea that

504
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,420
cybersecurity through collaboration

505
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,490
that's why we were building partnerships

506
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,140
with academia in the private sector a

507
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,360
recent example of collaboration in our

508
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,130
recent project between the cyber center

509
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,930
the Canadian Institute for cyber

510
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,310
security at the University of New

511
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,710
Brunswick and Amazon Web Services in

512
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,900
working to test cyber defense

513
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,250
technologies we found that there was a

514
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,350
lack of high quality publicly available

515
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,960
security datasets to address this issue

516
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,420
we reached out to our partners joined up

517
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,520
with UNB you Andy indicated they might

518
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,650
be interested in this problem we needed

519
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,480
to get some compute we found a friend

520
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,170
AWS we got all of us together and

521
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,300
generated a dataset that represents I

522
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,270
think it's 10 departments 500 employees

523
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,630
13 days of our 10 days of hacking on 13

524
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,180
different scenarios that dataset is now

525
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,790
available on AWS you can if you're a

526
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,920
cyber security researcher anyone or you

527
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,510
have a tool you want to test it out you

528
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,420
can go on AWS access this data set and

529
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,040
test your tools and demonstrate your

530
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,350
theories and prove yourself to be worthy

531
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:56,340
to go into the innovation center the

532
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,600
challenge of getting the right

533
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,070
information to do research and

534
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,200
innovation is one that's that was

535
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,060
probably the most dire of need in the

536
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,040
last two years so that's why we picked

537
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,080
this project to go first but in fact

538
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,630
remember my first floor if you have a

539
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,570
bright complicated problem don't just

540
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,430
bring solutions bring problems as well

541
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,470
problem boxes are really important part

542
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,180
of the solution set what you do is you

543
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,440
come to the center and say you have this

544
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,040
problem

545
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,960
am I the only one who has this problem

546
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,790
you find friends have a common problem

547
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,290
and then we band together to look for

548
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,760
solutions and we make these solutions

549
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,390
available to the community the cyber

550
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,580
center also works with associations such

551
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,230
as the cyber threats the Canadians every

552
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,780
threat exchange is ztx see CTX if you

553
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,070
don't know is a collective of Canada's

554
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,500
largest banks telcos power and other

555
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,150
major organizations collaborating to

556
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,070
share cyber threat information across

557
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,650
sectors we don't stop there we also work

558
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,360
with international organizations like

559
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,380
the global cyber alliance the various US

560
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,290
ice ax FSI sects and other independent

561
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,429
electricity system

562
00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:00,659
operators and others the key once again

563
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,190
is creating these communities and giving

564
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,539
people with the different perspectives

565
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,549
together we don't claim to know it all

566
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:07,559
but we know that the power of the

567
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,269
community knows it all and if we can

568
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:10,710
just harness and work it together we can

569
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,600
find a better solution so we want to

570
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,029
work with you we have provided specific

571
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:16,470
information to help you defend your

572
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,539
networks in the past we tip you when we

573
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:19,950
see something that you need to address

574
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,899
we provide advice on specific cyber

575
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:23,789
threats related to your sector when we

576
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,240
see it

577
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,929
these are everyday actions in our

578
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:29,549
partnerships and relationships but these

579
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:30,720
are early days as well for our

580
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,879
relationship we know we have a lot to

581
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:34,499
offer based on our unique aperture and

582
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,360
knowledge and we need you to come to the

583
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,369
door and ask us to help you we are

584
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:39,919
committed to raising public awareness

585
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,029
about how we see cyber threat

586
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:44,129
manifesting in Canada in fact we're

587
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:45,990
preparing to release our first national

588
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,029
cyber cyber threat report in a few days

589
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:50,429
the report will discuss strategic cyber

590
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:52,409
threats that face can Eaton facing

591
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:53,999
Canadian businesses critical

592
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:55,679
infrastructures and public institutions

593
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,869
and without giving too much of it away

594
00:20:57,869 --> 00:21:00,269
here it will focus heavily of course on

595
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:02,279
cybercrime the biggest threat facing all

596
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:04,499
of us today the report will be informed

597
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:06,840
by CSC cyber defense data the expertise

598
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,429
of our people our assessment of the

599
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:10,230
overall cyber threat landscape and let

600
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,149
me pause there for a second our

601
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:14,100
knowledge is based on foreign signals

602
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,679
intelligence awareness and what we see

603
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,720
of government networks in Canada that's

604
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,409
not enough

605
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:22,049
I see 250,000 clients and what they do

606
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,669
every day that's the federal government

607
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:26,669
but collectively there are 37 million

608
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:28,200
citizens in this country that we need to

609
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,409
protect so again by joining together by

610
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:33,240
banding together we can do with much

611
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,789
more prominent among our concerns are

612
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:40,799
threats to Canada's democratic process

613
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,080
that bears mentioning as we're about to

614
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,269
enter an election year and we've all

615
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:46,860
seen and heard about cyber threats to

616
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,480
elections and the democratic processes

617
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,940
in other countries in fact last year we

618
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,529
published a first-of-its-kind public

619
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:54,450
report on cyber threats to democratic

620
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,490
processes and institutions we'll be

621
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:00,330
updating that report in early 2019 we're

622
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,980
also delivering regular thread briefings

623
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,899
to government officials cyber security

624
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:05,549
advice and guidance to political parties

625
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:07,799
into those running in or considering

626
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:08,590
running for

627
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,409
office as CSC in the cyber center work

628
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:12,999
to share knowledge and expertise we're

629
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,320
mindful that our role is not to

630
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,419
duplicate your cybersecurity efforts

631
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:18,970
it's to fill the gap between the IT

632
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,919
services that are provided today and the

633
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:21,909
most the most sophisticated

634
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:24,309
cybersecurity threats our goal is to

635
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,450
partner with the Kenyan security

636
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,970
industry to make us all safer so we're

637
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,129
all protected to the same degree as we

638
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:31,960
have been able to protect the Government

639
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,240
of Canada because all Canadians and all

640
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,889
of your customers want to connect online

641
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:39,399
with trust and confidence in closing I

642
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,619
want to leave you assured that CSC in

643
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:43,059
the cyber centre are playing critical

644
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:44,799
roles in all three pillars of the

645
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:45,850
government's national cybersecurity

646
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,549
strategy our advice and guidance can

647
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:50,080
help you in other Canadian critical

648
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,330
system owners build more resilient and

649
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,299
secure networks we are dedicated in

650
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:57,369
innovating as an organization increasing

651
00:22:57,369 --> 00:22:59,139
diversity that drives innovation and

652
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:01,119
sharing that innovation for the benefit

653
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:03,070
of everyone we are providing leadership

654
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,389
for the Government of Canada and

655
00:23:04,389 --> 00:23:06,460
collaborating with you and other others

656
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,830
in private sector to help thwart today's

657
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,899
cyber threats and to be ready to face to

658
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:13,360
the doors of tomorrow the bottom line an

659
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,769
ultimate goal is to make Canada

660
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,169
unattractive to cyber threat actors but

661
00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:19,539
we can't do it alone it will take all of

662
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:21,340
us in this room and all of us in this

663
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,679
country to ensure Canadian cyber space

664
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,570
is trusted and resilient and we look

665
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,889
forward to collaborating with us

666
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:29,159
partners in this noble pursuit

667
