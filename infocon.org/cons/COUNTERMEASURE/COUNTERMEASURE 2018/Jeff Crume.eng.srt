00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,790
good morning how's everybody doing yeah

3
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,230
well you're here we'll see if you still

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,150
feel about that same way after I'm done

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,680
but so so again I'm my name is Jeff Crum

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,109
I'm a security architect with IBM as you

7
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:26,730
can tell from the strange accent I'm not

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,029
from here I live in the u.s. I'm live in

9
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,219
Raleigh North Carolina so I don't know

10
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:33,570
if you picked that accident out or not

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,300
but nevertheless the topic I'm going to

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,670
talk about today is to me one of the

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,950
most fascinating and that which is why I

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,390
was drawn to it in the first place I

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,489
hope you'll find that it is as well this

16
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,250
notion of artificial intelligence we've

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,379
been hearing about I can remember for as

18
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:50,940
long as I've been dealing with computers

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,809
and given my advanced age you know

20
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,300
that's been a long time so 36 years with

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,460
IBM and have always been hearing you

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,020
know next year was when we were gonna

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,329
have AI or it was about five years out

24
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,069
and it was kind of a moving target and

25
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,540
whatever year you were in it was five

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,320
years away it's it's happening now and

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,330
so I'll give you some examples of that

28
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,450
during the talk but some of the things

29
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,490
that I thought would be useful to talk

30
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,960
about it we're gonna start off with a

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,759
video do you know who Tony Stark is do

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,659
you know who Iron Man is

33
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,880
would you be interested in having a Tony

34
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,050
Stark like experience with your computer

35

38
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,010
kids like Evan they're not clouded by

39
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,290
requirements or constraints they have

40
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,340
this sort of can-do attitude as usual

41
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,930
evan pops down into my office one day

42
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,550
and he's looking over my shoulder to see

43
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,920
what I'm working on and I'm showing him

44
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,250
how you can chat with Watson through the

45
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,480
keyboard and he said to me dad why can't

46
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,780
you talk to it with your voice so we

47
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,760
started to search around a little bit

48
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,890
about from ways we could do this right

49
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,380
we decide to order a Raspberry Pi

50
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,400
touchscreen and you can talk to it from

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,300
there we wired up Watson and an hour

52
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,000
later we were talking to it the

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,880
experience of talking to Haven is very

54
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,590
similar to an experience you might have

55
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,180
with talking to other voice enabled

56
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,330
technologies Haven helped me understand

57
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,750
ransom I like the look at Haven a little

58
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,760
bit more as a specialist it's helping

59
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,660
you specifically to understand and work

60
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,890
on cybersecurity events

61
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,900
Haven tell me about those threats the

62
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,810
most serious threat is at risk level 7.7

63
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,460
and is titled from where AirWatch

64
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,950
enrollment security bypass shall I pull

65
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,060
it up on screen

66
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,090
no thank you a company could see upwards

67
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:14,070
of 200,000 security events a day it

68
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,260
doesn't matter how many people we have

69
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,420
focused at that particular problem it

70
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,840
will never be enough to get ahead of the

71
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,160
vast amount of data that's being

72
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,280
generated cognitive technologies are

73
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,020
going to enable us to get ahead of that

74
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,910
curve by processing this information

75
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:35,460
quicker and at a large scale we're

76
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,320
always trying to think of new ways to

77
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,800
leverage Watson and cognitive to address

78
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,720
offenses and vulnerabilities

[Music]

80
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,409
I think the best of Haven is still yet

81
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:50,510
to be discovered I think the best of

82
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,629
Watson is still waiting to be invented

83
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:58,489
by someone maybe seven it would be

84
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:01,189
really cool to has such a big impact on

85
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:04,189
the way people live we're still adding

86
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:06,470
on new things and I don't think we're

87
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,349
done yet to be able to share those

88
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,689
experiences with him makes me really

89
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:15,580
really proud as a dad

90
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,410
what more can you ask for it to be able

91
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,930
to share your passion for technology

92
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,780
with your son who is equally as

93
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,210
passionate about it it's really it's

94
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:25,660
really special

[Music]

96
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,430
okay so there you go we've been working

97
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,990
on the Watson technology I'll talk a

98
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,669
little more about what that is and what

99
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:44,349
it's capable of and what we've done in

100
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:46,330
the real world with it but there's an

101
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,210
example with that I think is interesting

102
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,000
because we think of AI as a dehumanizing

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,009
thing and here you see a very human

104
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:56,229
story here's a father and a son working

105
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,629
on a technology and kids as he says are

106
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:00,460
not constrained by some of the

107
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,470
limitations that we naturally tend to

108
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,990
accept and so his son says why are you

109
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,849
typing to it why when you could talk to

110
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,370
it and so that's what they did has added

111
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,919
a voice interface so we're gonna find

112
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,379
voice interface whether you talk to this

113
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:15,940
system or not natural language

114
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,250
processing is an important part of what

115
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,530
we generally consider to be artificial

116
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,530
intelligence so a little bit more about

117
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,530
why we need this and Mike mentions that

118
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,110
in the video but I'll say some of these

119
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,360
things I know I'm preaching to the choir

120
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,639
on this we know that the threats

121
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,889
continue to increase the alerts continue

122
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:38,560
to increase relative to the number of

123
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,919
threats that are out there the number of

124
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,389
security specialists that we have who

125
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:45,370
can go work on those problems is not

126
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,349
increasing at nearly the same rate so we

127
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:50,550
have a net decline is the net of that

128
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,259
and you can see the amount of knowledge

129
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:55,630
that it takes you know when we were

130
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,930
talking about diagnosing issues in times

131
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,090
gone by it was relatively simple it

132
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,400
seemed complex then but it's nothing

133
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,360
compared to what we're dealing with

134
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,150
today this n dimensional problem that it

135
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,919
seems to be getting worse all the time

136
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:12,340
so we're asking more and more from fewer

137
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,370
and fewer and you can see if that trend

138
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,590
continues it's not the good guys that

139
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,319
come out on top it's the bad guys all of

140
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,240
those factors are working in favor of

141
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,979
the bad guys so we've got to do

142
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:26,289
something to turn the tables around

143
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:28,659
differently and this last statistic is

144
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:30,069
the one that's it's particularly

145
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:32,169
troubling to me now Mark Twain said

146
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:33,729
you've got lies damned lies and

147
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:37,180
statistics well so the you can decide

148
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,110
whether you want to trust this

149
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,259
particular projection or not but the

150
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:45,130
point is generally there we have a large

151
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,980
looming ahead of us in terms of the

152
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,420
problem space the number of

153
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,190
cybersecurity experts that it's going to

154
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,620
require in order to address the number

155
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,820
of problems that we're dealing with

156
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,860
we've got a gap we cannot make

157
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,180
cybersecurity experts

158
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,180
fast enough I mean look with current

159
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,190
technology it takes us nine months to

160
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,700
make a human so even then you've got a

161
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,100
lot more work you can't just you know

162
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,560
okay now we're gonna set you to work on

163
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,470
this problem so we're we're talking

164
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,870
about many years in order for us to even

165
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,120
start making a dent into that problem if

166
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,280
we go with the conventional course and

167
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,100
speed so what are we going to do to

168
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,080
address that I'm gonna suggest we have

169
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,390
to do a game changer we're gonna have to

170
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,100
work smarter we're gonna have to

171
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,320
leverage automation more and we're gonna

172
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,120
have to leverage other technologies like

173
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,670
artificial intelligence in order to

174
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,520
allow the number of people we have use

175
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,320
this as a force multiplier to be more

176
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,260
effective otherwise bad guys win and

177
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,500
we're hoping that that's not the case

178
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,230
so a typical security operation center

179
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,560
analyst when they see an incident come

180
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,630
across their desk they've got a lot of

181
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,580
things they have to do and this is just

182
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,650
a slight example of what that might be

183
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,350
but there's all sorts of steps that go

184
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,390
into the investigation looking and

185
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,190
seeing essentially what are the symptoms

186
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,900
what are the indicators have compromised

187
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,060
what are these things add up to what

188
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,670
does this pattern look like have I seen

189
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,040
this before and in a lot of cases we

190
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,740
have but one of the challenges we face

191
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,900
in the security area is that we deal

192
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,300
with lots of black swans we deal with

193
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,880
these one-off type of events so

194
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,690
automating response comes out to be a

195
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,000
difficult thing in most cases there are

196
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,280
some cases where you know in other words

197
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,599
put it this way if you want to automate

198
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:35,919
something you have to know in advance

199
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,200
what you're going to do you can't

200
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,440
automate an indeterminate action so if

201
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,630
you are looking at a problem that you've

202
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,510
never seen before a new attack here's a

203
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,780
new type of malware here's a new attack

204
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,330
technique it's it's going to be darn

205
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,680
near impossible to automate the

206
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,270
appropriate response to that because you

207
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,880
haven't seen it before so the focus in

208
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,050
many cases needs to be

209
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,780
automation as an assist and

210
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,580
orchestration as a way to manage all of

211
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,740
the pieces and again before it's

212
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,380
multipliers but what could we do to

213
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,600
simplify this task right here

214
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,960
the investigative phase if you think

215
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,430
about all the information that like I

216
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,950
said that an analyst has to have it's

217
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,190
increasing but who has time to continue

218
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,050
to increase their knowledge base in

219
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,020
their head if they're fighting fires all

220
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,660
day long and I don't know about you but

221
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,180
everything I read doesn't mean I retain

222
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,030
and even if I retain it doesn't mean I'm

223
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,190
instantly able to apply it in always the

224
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,350
right circumstances so those are

225
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,630
challenges with this sort of

226
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,470
carbon-based technology that we are so

227
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,760
again I'm going to suggest silicon might

228
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,180
be able to help us here so let's take a

229
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,480
look at about AI artificial intelligence

230
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,100
everybody and his dog is talking about

231
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,230
this these days all the vendors I'm sure

232
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,700
hitting you over the head with their

233
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,100
wonderful AI capabilities and so here I

234
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,140
am to do the same thing you're thinking

235
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,540
so what I'm going to try to do though is

236
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,430
at least level the playing field in

237
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,480
terms of understanding what is AI well

238
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,620
it's a lot of different things to a lot

239
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,660
of different people but we'll start with

240
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,970
a few definition definitions that we

241
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,310
could hopefully agree on so the first is

242
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,140
Webster says it's a branch of computer

243
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,760
science dealing with the simulation of

244
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,370
intelligent behavior and computers

245
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,660
sounds simple enough that nothing

246
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,420
objectionable I think about that except

247
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,390
what is intelligent behavior so it's

248
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,430
easy to say but it's another thing to

249
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,120
define we think of humans as intelligent

250
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,220
beings but I can tell you not all of

251
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,040
them are all that intelligent so you

252
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,920
know what what defines that what do we

253
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,780
can say what level of intelligence do we

254
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,080
consider it to be intelligent right

255
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,430
Oxford English Dictionary the theory of

256
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,190
and deploying development of computer

257
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,350
systems able to perform tasks normally

258
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,510
recurring requiring human intelligence

259
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,720
such as visual perception speech

260
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,130
recognition decision-making and

261
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,500
translation between languages so now you

262
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,530
start to see a little further definition

263
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,120
of what that intelligence might mean

264
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,390
through a few examples because generally

265
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,010
we would take those actions those

266
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,900
abilities to do those kinds of things

267
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,050
and say something that could do that we

268
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,330
think possesses intelligence because we

269
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,010
think it requires intelligence to

270
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,760
accomplish some of those things so what

271
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,860
does it all really boil down to AI is

272
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,200
essentially essentially involves making

273
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,820
computers more able to match or exceed

274
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,770
human intelligence in its various forms

275
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,260
by mimicking the human ability to

276
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,020
discover infer and reason notice how in

277
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,210
all of these definitions we're comparing

278
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:47,440
whatever the AI thing is to us so we

279
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,250
think we are the the top and we're

280
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,900
trying to make other systems be able to

281
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,060
do what we're able to do now when our

282
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,000
alien overlords arrive we may decide

283
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,070
that we set the bar too low in terms of

284
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,590
what was what was the ultimate objective

285
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:06,280
but until then we we don't know of

286
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,980
things that are more intelligent than us

287
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,960
so we don't have any other basis to

288
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,510
compare to so we'll continue to use us

289
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,330
as an example and what we want to be

290
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,160
able to do I think it's important to

291
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,780
think about AI as a group of

292
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,930
technologies plural as opposed to a

293
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,630
single technology so we'll tend to talk

294
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,100
about them as a group because it's

295
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,530
easier to do that but in fact if someone

296
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,020
says you know my product is doing AI or

297
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,210
I'm doing AI research they could be

298
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:37,720
doing any one of these things and be

299
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,100
very different than what someone else is

300
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,750
doing so you can see some of the

301
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,940
possibilities here reasoning and

302
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,280
problem-solving and that one's actually

303
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,220
really very hard if you think about what

304
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,220
we're talking with with a an intelligent

305
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,950
system a cognitive system that's very

306
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,990
different than what I was trained to

307
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,580
create back when I was in school and

308
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,740
dinosaurs roamed the earth and that sort

309
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,650
of thing the we were programming systems

310
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,930
and that's what of course most systems

311
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,330
are still programmed systems programming

312
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,010
if you think about it at it's as its

313
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,100
essence is taking the intelligence of

314
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,460
the programmer codifying that into a

315
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,470
procedure and then putting that into a

316
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,630
system so that it can run repeatedly

317
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,540
based upon certain inputs then give you

318
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,330
certain outputs but we've kind of frozen

319
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,310
the intelligence of the

320
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,680
programmer captured that codified it and

321
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,730
put it into the system

322
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,040
that's a program system that's what we

323
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,510
all learned in computer science to

324
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,240
create for the most part a cognitive

325
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,400
system thinks on its own and learns on

326
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,950
its own now it may start off really

327
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,440
really stupid and by the way so do

328
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,900
humans if you don't believe me go look

329
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,790
at little kids and what do they do when

330
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,620
every time they see something goes right

331
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,690
in the mouth so that's how they're

332
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,160
trying to learn and they're trying to

333
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,080
figure out you know is this edible or

334
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,620
not you know what is it like so as we

335
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,870
grow we start to learn more things and

336
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,400
then hopefully we learn everything

337
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,680
doesn't go in the mouth first although

338
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,190
there's a few then then some other

339
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,300
things that we do here knowledge

340
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,970
representation planning a planning is an

341
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,520
interesting thing that's something we

342
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,290
all take for granted and we do it a

343
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,260
million times a day simple things that

344
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,180
we plan out I'm not talking about

345
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,070
looking at your calendar I'm talking

346
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,320
about planning if I'm going to you know

347
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,020
how I walk down these stairs and I need

348
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,520
to move this way and then I need to move

349
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,960
one foot in front of the other in this

350
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,610
sort of thing it's all automatic to us

351
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,990
but there was a step of planning

352
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:38,380
involved in doing that some other things

353
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:43,150
like perception recognizing things so

354
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,790
that chair until I came here today I've

355
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,140
never seen a chair that looks exactly

356
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,480
like that chair but I've seen an awful

357
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,490
lot of chairs in my life and when I

358
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,130
looked at that I knew it was a chair you

359
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,600
didn't have to tell me that because it

360
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,610
had certain qualities that made it chair

361
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,970
like now if we were talking about a

362
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,430
program system we'd have to Train it

363
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,050
that that's a chair and then the next

364
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,370
one that comes along we'll have to train

365
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,170
that that one is a chair and the next

366
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,580
one is a chair and the next one is a

367
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,860
chair and all the infinite number of

368
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,209
chairs that we have but in this case an

369
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:17,380
intelligent being is able to see that

370
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,730
there are certain things here and

371
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,640
generalize extrapolate and in most of

372
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,220
the times were right sometimes we're

373
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,980
wrong sometimes we suffer from bias and

374
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,410
we say that thing looks like a chair we

375
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,120
go sit on it then we find out no it

376
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,990
really wasn't

377
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,380
and the thing falls apart okay so

378
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,940
sometimes we're not always right but but

379
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,770
we do those kind of judgments those are

380
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,170
all aspects creativity

381
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,670
general intelligence social intelligence

382
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,989
again we're all different in terms of

383
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,059
our own intelligence so it's not

384
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:50,859
surprising that computer science would

385
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:53,139
lead us to different areas within AI and

386
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:55,239
different disciplines now when someone

387
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:57,279
says I've got a security tool that does

388
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,629
AI it's not doing all of that for sure

389
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:04,209
so no one that I'm aware of has an AI

390
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:06,720
system that does all of that

391
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,429
simultaneously so everyone's picking out

392
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:11,410
pieces of the subfields of this and

393
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,629
trying to focus on it some of the terms

394
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:16,480
that that you'll see here are the focus

395
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,309
especially within the security space

396
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:19,959
what most of the vendors are doing is

397
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:23,279
this thing here called machine learning

398
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,439
so machine learning is a subfield of AI

399
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:28,449
and computer science that has as its

400
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:30,040
root statistics and mathematical

401
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,949
optimization so machine learning is

402
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:34,629
where the system there's two different

403
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,249
types supervised and unsupervised

404
00:16:36,249 --> 00:16:38,529
machine learning but you're basically

405
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:40,689
doing a sort of statistical analysis

406
00:16:40,689 --> 00:16:42,999
building patterns and then making

407
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:44,699
generalizations from those patterns

408
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,009
drawing conclusions from those patterns

409
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:49,869
so that's it's again rooted in

410
00:16:49,869 --> 00:16:52,989
statistics so that's but we're allowing

411
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:54,669
the system to go off and discover and

412
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:57,100
give us insights back that we otherwise

413
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,009
would have to mine out on our own in my

414
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:02,470
new detail deep learning you can see a

415
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,289
little bit different version of that but

416
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:06,880
machine learning is what most people are

417
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,619
doing if they if a vendor tells you

418
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,240
they've got security product that does

419
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,039
AI it's probably machine learning and

420
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,449
that's good

421
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,019
because we're doing as an industry a lot

422
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:18,309
of people are doing some really cool

423
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:20,260
stuff with machine learning that is

424
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,589
simplifying the job of sock analysts and

425
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,809
so forth but there's some other aspects

426
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:28,449
those are aspects of AI cognitive

427
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:30,789
computing is another type of AI that

428
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:32,409
leverages machine learning and deep

429
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:33,789
learning and some other things like

430
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:36,490
natural language processing so we'll

431
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,169
talk about that a little bit more as we

432
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:39,789
move along I think in the interest of

433
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:41,260
time I'm gonna leave these hopefully I

434
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,669
think everyone will be able to download

435
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:44,049
the slides and you can take a look and

436
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:46,000
read these definitions on your own but

437
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,889
I'm gonna flip through this for right

438
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:49,899
now and talk a little bit more about

439
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:53,710
sort of a hierarchy of computing

440
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,149
capabilities moving

441
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:57,190
more and more toward an intelligent

442
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,559
system so we start off with some really

443
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:01,570
basic stuff here you know basic search

444
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,309
capabilities pattern matching

445
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:05,950
correlation and rules most of our early

446
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,049
generation of security information event

447
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:10,779
management systems were essentially we

448
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:12,279
have log management systems where we

449
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:14,349
could do search collect all the logs

450
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:15,940
from all of our systems and then go back

451
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,639
and search on them and then the the sims

452
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,619
would come along and start doing this

453
00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:23,409
and now the better security of

454
00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:25,269
information and event management systems

455
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:27,309
are able to do this sort of analytics

456
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:29,049
that's really where everybody's going

457
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,399
when they're talking about data lakes

458
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:33,249
and mining insights and this sort of

459
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:36,279
stuff this is this is where we are but

460
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:38,859
cognition is a different thing cognition

461
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:41,019
is another turn of the crank that's

462
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,599
where the system is really thinking its

463
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,909
reasoning it's not just looking at a

464
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:47,859
data set and saying okay I think this is

465
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:51,369
the next one you know in the series or

466
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:53,799
this is the outlier that's all really

467
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,869
important stuff but there's more to it

468
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,119
than that if we're talking about

469
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,519
actually comprehending so I'll give you

470
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:03,009
an example of of something that

471
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,289
certainly when this first came out I

472
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:06,999
mean remember the early search engines

473
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:09,129
on the internet were not great if you

474
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:11,229
put in a search term you generally got

475
00:19:11,229 --> 00:19:15,219
back a lot of information and about 2/3

476
00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:16,479
of it was really not what you were

477
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:18,999
looking for and maybe the one that you

478
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:20,799
really wanted was on about the second or

479
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,259
third page of the search results but it

480
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:24,969
certainly wasn't likely to be in the top

481
00:19:24,969 --> 00:19:27,339
three well now Google came along and

482
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:29,919
revolutionized that and now most of the

483
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,119
time if you have a reasonably

484
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:33,070
well-formed search whatever you're

485
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,389
looking for it's probably in the top two

486
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:36,519
or three of results it's going to return

487
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:38,679
so we'd say that's pretty smart

488
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:42,729
is it AI is it cognitive and I'm gonna

489
00:19:42,729 --> 00:19:45,489
suggest to you that it's not for this

490
00:19:45,489 --> 00:19:47,889
reason here's an example if you put this

491
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:50,679
in to Google show pictures of everything

492
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:53,320
except pink elephants and we all know

493
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,539
what that means and what does Google

494
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:58,690
return to you exactly a bunch of

495
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:01,509
pictures of pink elephants now why did

496
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:04,389
it do that now by the way if you asked

497
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:06,279
me Jeff give me a bunch of pictures of

498
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,690
everything except pink elephants and

499
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:08,800
then that's the only thing I brought

500
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,550
you back you say Jeff you're a

501
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,350
what is wrong with you did you not hear

502
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,230
what I said but we don't we don't say it

503
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,090
because Google does some amazing stuff

504
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:22,060
in the other types of cases but you can

505
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,250
see it's missing the the does it really

506
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,720
understand what you're asking for no

507
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,220
because what it's doing is keyword

508
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,220
search it looked for and found pink

509
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,920
elephants images pictures okay I know

510
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,740
what that is here you go and it missed

511
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,170
the the intent of what their query was

512
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,560
so if we're gonna have really artificial

513
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,180
intelligence it's got to understand the

514
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,790
full intent the full context of all

515
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,840
these things that are happening it

516
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,730
sometimes we say something at one point

517
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,290
and it means a different thing than what

518
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,940
you would mean if you said exactly the

519
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,740
same words at a different time in a

520
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,160
different context and we're used to

521
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,360
understanding that context all the time

522
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,340
sometimes we have misunderstandings but

523
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,660
generally humans manage that sort of

524
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,360
misunderstanding or confusing ambiguity

525
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,910
pretty well all right how about AI in

526
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,140
the real world I've talked about the

527
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,450
abstract the definitions of the terms

528
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,700
that sort of stuff is this stuff real

529
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,570
what can it really do so IBM I think was

530
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,180
about six years ago decided with the

531
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,620
Watson system and I'm going to talk

532
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,320
about this in terms of the use case so

533
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,620
this is not we don't have a machine that

534
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,640
you can buy if you want to win a

535
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,650
jeopardy we will not sell you the Watson

536
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,890
system so that you can go win but this

537
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,020
was - - basically like a lot of things

538
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,700
if you think about when when we sent

539
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,640
humans to the moon for the first time we

540
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,260
had to develop a lot of underlying

541
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,000
technologies in order to support that

542
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,950
and there were a lot of things that came

543
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,740
out of you know the space program that

544
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,720
weren't necessarily space related but

545
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,130
they were still really important

546
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,160
supporting technologies like velcro and

547
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,140
tang I mean what would we do with that

548
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,620
Tang evidently a lot because I haven't

549
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,810
seen it in a long time so maybe that

550
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:11,170
one's time has passed but so this was

551
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,340
one of those kind of grand challenges

552
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,460
that we say if we could make a system

553
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,230
that was smart enough to win at jeopardy

554
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,360
now that would be something now why is

555
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,890
that something why is that a big deal we

556
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,610
already made a system

557
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,500
deep blue that was winning at chess and

558
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,030
beating grandmasters around the world

559
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,400
and you would think us chess chess is an

560
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,030
infinitely complex game to play if you

561
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,590
could really play that and beat the best

562
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,250
in the world

563
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,799
then you must be a super genius but the

564
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,230
system that plays chess and beats

565
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,380
grandmasters can not tie its own shoes I

566
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,080
mean it it can't do some other really

567
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,760
rudimentary things that you and I would

568
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,700
think would be expected jeopardy is a

569
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,770
very different type of problem than

570
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,280
chess is first of all in jeopardy you're

571
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,410
given answers and then you formulate

572
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,990
questions and you're as your response so

573
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,150
that's just a little bit weird the

574
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,510
second thing is jeopardy uses a lot of

575
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,770
figures of speech idioms puns rhymes

576
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,660
plays on words all of this kind of stuff

577
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,230
as a way that is in fact part of the

578
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,200
clue so if you read it literally and you

579
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,790
don't have the context of what those

580
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:22,220
kind of sort of jokes and twists mean

581
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,169
you will absolutely get the question

582
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,660
wrong so you've got to not only

583
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,640
understand literally what the words mean

584
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,470
but what they mean in that context and

585
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,710
what they're referring to in some sort

586
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,929
of twisted ways at times that's not

587
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:38,240
necessarily the way we tend to think of

588
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,010
that word but oh yeah it kind of also

589
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,049
has this other meaning as well that's

590
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:44,750
what makes it complex and then the other

591
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,030
things that make it complex are with to

592
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,890
win at jeopardy you can't just be an

593
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,350
expert on geography you have to also

594
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,720
know arts you have to know sports you

595
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,250
have to know history you have to know

596
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,740
politics you have to food all these

597
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,360
different subjects so it's so many

598
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,000
different domains it's really rare for

599
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,500
someone to be expert in so many

600
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,780
different domains and be able to think

601
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,450
that quickly because speed is what you

602
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,880
have to win with is this as well if

603
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,740
you're slow as I may be if you come up

604
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,510
with the right answer it's not going to

605
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:14,840
matter

606
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,160
they're already on to the next question

607
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,860
so you've got to be fast oh and then

608
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,870
there's this other thing if you answer

609
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:24,169
incorrectly you lose points so before

610
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:26,120
you decide to chime in you have to have

611
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,090
decided whether this is worth taking the

612
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,020
risk how confident am I in my answer and

613
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,090
do that sort of risk calculation now

614
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,320
humans do this

615
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,240
all the time in really fast moments we

616
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,799
had a system that was going to have to

617
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,690
do all of that but the hardest part of

618
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,240
that I think is dealing with the

619
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,450
arbitrariness of our language and trying

620
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,789
to sort through that and if any of you

621
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:54,470
speak you know I'm sure many of you

622
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,940
speak more than one language whichever

623
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,159
one if you were very familiar with one

624
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,049
language first when you first started

625
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:01,880
learning the other sometimes somebody

626
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,139
would tell you a joke and it didn't make

627
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:03,860
any sense

628
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,630
you translate it literally you get the

629
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,509
words out but it's not funny and then as

630
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:09,649
you start to understand the

631
00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:11,570
idiosyncrasies of the language then you

632
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,519
start to get it so Watson had to

633
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:15,379
understand all of that in order to win

634
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:17,690
so that was the challenge we were up

635
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,490
against and you would think in order to

636
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,470
win that you'd have to be pretty smart

637
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,649
and you do and in fact Watson competed

638
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:27,350
against two former grand champions of

639
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,570
Jeopardy and beat them like rented mules

640
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:36,679
it really wasn't all that close so this

641
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:39,080
was this was remarkable and I can tell

642
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,350
you this was on national TV for three

643
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,269
nights I think in a row that they showed

644
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:47,269
this at an IBM facility and look there

645
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:49,100
were a lot of nervous executives when

646
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,750
this was going on because this was our

647
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,600
chance to fail in front of the world or

648
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,919
succeed and thankfully we succeeded with

649
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,230
this and it made a big splash and then

650
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,759
everything went quiet for a long time

651
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:04,639
and then we started seeing the practical

652
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:06,649
real-world examples of applying that

653
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:08,899
kind of technology and the one that I

654
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:12,529
like best is one that was profiled on 60

655
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,029
minutes I assume you're familiar with

656
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:15,889
the show in the US a news magazine

657
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:19,190
that's weekly so this happened this was

658
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,409
profiling a work that was done at the

659
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:23,809
University of North Carolina Lineberger

660
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:25,549
Cancer Center and I live in North

661
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:28,159
Carolina in Raleigh so this is about 25

662
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,129
miles away from me so not too far away

663
00:26:31,129 --> 00:26:34,460
so that made it feel even more close to

664
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,529
home but what they did in this

665
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:38,480
particular profile is to give you a

666
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,789
background I wasn't expert in this so

667
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:42,379
I'm just telling you what I saw from the

668
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:45,590
from the story apparently at the best

669
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,720
cancer centers you know that's where you

670
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,210
end up with some of the toughest cases

671
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,460
so if someone responds to traditional

672
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,460
therapies great they go home and they're

673
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,429
in good shape if they don't what's next

674
00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:00,409
well you go to see the specialist and

675
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:01,700
they have what they call a tumor board

676
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,399
so a doctor comes and presents a

677
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:07,159
patient's case in front of you know a

678
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:09,139
room full of other specialists who are

679
00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:11,809
experts in the field and they all

680
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:13,490
discuss the case and then make

681
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,809
recommendations of what other

682
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:17,929
alternative therapies to try and this is

683
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:21,350
normal mode of operation so the thought

684
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:25,970
here was okay taking on Jeopardy was a

685
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,519
really hard problem why don't we see

686
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,860
what we can do about cancer now that

687
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,590
sounds nuts to me to even suggest that

688
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,840
that we could try to make a dent in that

689
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,639
and of course there's no cure for cancer

690
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:40,190
in in the in the abstract and the large

691
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,570
but make a dent in the way it's treated

692
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:46,820
would be even I mean they talk about the

693
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,649
impact of humanity in doing something

694
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:50,629
like that so they started working on

695
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:53,360
teaching Watson the language of oncology

696
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,090
the language of cancer treatment which

697
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:59,269
is not simple right and it turns out

698
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:02,360
that there are 8,000 new medical

699
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,320
research papers published every day so

700
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,509
if you're on the tumor board it would be

701
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:10,299
really good if you had read all of those

702
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:12,590
every day so you could apply the latest

703
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,149
research to every single case that came

704
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:17,210
in to you but we can't even read 8,000

705
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:21,460
pages a day much less 8,000 papers and

706
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,960
you can imagine what research papers

707
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,759
read like this is not going to be

708
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:29,690
trivial stuff so that's beyond human

709
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,659
capacity to do it's not beyond the

710
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:35,299
capacity of a cognitive system to

711
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,700
consume that level of information build

712
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,619
a knowledge graph and be able to apply

713
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:41,990
that that was our thought so why don't

714
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,970
we try to teach Watson this and of

715
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,009
course initially just like a human like

716
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:47,749
a child when they first start learning

717
00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:50,360
they learn a lot of ridiculous stuff and

718
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,369
say some things that are kind of crazy

719
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:54,289
and kind of funny and stuff like that

720
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:56,629
sometimes it's not funny so we have to

721
00:28:56,629 --> 00:28:58,129
realize you know it's going to take us a

722
00:28:58,129 --> 00:29:00,649
while to ramp this up so when I tell you

723
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:03,320
about all of these great possibilities

724
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,140
I'm also

725
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,940
to temper this with the understanding

726
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,830
that again think of the way a child

727
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,900
learns sometimes they'll give you

728
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,140
moments of brilliance followed by hours

729
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,010
of unbelievable stupidity it seems you

730
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,320
know how did you possibly think that was

731
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,390
a good idea to do that and then

732
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,250
hopefully if they live long enough they

733
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,020
get to you know learn from those

734
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,350
mistakes and and do better so what we

735
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,080
had to do though this is serious stuff

736
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,240
so we needed to make sure that that this

737
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,400
system really understood and was going

738
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,210
to act first of all safely efficaciously

739
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,760
the Hippocratic oath first thing do no

740
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,549
harm so they tested it studied a

741
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,080
thousand patients that who had already

742
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,150
been through the tumor board tumor board

743
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,190
had given their recommendation now we're

744
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,870
gonna see what Watson would have done

745
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,720
with these had they been presented to to

746
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,660
that system and it came out it matched

747
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,390
ninety nine percent of the time now

748
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,580
that's pretty good because I think if

749
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,929
you've got ten doctors you're probably

750
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:05,790
in a room you're likely to have fifteen

751
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:08,669
opinions so they imagine the notion of

752
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:10,169
building a system that's going to match

753
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:12,059
the collective expertise of a bunch of

754
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:14,520
doctors who don't even all agree is a

755
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,740
hard task and to do that 99% of the time

756
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,980
means this is a big deal especially for

757
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,480
all those people who won't have access

758
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,929
to a tumor board think about the vast

759
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:26,760
number of people in the world who will

760
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,040
never have their cases presented because

761
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,720
there's only so many cancer centers and

762
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,720
only so many experts so all of a sudden

763
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,120
this starts making this much more

764
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,169
available Watson found this was a really

765
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:42,240
cool part in thirty percent of the cases

766
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,010
additional therapies that the tumor

767
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,650
board didn't think to recommend yet once

768
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,270
they looked at them said yeah this would

769
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,700
be a good idea so I'm not talking about

770
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,010
let's go recommend the patient during

771
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,590
chickens blood this is stuff that that

772
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:59,040
seemed like it made sense to try so

773
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,990
that's a I think that's breakthrough

774
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,910
stuff now it doesn't mean cancer is

775
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,860
cured of course and Watson's going to

776
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,360
make mistakes just like doctors make

777
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,580
mistakes we're still and the same

778
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,640
treatment that cures one person kills

779
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,280
another one so this is hard stuff to do

780
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:14,669
here

781
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:17,610
so don't expect miracles but

782
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,590
this is progress and this is not

783
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,179
something we could have done with

784
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,520
conventional programmed computer systems

785
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,630
I remember one of the first things I

786
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,400
wanted to do when I first started back

787
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,809
in high school putting my hands on a

788
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:29,340
computer I thought this would be really

789
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,280
cool if I could build a flowchart of

790
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,720
medical diagnosis I had wanted to be a

791
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,190
doctor before I decided to get into

792
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:38,190
computer science so I thought gosh you

793
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,570
could present your symptoms and it would

794
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,910
kick out and tell you what you've got

795
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,950
and I was very naive of course we still

796
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,020
have a hard time with systems doing that

797
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,610
sort of thing because there's so many

798
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,410
different things and patients present in

799
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,600
so many different ways some people are

800
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,100
asymptomatic and some people have

801
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,660
symptoms that point to other things and

802
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,450
symptoms overlap but nevertheless so

803
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,820
that's two applications of artificial

804
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,730
intelligence to win a jeopardy and I can

805
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,860
tell you IBM's business model is not to

806
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,179
collect all the Jeopardy winnings

807
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:07,290
because that's not going to be enough

808
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,090
revenue to keep the shareholders happy

809
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,880
so we've got to move to other things so

810
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,340
then the next one was was oncology and

811
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,929
now and now we're branching out and

812
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:18,150
doing this in a lot of other spaces but

813
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,830
we're here to talk about cybersecurity

814
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,230
what does all this have to do with you

815
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,660
know could we takes a machine that wins

816
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:28,470
a jeopardy and is helping treat cancer

817
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,960
and have it actually apply that kind of

818
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,700
technology to cybersecurity that would

819
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,799
be a cool thing if we could do that so

820
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,230
let's talk about it what's the problem

821
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,390
that we have to deal with well one of

822
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,520
the things is the information that we

823
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,049
have available to us comes in a lot of

824
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:46,620
different forms if you look at this

825
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:51,179
iceberg this stuff up here on the top up

826
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,850
here security events and alerts logs

827
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,309
configuration data user network activity

828
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:59,460
threat and vulnerability feeds you can

829
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,860
take that and feed that to your sim your

830
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,179
security information event management

831
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:05,250
system and it eats that stuff for

832
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,950
breakfast why is it able to make sense

833
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:11,250
of that because it's structured it knows

834
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,470
what a log record is supposed to look

835
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,720
like coming from a particular source so

836
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,970
you can program a parser to take that

837
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,460
and say okay the first five bytes are

838
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,070
this the next 12 bytes are this the next

839
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:26,160
16 bytes are that and then it reads all

840
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,650
those in and it can start matching

841
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,179
patterns it can start looking for

842
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:31,470
correlations it can

843
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:34,200
applying rules and policies and that's

844
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,110
how Sims work so all of that stuff on

845
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:40,260
the top is current course and speed for

846
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,880
us we know how to do that it's

847
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,000
structured data now what happens if you

848
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,020
take a word doc or a PDF or a PowerPoint

849
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,419
or a website and feed that to your sim

850
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:56,610
he chokes doesn't know what to do with

851
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,929
that well whoops I mean to go there yet

852
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:03,330
what if you take an industry publication

853
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,909
an analyst report a conference

854
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:08,010
presentation let's say we take my

855
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,629
presentation from this conference and

856
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:11,580
feed that into your sim give it the

857
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,679
PowerPoint and see what it does it has

858
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,168
no idea what to do with that a research

859
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:18,739
paper written by security researchers

860
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:22,440
about a new proof-of-concept attack feed

861
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,800
that to your sim and watch it choke on

862
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,230
the other hand a cognitive system that

863
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:31,460
understands natural language can read

864
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,899
comprehend and then reason over that

865
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:36,599
data so that's a different deal that's

866
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,460
what we as humans do the problem is we

867
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,040
just can't do it fast enough because in

868
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,349
our field now there's not 8,000 new

869
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:44,879
papers every day in the security space

870
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,369
but there's a lot it's way more than you

871
00:34:47,369 --> 00:34:49,800
can keep up with believe me I'm finding

872
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,839
this out firsthand the hard way I'm

873
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,609
working on my PhD right now so I'm

874
00:34:53,609 --> 00:34:54,810
trying to read a whole bunch of other

875
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,119
papers and it's just mine knowing at

876
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,220
times to try to get through this stuff

877
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,320
and try to remember it all and then

878
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,410
create my own contributions to it so the

879
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:07,530
the point being though is that we think

880
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,830
this stuff up here may be the tip of the

881
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:13,589
iceberg that maybe only about 10 percent

882
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:15,690
of the security information that's

883
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,300
available across the universe and so

884
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,770
we're looking at another 80 or 90

885
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,450
percent of the information is in

886
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,400
unstructured formats it was designed for

887
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,980
humans to consume not for machines to

888
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,650
consume so that means we need a machine

889
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,660
that's smart enough to read like humans

890
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,970
understand like humans but not make some

891
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,830
of the mistakes that we as humans make

892
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:38,359
not suffer from some of the the the bias

893
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:41,940
issues and fatigue and just all kinds of

894
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,480
other things

895
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,240
that we have so that's that's

896
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,860
what's unique by the way I'll go back to

897
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,350
that one more time to make that point

898
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:52,320
what a lot of vendors are doing with

899
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,420
machine learning is really fantastic

900
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:59,730
stuff but it's not this they're not

901
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,500
doing this they're not you're not

902
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,290
feeding Word docs into those systems and

903
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,820
having them understand what that means

904
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,160
and then say oh yeah I read a paper the

905
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,900
other day and it looks like to me what

906
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,720
you have is a malware campaign that

907
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,400
matches what this research paper was

908
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,130
talking about that's a different kind of

909
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,140
thing that's a cognitive system that's

910
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,750
different than machine learning and so

911
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,060
that's I want to underscore that to try

912
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,580
to get away from some of the the hype

913
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,800
and and get to what what really is

914
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,780
happening so what we've done with Watson

915
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:35,280
then is take and build this the term is

916
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,619
a corpus of information it's a knowledge

917
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:39,630
base where it's consuming information

918
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,150
from lots of different sources all day

919
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,090
long and it's constantly getting smarter

920
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,710
and it's constantly growing its base

921
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,750
when we first started doing this in fact

922
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,150
we used a lot of universities students

923
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,890
to help us with it in the US and in

924
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,980
Canada and training it it's one thing

925
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,869
for it to read all of this stuff but is

926
00:36:57,869 --> 00:36:59,250
another thing for it to comprehend and

927
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,720
make sense of what all this stuff means

928
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,750
and in fact early on just like a child

929
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:07,170
Watson made some really ridiculous kind

930
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,150
of conclusions you thought malware was a

931
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,580
place I don't know how it got to that

932
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,530
conclusion but it read about this and

933
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,900
assumed that that was a location and we

934
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,670
had to retrain it no that's not what it

935
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,230
means and again think how a child learns

936
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,090
they will start to put together

937
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,430
different unrelated things in a way that

938
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,200
you didn't expect and they'll come to an

939
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,240
incorrect conclusion we correct that

940
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,090
thinking and then they move on it's the

941
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,440
same kind of thing with a cognitive

942
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,240
system so that's why you see some of

943
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,520
these ridiculous things as it starts on

944
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,190
and you're gonna see reports of systems

945
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:41,100
that don't work in the early days just

946
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,750
like humans don't work in the early days

947
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,730
either all that well but they get

948
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,830
smarter over time and that's what we're

949
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:51,180
trying to do here so constantly

950
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,070
refreshing this keeping up with the

951
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,070
information that we have but one of the

952
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,600
things that comes up when I've given

953
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,160
this presentation before somebody else

954
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,630
so what you're talking about is going to

955
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,970
replace all of us and that's not what

956
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,160
I'm talking about in fact this is what

957
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,010
I'm talking about I'm talking about we

958
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,990
have security analytics today security

959
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,460
information event management systems

960
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,520
that are good at this and people aren't

961
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,960
you know we know that we're not really

962
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,790
great at consuming mass quantities of

963
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,580
data and correlating on it you know if

964
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,380
we can correlate we can look at you know

965
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,200
10 20 maybe a hundred data points and

966
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,750
start seeing patterns but if it comes

967
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,150
millions or billions we don't know what

968
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,370
to do with that we can only see the

969
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:35,910
macro type of correlations so we have

970
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,500
systems that do this and that's where

971
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,750
the statistical analysis and analytics

972
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,400
and all that stuff comes into account

973
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,400
and helps us this sort of stuff anomaly

974
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,040
detection visualization workflow

975
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,590
priority prioritization based upon rules

976
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,670
and things like that

977
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:54,930
so that's what Sims do really well what

978
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,730
a cognitive system does really well is

979
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:59,850
this unstructured analysis looking at

980
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,770
natural language like you saw in the

981
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:04,980
video at the beginning or in documents

982
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,080
written for humans to read reading that

983
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,730
understanding it comprehending it

984
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:12,120
applying it using machine learning doing

985
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,180
QA with the system so you could ask it

986
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,160
questions like the kid was doing you

987
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,200
know with with Haven which is the name

988
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,640
of the voice interface into this bias

989
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,950
elimination I mentioned earlier is a big

990
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,560
deal for us because we will tend to see

991
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,120
what it is if we go in looking for

992
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,640
something that's what will tend to find

993
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,050
which means we may miss the things we're

994
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:37,500
not looking for now a computing system

995
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,180
though can be trained to look for

996
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,300
everything at the same time like when I

997
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,570
look at this room as my as I scan

998
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:47,430
there's just billions of billions of

999
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,680
pixels of graphical data hitting the

1000
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,380
back of my retinas it's all hitting

1001
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,960
there but I'm not processing all of it

1002
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,030
because my brain isn't fast enough to

1003
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,670
deal with all of that so what do I tend

1004
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,230
to focus on while I tend to focus on the

1005
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:04,290
people now there's not more information

1006
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,570
in the visual image in a person than

1007
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,460
there is in you know all the other

1008
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,170
things around but that's how we're

1009
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,630
that's our bias will tend to focus on

1010
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,090
people

1011
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:16,030
before I focus on chairs and that's

1012
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,940
helped us evolutionary evolutionarily

1013
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:23,290
the the our forebears who were better at

1014
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,450
focusing on chairs than humans didn't

1015
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,700
replicate so much therefore we don't

1016
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,250
have their genes so that's how how we've

1017
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,470
ended up as we are so the point here

1018
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,750
being a cognitive system is designed to

1019
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,250
do some of these things and eliminate

1020
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,630
some of the bias it can look at a

1021
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,960
situation in in a neutral way and then

1022
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,870
see what really does stand out well

1023
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:46,930
where's the place for us well it turns

1024
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,400
out neither of these technologies are

1025
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,050
really very good at any of this morals

1026
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:55,870
dilemmas trade-offs ok we're under

1027
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,370
attack what are we supposed to do about

1028
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:57,700
it

1029
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,410
remember this is a Black Swan we can't

1030
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,120
automate it we don't we've never seen

1031
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,740
this before what's the appropriate

1032
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,900
action do I shut this down because we're

1033
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,110
getting an attack well maybe in certain

1034
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,940
circumstances I would shut that down but

1035
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,830
then another certain certain certain

1036
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:14,560
circumstances shutting it down maybe me

1037
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,420
basically doing a denial service on my

1038
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,090
own organization so I don't want to do

1039
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,230
that I don't want to shut the whole

1040
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,360
business down so there's decisions and

1041
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,640
this is the kind of stuff that we excel

1042
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,100
at because we're not great at finding

1043
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,290
the needle and the haystack but if you

1044
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:30,730
give us a bunch of needles we can start

1045
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:32,500
to tell you what these mean and how we

1046
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,960
can use them so there's a place for all

1047
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,630
of us in this is the other thing my

1048
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,740
other part of the answer to that

1049
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,540
question is about this replacing people

1050
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,400
who are we going to replace remember

1051
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,650
that shortage that skills gap that I

1052
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:48,160
said we have 1.8 million people we can't

1053
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,130
afford to be replacing people we can't

1054
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:53,890
making enough people we're gonna have to

1055
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:57,310
make the people a lot more effective so

1056
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,950
that's that's not really the issue in

1057
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,900
fact it's been referred to sometimes as

1058
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,660
AI at this stage it's augmented

1059
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,360
intelligence it's not it's not a

1060
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,980
replacement it's augmenting what humans

1061
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,530
could otherwise be doing so this is an

1062
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:13,030
example of what we might be able to do

1063
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,390
take a knowledge graph that includes

1064
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:19,120
literally millions or even billions of

1065
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,840
data points of nodes of not just think

1066
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,520
about IP addresses but think about all

1067
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,069
the different items or

1068
00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:29,259
objects within that IP address all the

1069
00:42:29,259 --> 00:42:30,190
different things are running on your

1070
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,259
system that all correspond to one IP

1071
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:35,140
address and represent all of that in one

1072
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,940
big graph and then try to figure out

1073
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,849
what is which part of that is related to

1074
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:41,920
the incident that I'm seeing on my

1075
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,259
screen right now across the entire

1076
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:46,299
network and how it might relate to other

1077
00:42:46,299 --> 00:42:47,650
people's networks that are not under my

1078
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:50,440
control well this is what what we're

1079
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,989
we're doing is an example with this so

1080
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:55,989
here you see a visualization that shows

1081
00:42:55,989 --> 00:42:59,229
a malware campaign and it's showing you

1082
00:42:59,229 --> 00:43:01,569
the graph that shows just the affected

1083
00:43:01,569 --> 00:43:04,029
nodes in that so it's filtering out all

1084
00:43:04,029 --> 00:43:06,130
the other stuff that's not so important

1085
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,829
and you could with this potentially

1086
00:43:08,829 --> 00:43:11,140
figure out who did what who was the

1087
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,969
first one to be infected who did they

1088
00:43:12,969 --> 00:43:15,219
infect who are the bad actors who are

1089
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:16,900
the ones that are unintentionally being

1090
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,699
affected and sort of a drive-by

1091
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:22,809
kind of way and so forth and so I know

1092
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,039
it's gonna be impossible to read here

1093
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:25,869
but the language down here after it's

1094
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:27,999
done its analysis is it basically comes

1095
00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:30,420
back and says you know you gave me a

1096
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,369
problem and incident and I'm telling you

1097
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:37,269
I see much more here I see you know

1098
00:43:37,269 --> 00:43:38,979
hundreds of systems that are affected in

1099
00:43:38,979 --> 00:43:40,599
a larger campaign and here's what they

1100
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:42,999
all are and by the way if you if you

1101
00:43:42,999 --> 00:43:44,319
want to understand how I came to that

1102
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,869
conclusion I can show you my work and I

1103
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:51,910
can show you my my confidence in that

1104
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:54,190
conclusion because sometimes the system

1105
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:55,630
can come to the wrong conclusion you can

1106
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:57,039
look at its confidence to see it slow

1107
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:59,079
and say okay I'm not gonna bet the farm

1108
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:01,930
on this particular conclusion and in

1109
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,940
other cases oh yeah that's really solid

1110
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,140
I'm gonna look at in fact I'm gonna go

1111
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,029
ahead and read the research paper that

1112
00:44:07,029 --> 00:44:09,670
that this AI system use in order to come

1113
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:11,709
to that conclusion so that I can verify

1114
00:44:11,709 --> 00:44:13,890
it for myself so I can learn for myself

1115
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:17,529
and that's what's possible so this is

1116
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,749
not this is not fiction this is

1117
00:44:19,749 --> 00:44:22,509
something that is available today in

1118
00:44:22,509 --> 00:44:25,809
fact we've had some cases where one

1119
00:44:25,809 --> 00:44:28,630
organization claims a 50 X improvement

1120
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:32,559
in their investigation time so that this

1121
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:34,839
is and this is not isolated so now some

1122
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,940
people experience better or worse

1123
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,920
results your mileage may vary all those

1124
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,700
caveats and things like that depend

1125
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,710
on to a great extent how we're well

1126
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,770
tuned your sim system is and then how

1127
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,359
well you're able to take advantage of

1128
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,280
this what feeds have you added into it

1129
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,420
and that sort of stuff

1130
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,250
so I don't want to get into the

1131
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,930
specifics of individual products or

1132
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:55,970
capabilities but just to show you what

1133
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,829
sort of is the art of the possible and

1134
00:44:57,829 --> 00:44:59,930
if more than anything to whet your

1135
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,970
appetite for what the future could lead

1136
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:03,980
to this because we are still in the very

1137
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:08,000
earliest of days with this and you're

1138
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,920
gonna you'll see things I mean with the

1139
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,839
typical I was a gardener has the the

1140
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,760
hype curve and we hit the trough of

1141
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,820
disillusionment that's that's coming for

1142
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,980
some it's already there but then after

1143
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:21,020
the trough of disillusionment comes the

1144
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,270
reality then we start moving in a more

1145
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:25,040
steady state and we start actually

1146
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,410
getting problems solved as opposed to

1147
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:30,680
just a lot of hype and and so hopefully

1148
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,329
that's that's the area that we're headed

1149
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:34,010
to next because I think we've hit the

1150
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:38,089
hype curve part pretty strong and you

1151
00:45:38,089 --> 00:45:41,450
may think my talk just did I hope not if

1152
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:43,940
you wants a little more information more

1153
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,230
reading and things like this on the

1154
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:47,329
subject there's a website here I've

1155
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:49,640
included the link this is about sort of

1156
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,040
what IBM is doing in the in this this

1157
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,640
space if my talk I went too fast and you

1158
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,170
want to go you know a little bit slower

1159
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:59,390
then we've got artificial intelligence a

1160
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:00,740
cyber security for dummies

1161
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:05,599
and if that is too elementary then we

1162
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,710
have a paper that's essentially

1163
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:11,150
artificial intelligence and security by

1164
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:16,609
dummies and I am one of those so it was

1165
00:46:16,609 --> 00:46:18,530
a couple of colleagues of mine and mean

1166
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:21,109
we went together and put this frequently

1167
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:24,140
asked questions document together to try

1168
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,579
to and that's that's what a lot of this

1169
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:27,170
presentation is based on by the way I

1170
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:28,099
didn't have anything to do with the

1171
00:46:28,099 --> 00:46:30,020
dummies book I was the dummy on the

1172
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,810
other paper so if you want to do some

1173
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:35,030
reading and kind of get take this at

1174
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:37,609
your own pace then you can do that so

1175
00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:39,109
that's what those resources are there

1176
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:41,550
for and I think with that I am done

1177
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:44,320
