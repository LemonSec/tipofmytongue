2
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,639
yes so today's presentation like I said

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,450
we're gonna try and make it as

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,250
interactive as we can every time you ask

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,199
good questions my colleagues who are in

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,640
the room will be giving out some free

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,650
t-shirts if you didn't get one get in

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,779
here before take a smaller size whatever

9
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:25,949
its size you'd normally take to six

10
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,140
smaller this is American size this is a

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,029
large so I highly recommend that you

12
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,549
take something small now when we start

13
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,329
talking about the kind of blurring lines

14
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,390
between all of these different breaches

15
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,890
that we're seeing all the time and I

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,690
have to admit I have a nine-year-old

17
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,370
daughter and so for the last four years

18
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,960
I've been trying to explain to her what

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,760
I do and that's been the hardest

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,530
conversation how do you explain that

21
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,350
you're a cyber defender to it to a young

22
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,660
young girl so I just kind of put on

23
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,079
shirts like this and I go we're cyber

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,809
defenders we fight against hackers but

25
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,250
you know we start thinking about this

26
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,739
blurring the line between the breaches

27
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,810
that are happening you know we have to

28
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,119
think as a group as an organization as a

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,250
you know an industry that we kind of

30
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,760
need to change our approach because the

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,409
reality is we've kind of done this you

32
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,439
know kind of castle and moat type of you

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,060
know tiered of defense for quite some

34
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,490
time and saying hey this is what's

35
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,890
tradition worked for us 20 years ago ten

36
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,229
years ago five years ago even three

37
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,530
years ago there's no longer working

38
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,009
right and so we think about it for last

39
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:35,970
20 odd years I work for different

40
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,710
vendors but the last ten of that was

41
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,240
specifically working for the firewall

42
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,530
guys so X net screen Juniper Cisco Palo

43
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,439
Alto Networks and so we saw that you

44
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,640
know there was a big emphasis on

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,530
next-generation and getting ourselves

46
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,840
having a different level of context

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,990
because in security let's start with the

48
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,640
first question what do you guys do in

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,960
your firewall when you don't know what's

50
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,430
going on what's your policy around I

51
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,570
don't know I don't know run you know or

52
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,520
I don't know that's what I'm gonna do

53
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,469
right and so that's one of the first

54
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,288
tough things to do so we add context I

55
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:12,870
said okay well the context will a long

56
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,860
time ago was about

57
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,950
IP addresses well as maybe about ports

58
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,230
and protocols and then we said let's add

59
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,440
more context unless I'd be user and said

60
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,150
so instead of this port and protocol

61
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,650
we're going to move down to application

62
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,960
and so user plus application gives us

63
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,900
great context but we start thinking

64
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,730
about no news an own application

65
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,560
how many exploits are happening with

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,380
known user known application and that

67
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,900
context is just not enough anymore and

68
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,970
so the evolution of what we have to do

69
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,580
is we have to take it to another

70
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,770
different level and so just quickly

71
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,050
we're drawing out what have we been

72
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,900
doing when we see an attacker we look at

73
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,520
the how protocol application user but

74
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,989
how often do we stop and ask the

75
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:02,010
question why how many people have a

76
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,300
policy here that when someone gets

77
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,770
bricked or gets a ransomware

78
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,600
and the first thing you're gonna do is

79
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,010
you're gonna get your executive is

80
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,590
saying let's just reimage the Machine

81
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,570
all right when you remit your machine

82
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,410
what are you doing

83
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,600
any kind of data any kinds of forensics

84
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,680
any kinds everything is just so it gets

85
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,030
kind of wiped out you kind of move on

86
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,440
and you get the user back up and running

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,570
as fast as possible but think about that

88
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,600
who's the user do you ask

89
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,459
what the user does when you go and

90
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,480
reimage his machine do you like

91
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,380
sometimes you know them sometimes you

92
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,310
don't sometimes we're in big

93
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,630
organizations and you just really don't

94
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,730
know who people are and so we're gonna

95
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,440
talk a little bit about attribution

96
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,510
we're gonna talk a little bit about you

97
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,900
know why was this user targeted and then

98
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,450
we'll start talking about who targeted

99
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,030
them and what what were they trying to

100
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,360
gain

101
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,500
all right technical guy trying to work

102
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,030
out the clicker works well so today's

103
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,010
threat outlook is definitely blurry the

104
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,610
reality is this as an organ as a

105
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,890
security organization we are faced with

106
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,370
more types of attacks a larger landscape

107
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,560
now of a sudden every user wants to be

108
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,630
able to use their tablet their phone SAS

109
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,580
applications sometimes we're trying to

110
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,600
get to you developers that want

111
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,430
infrastructure and service because they

112
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,020
want to bring up these servers as fast

113
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,700
as possible to be able to deliver on it

114
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,190
we want to be agile right look as we

115
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,480
increase the footprint did we increase

116
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,190
the IT staff or the security staff that

117
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:39,760
went with it

118
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,910
most of the time no and so what the

119
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,380
reality is is that we have a bigger

120
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,270
challenge to try to be able to do and

121
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,610
the tact vector has gotten so much more

122
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,290
blurry than it ever has okay so now you

123
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,570
can see what the shirt is it's about

124
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,030
different types of actors and so what

125
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,200
we're going to talk a little about is

126
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,230
the different types of adversaries when

127
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,690
you go and wipe out a machine do you

128
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,870
know if it was random do you know if it

129
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,900
was targeted do you know if it was just

130
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,190
a hacktivists it just wants to you know

131
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,600
kind of slap up something on your

132
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,170
website or has a gripe against what

133
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,500
you're trying to do or was it a very

134
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,590
specific targeted attack by a group that

135
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,790
maybe is a battalion that all they do is

136
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,400
target intellectual property they don't

137
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,790
really care about $300 worth of bitcoins

138
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,850
they want to steal the future ideas of

139
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,880
our brightest minds right as the

140
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,100
globalization has come around one of the

141
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,210
biggest things that's happening is

142
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,650
people are trying to get that next

143
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,600
patent we see about fights for patents

144
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,790
all the time you know that you created

145
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,530
it you know all of a sudden someone is

146
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,900
be is publishing a document on your

147
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,580
patent that you're about to put out how

148
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,500
did that happen hmm I wonder

149
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:06,520
different types of attacks I was down in

150
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,110
northern New Brunswick not too long ago

151
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,349
doing kind of a conversation and anyone

152
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:14,050
speak French in the room yes yes how

153
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,889
many of you speak barrio Acadian French

154
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:19,539
and so one of the jokes that were there

155
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:22,659
was Noah and I admitted in an 8mm

156
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:24,429
petechiae some Cuban there's a techie

157
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:26,830
and saying I'm from a small little city

158
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,179
sis and you know what no one's ever

159
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,770
gonna attack me because we're so frickin

160
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,459
small that's not gonna go there oh okay

161
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,779
so I guess you're not connected to the

162
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:35,319
Internet

163
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,580
why of course yeah I am I says oh okay

164
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,979
so you mean you would be the exception

165
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:44,319
that when you connect the device into

166
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,580
the internet that you're not ports can

167
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:51,219
within 12 seconds right you say but all

168
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:52,389
right good so let's have a little

169
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:54,449
conversation about that because

170
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:56,529
geographical boundaries are absolutely

171
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:57,669
wiped out it doesn't matter where you

172
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:08,829
are you're you could be targeted so one

173
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:09,729
of the things that we're gonna try and

174
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:15,369
identify is when you got hit okay

175
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:18,069
if we don't instantaneously reimage this

176
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:20,919
we can start looking at some things like

177
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:23,559
a TTP how many of you knows what tqp is

178
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:26,740
the acronym soup a bunch of you do a

179
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,199
bunch you don't okay tactics tools

180
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,089
procedures right so how do we identify

181
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:35,559
different types of hacking groups how do

182
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:37,389
we attribute who the individuals or

183
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:39,669
which group they are through their

184
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:41,529
tactics through the tools and their

185
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:44,469
procedures they will often use same

186
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:46,839
scripts they'll often download or use

187
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,249
the same downloader as they will often

188
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:50,499
do certain things that will help us to

189
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:52,629
identify and what we want to identify is

190
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:55,779
their motivation right are they a

191
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:59,319
criminal are they an activist both of

192
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,469
them have concerns both of them will

193
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:04,419
have different motivations behind it if

194
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:06,099
you're being attacked by a criminal

195
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:08,740
group are they thinking about ransom are

196
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,559
they trying to get additional revenue

197
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,420
this is a hundred percent of revenue

198
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,790
versus a hacktivists is more about you

199
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,980
know managing ego and trying to say what

200
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,770
can we do to make them look bad right

201
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,290
and then as we move forward you'll have

202
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:27,750
stuff like nation-state attackers right

203
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,010
how many of you used Amazon by the way

204
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,039
Amazon Amazon Amazon Amazon

205
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,450
I'm thinking those that didn't put their

206
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,320
hands up are probably liars

207
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,070
and you know I'm thinking about my wife

208
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,679
not very technical you know god bless

209
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,890
her she is phenomenally operationally

210
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,630
the most effective person I know but

211
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,640
when it comes to Amazon she's a genius

212
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,790
she can order anything so I'm thinking

213
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,230
maybe we should consider getting that oh

214
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:59,820
yeah really okay I ordered it Jesus man

215
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,500
we're still talking about it and it's

216
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,420
that simple it's that fast and it's that

217
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,080
easy that is the context that we are in

218
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,920
now when it comes to you know how easy

219
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,950
it is to create malware okay so this

220
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,290
tool is the kind of the graphical kind

221
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,690
of prettier version of Amazon crime I

222
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,300
can tell you if my system engineer is in

223
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,820
the room right now and he's not but he

224
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,590
would talk about the we went through a

225
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,880
live example in one of the trainings

226
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,750
that we were okay and it is absolutely

227
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,060
scary because they'll start with saying

228
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,420
hey let's pick this exploit let's pick

229
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,820
this vulnerability and then they start

230
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,680
asking additional questions in sleep so

231
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,690
are you gonna compile this yourself no

232
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,380
can you do it

233
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,960
sure and how are you going to deliver

234
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,680
this I don't know this is once we rent

235
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,470
you out 10,000 zombies for a few hours

236
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,100
oh really okay and then what about

237
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,420
command and control what about the

238
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,550
delivery mechanisms and it's literally

239
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,200
just you're just selecting your boxes

240
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,970
kind of like what's your quantity and

241
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,800
what's your delivery method right and

242
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,330
then they compile everything together

243
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,250
they give you how many samples you want

244
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,870
so if you want 50 different variations

245
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,880
of it they generate it for you and then

246
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,430
while you're on this page okay there

247
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,870
little customer service thing pops up

248
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,450
hey can we help you

249
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,670
it's just it's mind-boggling at the

250
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,690
speed of how these attackers can

251
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,950
generate

252
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,560
new types of malware on the fly

253
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,230
dynamically this is the worst version up

254
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,880
20 years ago we used to call them script

255
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,360
kiddies this is the worst because you

256
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,730
don't even have to you know do delivery

257
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,620
you don't even have to do command and

258
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,060
control you don't have to try and pop up

259
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,500
a site they take care of it all for you

260
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,450
right and then let the editor can say

261
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,370
okay well it's going to cost you a

262
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,350
fraction of a Bitcoin you know this is

263
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,580
what what it is and then you do

264
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,860
everything for you and then two days

265
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,570
later that command in control center

266
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:01,320
that that malware the domain all gone

267
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,880
it's all completely gone and so

268
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,160
traditional signature based approaches

269
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,850
can't keep up with this anymore

270
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,050
you know we know that the traditional

271
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,550
way is not going to be able to keep up

272
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,440
with that way it is 11060 rule not sure

273
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,660
if you guys heard this but it's the

274
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,580
statistics have shown us that you have

275
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,100
one hour and 58 minutes before they're

276
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,130
gonna move lateral right and so when you

277
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,750
think about a user that moves lateral

278
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,210
he's now going to came in as mr. hacker

279
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,510
took over a device maybe downloaded

280
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,910
something launched a script launched an

281
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,940
exploit got access got privileged access

282
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,430
within two hours he's gonna laterally

283
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,860
move and will no longer have the traces

284
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,440
of who he was and where he was and so if

285
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,840
you just wiped out that machine that got

286
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,560
compromised

287
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,600
he's already still in your network he's

288
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,180
now moved laterally and going around so

289
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,050
as we start talking about the 11060 is

290
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,850
can we find something within one minute

291
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,850
can we take action within 10 minutes

292
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,760
triage and within 60 minutes can we

293
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,340
actually remediate but can we contain

294
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,840
this can remediate can we understand

295
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,640
what's going on can we go deeper into

296
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,180
what's happening that is the speed that

297
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,550
cyber defenders need to be able to react

298
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,760
to and so as we start thinking about the

299
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,340
complex hierarchies of I'm an endpoint

300
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,290
guy I'm a Windows guy I'm a Linux guy

301
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,080
I'm a Mac guy I'm a server guy I'm an

302
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,840
endpoint guy I am a archicad enterprise

303
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,800
architect solutions architect these

304
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,810
somewhere and malicious guys they don't

305
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,630
have to deal with any of that they don't

306
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,490
care about any of your corporate

307
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,220
hierarchy or your structure and so we

308
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,750
need to look at our govern our internal

309
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,740
governance we need to look at our

310
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,290
structures and say how can we be nimble

311
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,750
enough so from the first moment we know

312
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,250
something's happening in less than two

313
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,899
hours we have to contain we have to

314
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:01,180
resolve and we have to remediate how we

315
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,040
do that across complex corporate

316
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,019
structures right any questions here so

317
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:09,579
far guys you guys are open pretty quiet

318
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:10,839
and I know John's ready to throw a bunch

319
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:12,730
of shirts out so we've got any questions

320
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:19,390
here so far now we're good so time to

321
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,160
deck one minute time to investigate ten

322
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,220
minutes time to remediate contains sixty

323
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,779
that is some of the internal metrics

324
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:28,300
that we use as well on how to be able to

325
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,410
try and make sure that we can identify

326
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,690
triage and remediate in a very short

327
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,910
period of time we cheat we use the cloud

328
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,589
so we don't have very very much

329
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:46,209
structures but okay I'm actually getting

330
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:49,229
this a little quicker thank you

331
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,060
defense-in-depth the reality is this

332
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,070
okay when we think about the the

333
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,020
multitude of different layers that we've

334
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,360
built up right if you think that the

335
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,160
hacker is actually targeting coming

336
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,870
after you and he's got the time he's got

337
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,310
the money he's got the resources right

338
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,020
so I know many of you work for the king

339
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,060
of federal government if there is a

340
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,529
nation-state that was trying to come

341
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:09,910
after us they got the time and the

342
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,770
resources when you're talking about

343
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,770
complete battalions that are dedicated

344
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,680
just to doing these types of attacks so

345
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,899
okay I got a router got a firewall got a

346
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:21,520
firewall it's next generation I have an

347
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,740
IPS I have some URL filtering I got some

348
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,899
web gateways I have some email gateways

349
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,520
I have another set of firewalls and

350
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,380
another set of routers I have some

351
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,199
access control I'd ask you a question of

352
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:34,060
all those different you know eight or

353
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,010
nine different layers is there any

354
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,019
single one of those that's 100%

355
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:43,029
foolproof I would be very hard-pressed

356
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:44,589
as a vendor to ever tell you that

357
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:45,880
there's a silver bullet for any

358
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,890
technology now if you think about that

359
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,660
our adversaries have the time the effort

360
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,060
the energy the money they just need to

361
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:52,630
find the crack

362
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,830
each one of these and kind of move

363
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,620
around right I get past the router get

364
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,600
past the firewall from the firewall I

365
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,490
could get past the gateway the mail

366
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,590
gateway and keep on moving through if I

367
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,350
have enough time right and I have enough

368
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,980
money so defense-in-depth

369
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,370
definitely has some challenges now what

370
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,780
we have to try and do is be able to look

371
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,900
at in breadth how many people here

372
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,000
manage firewalls

373
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,500
Carolus guys manages one two three

374
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,940
there's got to be more than that you

375
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,820
guys are getting kind of shy on me here

376
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,660
when you start think about managing and

377
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,370
firewalls how many people actually go

378
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,960
and manage certificates on the answer

379
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,570
that they do man in the middle attack

380
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,430
right when I was in the firewall world

381
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,770
that was probably about 12 to 15 percent

382
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,560
of customers were doing men in the

383
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,090
middle so they can do a full inspection

384
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,240
into an encrypted tunnel right what

385
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,490
happens when you're not doing that

386
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,470
inspection into encrypted tunnel how

387
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,780
much your traffic is encrypted after

388
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,400
running about reports at about a hundred

389
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,630
or so customers one hundred a hundred

390
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,160
fifty customers when I used to be at

391
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,080
Palo Alto Networks I can tell you that

392
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,190
the average is probably between

393
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,350
forty-five to fifty-five percent of

394
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,450
traffic is encrypted and that's

395
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,520
increasing probably by about three to

396
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,860
five percent every single year so it's

397
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,210
we're now in the fifty to sixty percent

398
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,030
of traffic is encrypted yet only 12% of

399
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,080
the customers are inspecting the

400
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,550
encrypted traffic what does that mean

401
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,260
your front layers are just seeing Google

402
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,050
ego can't see anything can't do anything

403
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,790
with it because it's encrypted what do

404
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,320
you do with port 443 our encrypted

405
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,650
tunnel you let it go through and so we

406
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,380
need to kind of think that if all of our

407
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,350
network layers of tools are not

408
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,380
necessarily inspecting a hundred percent

409
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,930
of that traffic then we have to have a

410
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,020
kind of a final level of Defense that's

411
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,670
going to have a much deeper level of

412
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,850
breath we need to be able to take action

413
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,230
we need to be able to make decisions we

414
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,760
need to understand what's going on with

415
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,970
100% of the traffic because the reality

416
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,900
is this you're tasked with securing a

417
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,720
hundred percent of the infrastructure

418
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,150
you're tasked with a hundred percent of

419
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:05,020
the intellectual property yet if your

420
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,470
only tool to be able to do

421
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,949
only sees 40% of this traffic then I'd

422
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:11,510
be feeling pretty pretty uncomfortable

423
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,569
at that conversation right now so we

424
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,819
need to look at the unencrypted packet

425
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:17,990
we need to look at the unencrypted and

426
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,959
be able to have full context that's

427
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:28,750
where we could start making decisions so

428
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,860
I'm not telling you by the way and

429
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,330
please and I know this is probably gonna

430
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,010
go up online afterwards I'm not saying

431
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,870
that you don't need firewalls and I'm

432
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,070
not saying that you don't need to have

433
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,780
network based tools you absolutely do

434
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,580
because if we can make a decision and

435
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,929
take an action at nano seconds and

436
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:44,270
milliseconds up down the stream you

437
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,650
don't want to leave all your decisions

438
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,600
to end up at the last line of defense

439
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,039
right which is our gonna be at your end

440
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,559
point of your service but you need to be

441
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:53,059
able to harden the hell out of every

442
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:56,140
single approach that comes through there

443
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:01,429
so I love this this slide that's that to

444
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:04,610
your car so we had an audio r8 and so

445
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,720
it's a GTR now right yeah he's got a

446
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,510
couple so our CEO is also a professional

447
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,159
racer as long as on the track so that's

448
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:19,880
actually our crotch start car so we

449
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,690
start talking about breadth of platform

450
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:25,840
one of the things that we hear is that

451
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,850
there is agent fatigue people say I want

452
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,890
to throw something else on my machine we

453
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,620
know most of you guys are anyone here or

454
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,780
how many of you here are in is are you

455
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:42,530
mostly i key developers okay because one

456
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,730
of one of the most common things that we

457
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,190
hear is when you have to compile you

458
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,530
have to do a big compilation and you're

459
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,240
gonna have to run it multiple times then

460
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,860
the sixth or seven or eight different

461
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,179
agents running on the machine is just

462
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:55,039
gonna slow the hell or you're trying to

463
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,690
put everything together and it's painful

464
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,159
so we're hearing that this fatigue at

465
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:00,320
that level even though we know we have

466
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,570
to strengthen that level that is the

467
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,250
last line of defense there's a hundred

468
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,480
percent of the traffic a hundred percent

469
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,100
of what's going to go is gonna happen at

470
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,570
that level yet there's a bit of fatigue

471
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,720
I'm putting more stuff on there so when

472
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,100
we have to put stuff on there we need to

473
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,830
consider the fact that we need to reduce

474
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:19,100
our resources and then how many of you

475
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,150
here are

476
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,410
hearing continuously about cybersecurity

477
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,900
and artificial intelligence I see how

478
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,420
many guys are waking alright good so

479
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,740
most you guys are awake that's not too

480
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,200
bad alright so artificial intelligence

481
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,800
is based on models right and so you know

482
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,800
if you think about how you know big blue

483
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,910
beat Gary miss Bosque in chess well the

484
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,260
first time he would you would have tried

485
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,940
it he would got crushed because big blue

486
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,740
would have had a thousand models but

487
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,060
then we start putting a million models

488
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,290
and he started putting ten million miles

489
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,700
and you put a hundred million models it

490
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,530
starts being able to calculate all the

491
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,720
different variations and so when you

492
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,860
want to start talking about machine

493
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,570
learning you want to talk about behavior

494
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,710
analysis data becomes critical okay so

495
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,420
as an organization we were always a

496
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,670
hundred percent cloud centric we just

497
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,130
hit another milestone just recently that

498
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,960
we do a trillion more than a trillion

499
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,020
events a week now a bunch of you guys

500
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,210
probably managed Sims so you know that a

501
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,980
single event could have a thousand or

502
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,660
multiple thousands of artifacts that

503
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,520
makes a single event so think of

504
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,060
thousands of trillions of different

505
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,380
artifacts that we're consuming

506
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,730
that's what we do in every single week

507
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,100
and so we were at a conference recently

508
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,290
and one of the senior executives of

509
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,560
Amazon who was part of who we use told

510
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,260
us something that kind of blew us away

511
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,820
you do we have a lot of people here use

512
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,960
Twitter IDs Twitter yeah I'm kind of

513
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,610
so-and-so younger younger guys are all

514
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,410
saying yeah you know there's so much to

515
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,580
say yeah and that's he sure I don't

516
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,660
really want to know that you go to the

517
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,660
bathroom that's too much information but

518
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,360
Amazon told us that by 12 o'clock every

519
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,660
single day we consume more data than

520
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,720
Twitter does and WeChat does in a whole

521
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,660
year now you think about that from a

522
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,310
cyber security perspective and you think

523
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:09,330
about massive graph data model right

524
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,960
every single tweet in the world for a

525
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,390
whole year we're consuming that by the

526
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,830
time this presentation is going to be

527
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,180
over we consumed more than all the

528
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,850
Twitter and WeChat did in a whole year

529
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:23,100
so that is the model that we are that we

530
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,390
were bringing over to our artificial

531
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:30,780
intelligence agent one single

532
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,630
architecture I know about you guys but

533
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,860
you know 20 years later trying to help

534
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,510
customers get projects moving across the

535
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,460
line you guys have to go through some of

536
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,140
the most painful processes I have to

537
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,090
admit I do feel bad but you know we

538
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,500
start doing change management review

539
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,540
enterprise architecture solutions

540
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,000
architecture reviews you know risk

541
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,370
reviews and then you know we won't talk

542
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,660
about whole procurement side because

543
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,190
that's exists another another complete

544
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,810
step but by the time a project comes

545
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,300
through you've probably been working at

546
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,240
this anywhere from 6 to 18 months to

547
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,420
finally say I want this and I got all

548
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,870
the stakeholders to agree I find it

549
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,430
interesting being a sauce vendor or

550
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,780
being a vendor that kind of does

551
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,270
everything on the cloud because for us

552
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,070
once our agent is deployed you just turn

553
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,360
on the license in the cloud and that's

554
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,090
it so I always have fun I was just

555
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,260
there's a customer of ours that just

556
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,660
purchased 75,000 endpoints and we said

557
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,340
yeah I want to try this out I says oh ok

558
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,350
cool should we do an enterprise

559
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,300
architecture review this is well yeah

560
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,160
sure you checked it to the Internet yes

561
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,100
good we're done and that was it

562
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,510
conversation was over yeah all we need

563
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,890
to do is just turn on the license key to

564
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,650
enable it in the cloud and that was it

565
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,810
right when you think about agility when

566
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,430
you think about how fast those attackers

567
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:44,490
are going and we're spending you know 18

568
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,230
months to kind of prove an idea that we

569
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,870
should be going down this direction

570
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,850
they've probably came out with about

571
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,710
what 200 different types of attacks in

572
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:56,400
that time so an integrated architecture

573
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,050
allows you the flexibility it allows you

574
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,210
the agility it allows you the speed to

575
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,250
be able to adjust to dynamic

576
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,010
environments of new type of attacks

577
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:07,080
because you cannot predict what you

578
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,080
don't know but as you do know from the

579
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,810
moment you do know is two years by time

580
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,100
you go through a full procurement cycles

581
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,140
sufficient to be able to address it that

582
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,910
type of attack is probably not that

583
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,690
relevant anymore

584
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:32,920
so breath the platform combined with

585
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,030
breath of protection is a difference in

586
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:42,520
breath as an organization we've

587
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,960
protected millions and millions of

588
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,630
customer of customer endpoints one of

589
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,190
the things that our claim to fame is

590
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,990
that our organization doesn't have a

591
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,300
mission statement we have a mission and

592
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,770
the mission is to be able to help you

593
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:57,040
stop reaches so far everyone who's used

594
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,900
our product we have not had a material

595
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,230
breach today young company seven years

596
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,960
old but we've done a phenomenally good

597
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,450
job at making sure to stay ahead and

598
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,360
staying very cutting edge to what you

599
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,070
need to do to be able to stay abreast to

600
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:15,460
an attacker that is very agile that's

601
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:27,900
very fast so last thing

602
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,130
when we start talking about attribution

603
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,080
okay so let's let's get back to that

604
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,610
subject for a second I'm gonna run

605
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,230
through a use case if you guys are okay

606
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:43,870
with that user gets hacked policy says

607
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,840
that I just go in re and it reads the

608
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,400
Machine and get it back up as fast as

609
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,179
possible

610
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:51,480
that's an area one traditional approach

611
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,010
second approach would be okay hold on a

612
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,080
second let me stop for a second

613
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,510
and we'll do the first and if you take

614
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,429
anything from this by the way the next

615
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:01,780
time you go to reimage a computer if

616
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,919
you're part of that team that does it

617
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:06,640
just ask one question what do you do for

618
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,190
us I know it might sound really really

619
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,860
simple but oh um see you names Frank

620
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,909
Frank and what do you do

621
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:17,830
oh I'm chief architect here oh yeah I'm

622
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,630
kind of working on a project that's

623
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,010
that's gonna change and evolve our

624
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:24,309
company so just think for half a second

625
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:26,500
should I really wipe out that machine

626
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,289
and all the data that came with that hmm

627
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:32,230
maybe I shouldn't so when you start

628
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,730
looking other tools or other solutions

629
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:34,840
or other approaches one of the things

630
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,120
that I would do is I would look and say

631
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,080
hmm can I build out a process map and

632
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,900
understand how it got to this point

633
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,140
can I see what steps the hacker took to

634
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,470
get past here because I had a firewall I

635
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:53,230
had a web gateway I had a mail gateway I

636
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,150
had an IPS and it made it down here

637
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,940
still what do they do well it's probably

638
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,130
known user with with privileged access

639
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,710
it's probably known application that was

640
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,000
still to pass through everything anyways

641
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,950
right they were to launch and kind of

642
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,049
script so once we start looking at that

643
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:09,370
script we look at the approach we can

644
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,370
start saying hmm that TTP that looks

645
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:16,570
like a Chinese battalion that's

646
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,080
dedicated to intellectual property set

647
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,490
why don't they rent why did they

648
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,919
ransomware the machine to make it look

649
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,299
like it was some script kitty

650
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:27,010
make it look like it was random so you

651
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,840
just kind of wipe it out they didn't

652
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,919
have to lock the machine they've already

653
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,289
scraped the data they needed right and

654
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:35,350
you guys know the miter attack or the

655
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:39,940
kill chain from miter pack framework so

656
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,780
if

657
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,960
we caught at the seventh level right can

658
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,000
we say I now know that that which

659
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,560
battalion this is the Chinese I know

660
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,540
what they're trying to do can I go back

661
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,180
maybe to the second step now this kill

662
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,270
chain which is reconnaissance and can I

663
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,890
look across all my organizations

664
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,330
dynamically on the fly right there and

665
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,810
then to understand

666
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:04,870
are there other machines that are

667
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:07,570
currently trying to be infected and then

668
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,340
you say well we're ten thousand ten

669
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,740
thousand ploys in our company that's

670
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,450
interesting there's only 25 of them that

671
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,550
had the reconnaissance and then you can

672
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,840
do something like an ARP table lookup

673
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,760
and you recognize all 25 of them are

674
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,760
actually connected to that guy that one

675
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,420
user all 25 of them were there not 9000

676
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,930
not 1,000 no 25 every single one was

677
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:34,600
connected to that one single user so now

678
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,300
we start saying okay hold on a second

679
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:41,080
this wasn't random at all they bricked

680
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,610
the machine probably just to hide the

681
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,800
fact of who they really were they didn't

682
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,560
need to right now can you bring up a

683
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,640
conversation up to your senior

684
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,010
management now can you go up and if

685
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,000
you're you know public or private

686
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,920
company with a sub node probably come up

687
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,570
to the board well if he was chief

688
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,010
architect that had the the next

689
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,300
generation product where your company is

690
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,810
going to be that would be important and

691
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,550
so when you go to wipe out a machine

692
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,320
you're going to kind of kill out all

693
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,960
that data and so one of the values that

694
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,990
we bring also and any of any vendors who

695
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,050
do a cloud-based EDR think about it the

696
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,270
second that changes every single step of

697
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,860
the attack happen to get updated into

698
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,570
the cloud brick the machine lock the

699
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,830
machine take it out it doesn't matter

700
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,560
cuz the data still there I can still see

701
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,120
the metadata what they did I could still

702
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,740
understand the tracks of every single

703
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,780
step that they did to be able to

704
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,220
identify even on the machine that's

705
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,230
completely locked down I still know

706
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,800
every single step of what they did

707
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,740
that makes sense guys I think that the

708
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,420
evolution of where we need to go as it

709
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,280
as a group as an industry as you know

710
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,630
cyber defenders and the guys wearing

711
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,180
kind of cool shirts is we need to get

712
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,370
the evolution of a little bit less of

713
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,380
the how we've been doing that how stuff

714
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,170
for a long time right that port that

715
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,680
protocol that application

716
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,720
doing that stuff for a while now I think

717
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,370
the evolution of trying to get ahead of

718
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,040
this game is we need to start asking the

719
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:06,170
questions of why and then who once we

720
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:09,170
can understand the who the evolution

721
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,450
starts going and saying what's their

722
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,670
motivations what are they trying to

723
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,190
accomplish what are they trying to get

724
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:19,940
at and it'll change your direction of

725
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,410
where you're going to put your effort in

726
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,810
your energy right how much time are we

727
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:26,180
spending you know I get people asking me

728
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,950
so so Ken why do you guys kind of do the

729
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,440
whole clown thing I says well I said why

730
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,790
do you spend 50 percent of your time and

731
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,590
just trying to manage servers and trying

732
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,120
to sneak in it and try and patch and try

733
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,430
and do the updates when I do all that in

734
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,680
the cloud for you and so when you have

735
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,300
guys who are jack certified or guys for

736
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,460
a CSP certified and they're doing

737
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,890
sneakernet not the best usage of your

738
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:50,060
resources no but you're probably too

739
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,760
busy to do deep threat hunting you're

740
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,260
probably too busy to try and go after

741
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,330
the forensics so let's take all that

742
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:59,240
operational time let's refocus it unless

743
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,100
we focus ourselves on threat hunting

744
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,690
let's refocus ourselves on understanding

745
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:07,190
the why and then the who because the

746
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,320
tools the resources the conversations

747
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,670
you have if you have a chief risk

748
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,920
officer are gonna be very very different

749
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,810
when they start realizing that you're

750
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:17,360
being heavily targeted not only being

751
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,470
heavily targeted but you're being

752
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,060
heavily targeted by a nation-state who's

753
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,530
got unlimited resources or near

754
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,770
unlimited resources right and I say that

755
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:27,380
not to not to scare people but I think

756
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,910
that we need to have the right kind of

757
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,290
conversations with our senior management

758
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,720
about what are they coming after who are

759
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,680
they coming after and what are they

760
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,140
trying to do because here especially

761
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,480
here in Ottawa we're innovation engine

762
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,790
there are a lot of companies that are

763
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,400
doing very very cool intellectual

764
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,950
property how valuable is that if someone

765
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,930
is just ripping it off and putting a

766
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,280
patent out before we can finish what

767
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,380
we're trying to do and there's the

768
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,500
context of where we need to get to so

769
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,270
any other questions around that guys

770
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:11,809
