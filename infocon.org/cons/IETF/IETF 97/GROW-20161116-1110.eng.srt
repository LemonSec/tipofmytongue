an update we need to go poke the authors

grow BMP are both of our FCS today and

47
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,410
then we have other folks for

48
00:04:49,030 --> 00:05:05,799
presentations like job who's up first I

49
00:04:52,410 --> 00:05:13,570
yep oh I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't presenters stay in the</font>

50
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:22,960
box here's a clicker catch stay in the

51
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:29,590
box so me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> co can see you please can</font>

52
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:31,180
everybody hear me properly excellence if

53
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,450
somebody could close the doors<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

54
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,450
would be

55
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:53,979
I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about at raft we've</font>

56
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:58,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">been working on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cole's default ipv4 and</font>

ipv6 unicast ebgp route propagation

58
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:09,639
behavior without policies yes it's this

59
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:11,500
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we've noticed that over the</font>

60
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,320
years there<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been many BGP</font>

61
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,990
implementations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have different</font>

62
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,349
behaviors out of the box when you

63
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:22,870
configure the bare minimum to bring up a

64
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:25,750
BGP session for instance on cisco iOS

65
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,940
all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is required is that you put in</font>

66
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,400
a neighbor statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> defining the remote</font>

67
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:34,210
AAS and that's it and then the session

68
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,669
comes up and by default<font color="#E5E5E5"> iOS will</font>

69
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:42,310
announce everything it has and accept

70
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:44,950
anything it can unbirth it will accept

71
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:47,710
anything but not announced on juniper it

72
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:50,409
will accept anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> announce anything</font>

73
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,599
on XR it will accept nothing and

74
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,060
announce nothing and there's all these

75
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,250
different behavior isms and over the

76
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:01,300
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've discovered that it is highly</font>

77
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:03,970
undesirable to to be promiscuous when

78
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:08,200
you set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the session instead of having</font>

79
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:12,580
a more restrictive approach so this is

80
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:14,830
where the reject draft originated and

81
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:21,669
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> following slide shows you what</font>

82
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:25,300
reject really is this is it all the

83
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:28,270
advice is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> by default you do not</font>

84
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">accept any routes without configured</font>

85
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,820
policy and by default<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do not</font>

86
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:37,060
announce routes unless explicitly

87
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:39,340
configured to do so and one very

88
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:43,389
pragmatic example of what this would

89
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:45,070
prevent an iOS if you copy paste a

90
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:47,500
snippet of config<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you don't copy</font>

91
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:50,280
paste fast enough the session can

92
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:53,050
already be up before the session is

93
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,479
protected with configuration

94
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,280
in modern operating systems this is of

95
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:59,680
course less of an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you can</font>

96
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:04,690
do an atomic transaction with the

97
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:07,389
configuration system but BGP reject what

98
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:13,930
it does it solidifies this desired

99
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:16,870
behavior in a document before we can go

100
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:20,259
to last call they're essentially is one

101
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:24,699
outstanding question in<font color="#E5E5E5"> version</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 of</font>

102
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:26,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">this draft the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> default behavior of</font>

103
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:30,460
rejecting anything if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no policy</font>

104
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:33,550
configured apply to all<font color="#CCCCCC"> api's and</font>

105
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:36,039
subsequent a vis but then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> came to</font>

106
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:38,679
realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this may or may not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font>

107
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:41,229
desire the what we're trying to achieve

108
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:44,829
because Jared and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> approached this from</font>

109
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:47,860
an Internet routing perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nokia</font>

110
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:50,819
did an inventory of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the API CF today</font>

111
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:55,120
and it's roughly<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 api's and Counting</font>

112
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:58,540
and it is it is really a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question to the</font>

113
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:02,680
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group should this restrictive</font>

114
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:05,980
behavior be confined<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the fee for and</font>

115
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:09,790
fee<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 unicast address families or should</font>

116
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:13,089
it cover anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I personally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

117
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:16,420
that reject should be for fee<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 and fee</font>

118
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:18,070
for unicast it's easy to implement and

119
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,589
it aligns with some of the

120
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:22,810
implementations out there and if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

121
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:24,820
hit apply to any address family that

122
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:27,790
exists now and somewhere in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future</font>

123
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:31,089
it might lead to complications and

124
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:32,770
restrictions on innovation but this is

125
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:34,420
the one question I have left<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I would</font>

126
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:37,390
appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback from the working</font>

127
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:39,610
group either now at the microphone or on

128
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,920
the mailing list and<font color="#CCCCCC"> once</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we solve this</font>

129
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:44,380
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> for instance by reaffirming</font>

130
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,979
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current version that specifies</font>

131
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:52,529
v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fee for unicast sufficient then</font>

132
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,529
we can move<font color="#E5E5E5"> to last call thank you</font>

133
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:09,529
gigabyte Cisco you did mention iOS and

134
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:12,470
we are well aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the problem which</font>

135
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:16,310
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why when we designed XR we fix the</font>

136
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:19,279
problem however right we cannot<font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font>

137
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:24,619
this because it would break other

138
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:26,209
people's configs so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed you had in</font>

139
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:33,080
there a little sentence in there that

140
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:37,160
says I cannot have a separate knob to do

141
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:39,170
this no you must not require an<font color="#CCCCCC"> OP for</font>

142
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,120
the people on secure behavior yeah yeah

143
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:43,910
then that sentences they're essentially

144
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,800
as a loophole so if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> want the old</font>

145
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:49,550
behavior you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can configure something</font>

146
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:53,630
like ebgp insecure behavior or ebgp

147
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:58,520
promiscuous behavior I see some

148
00:10:53,630 --> 00:11:00,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">know-nothing yeah we're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

149
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:05,839
comply with this unless you unless you

150
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:09,589
fix that sentence you mean iOS will not

151
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,839
comply with it yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if</font>

152
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:13,760
this isn't willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide secure</font>

153
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,899
software for the internet that concerns

154
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:21,020
me yeah understood well understood we

155
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:27,290
understood this for many years<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we</font>

156
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:30,110
would let<font color="#E5E5E5"> neither a text for me</font>

157
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:32,510
personally a motivation to have this

158
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,089
document published is that at least

159
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:36,800
going forward we have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

160
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:38,350
reference to as this is the desired

161
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,779
behavior and I understand that

162
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:45,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">implementations that are no longer</font>

163
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:47,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">really updated may not comply with it</font>

164
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,209
but going forward I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would strongly</font>

165
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:56,660
encourage implementers to abide to this

166
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:59,699
document your first hi sorry I'm

167
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:02,100
eau-de-vie<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oaxaca</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Francisco</font>

168
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:04,769
and I come from a different perspective

169
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,689
our data<font color="#E5E5E5"> center customers they want</font>

170
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:09,929
simplified config so now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going</font>

171
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:18,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">to put an additional burden on them to</font>

172
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:20,129
get their sessions up yes jeff has I'm

173
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,839
strongly sympathetic with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this just like</font>

174
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:23,669
everybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the room but just like</font>

175
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,439
Jacob no we can't change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> core</font>

176
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:28,169
default behaviors because people rely on

177
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:31,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">us again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is pgp it's used</font>

178
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:33,509
lots of places<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if it's allowed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

179
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:36,480
done via a no top level knob that just

180
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:38,759
gets configured that's great if no

181
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,290
operators care to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> some way to get</font>

182
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:44,910
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are actually doing this</font>

183
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:46,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">off for packaging on things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

184
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,540
knob basically enabled in a given

185
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:51,029
package so for example you download judo

186
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,410
state by default then you'd get this

187
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:54,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">behavior is something that we could do</font>

188
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,759
as a default but our generalized

189
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:00,629
packaging system right now does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not vary</font>

190
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:03,169
things like that so we would not be able

191
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:05,279
to comply with this document if the

192
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:07,139
existing stands in there says that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

193
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,509
have you cannot have a knob it just

194
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:11,579
cannot be done if you want to figure out

195
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:15,209
some way to change that behavior we can

196
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:18,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">go then of course I'm willing to discuss</font>

197
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:22,229
it and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would also like to make it</font>

198
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:24,779
clear that in the discussion that how we

199
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:28,619
ship this in products and whether we

200
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:31,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree with the documents as it is can be</font>

201
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:33,809
to two different things because<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

202
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:37,559
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nokia and birth have committed</font>

203
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:39,539
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> applying to this behavior and they</font>

204
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:41,459
their approaches just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next major</font>

205
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:43,949
release and we'll put it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the release</font>

206
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:45,988
notes and I guess there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

207
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:48,299
various opinions on how you ship this to

208
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:49,589
to customers in the more customers you

209
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:54,358
have the bigger pain in the ass it

210
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:57,419
becomes of course no my general

211
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:58,769
observation is going to be that anything

212
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,629
that is a broad change of default

213
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:04,739
behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> does not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be this is going to be</font>

214
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:06,329
this class of problems and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

215
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:07,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> note thing whether its</font>

216
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:13,040
packaging or some other behavior that

217
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:14,389
alters n what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 346 do</font>

218
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,149
everything I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be done</font>

219
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:20,300
by everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> making somebody have a you</font>

220
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:22,699
know allow all<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4l three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> VPN for example</font>

221
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,639
seems perfectly reasonable but again

222
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:28,069
this is partially a problem as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I as I</font>

223
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:31,399
put in a different presentation blast

224
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:32,630
radius you know a fee Saffy's know if

225
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:34,190
you have to configure all three VPN

226
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,740
that's a bit of explicit configuration

227
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:39,170
and general you mean it when you do it

228
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:44,180
in the case of Internet you know the

229
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:46,519
scope is a lot broader general in cola

230
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:48,529
yeah it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great idea but I agree with</font>

231
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">previous speakers that migration plan</font>

232
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:53,089
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be considerate right I do not</font>

233
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggest putting it and release note for</font>

234
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:57,889
any vendor would actually help a lot so

235
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,990
migration might be quite painful here

236
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:01,160
yeah so it's a serious problem and I

237
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,930
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we should decouple the</font>

238
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,579
discussion yes it's a direction we

239
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:07,250
should go but we also need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think how</font>

240
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:09,920
we're going to get there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so people</font>

241
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:15,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">are not scared and not break internet</font>

242
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:17,630
even worse by migration this<font color="#CCCCCC"> comment to</font>

243
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,550
the actual question about the v4 or v6

244
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,170
so it seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that if you wanted to</font>

245
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,689
cover other address families then you

246
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,699
would also cover ibgp but since you're

247
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,620
limiting this use case very narrowly to

248
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:30,260
protecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this is</font>

249
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:32,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> current draft is totally fine as it</font>

250
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:35,420
is to just cover be 4<font color="#E5E5E5"> and 6 unicast on</font>

251
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:37,699
the point from the Dunder ebgp we were

252
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,709
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific right only applies to</font>

253
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:40,939
right so I guess what I'm saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if</font>

254
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:42,589
you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make a change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to cover</font>

255
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,180
their address families that change I

256
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:47,019
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> would have to be coupled with</font>

257
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:49,219
actually applying this for ibgp as well

258
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:50,660
so i would go either way but I'm

259
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,899
perfectly fine with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft is this</font>

260
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,610
the the other point to the vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

261
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:59,389
guess is a you know anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's gone</font>

262
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:02,689
through 12 0 to 12 2 or you know xrd<font color="#CCCCCC"> exr</font>

263
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:04,370
is used to really large major changes

264
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:06,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it's I think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of funny that</font>

265
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,939
developers would stand here and say they

266
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,490
won't do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it gets put into</font>

267
00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:13,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">RFPs and rfis by operators then they</font>

268
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,720
will do it so but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know i guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

269
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:20,980
would say people should use their money

270
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,980
to motivate thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your comments</font>

271
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:35,010
sokku in the room feels this is ready

272
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:38,910
for last call 120 so I hate scenester

273
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:42,530
there was a one specific sentence about

274
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:46,290
an op on and that is related to the

275
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:47,790
deployability and I I think we can work

276
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:50,010
on that in the next one or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks</font>

277
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:52,380
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is it's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one minor point</font>

278
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,970
that is left and I would then when

279
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,470
that's resolved then we can do law

280
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:58,800
school I think think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite close</font>

281
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:01,770
yeah get it done<font color="#CCCCCC"> before ietf one more</font>

282
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:05,010
comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a peel off work if you</font>

283
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:06,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to make a change but why don't why</font>

284
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:09,329
don't you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it be eating everything</font>

285
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:11,399
that has built<font color="#E5E5E5"> in you have to know what</font>

286
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:14,310
it's going to do is confusing right so

287
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,230
if it actually turned off all<font color="#CCCCCC"> AFIS if it</font>

288
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:19,020
had turned off all outgoing and incoming

289
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">announce</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at least or if it if it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> behaved</font>

290
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,470
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the address families i</font>

291
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:24,209
think that is better and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

292
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,890
thing you need is a knob that says for

293
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,329
this address family dude what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

294
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:31,650
turn on everything or something but but

295
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:34,470
you don't want III think it's confusing

296
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:36,000
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to know by magic what</font>

297
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,070
address families is going to behave

298
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,540
different from other address families

299
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,610
right so if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask for a</font>

300
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,930
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it consistent which is the</font>

301
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,149
one you have at the bottom right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

302
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:46,740
then it's up to the vendors to do

303
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,510
different kind of implementation but

304
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,400
basically if it turns off all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the others</font>

305
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:52,710
families<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there is a 0 turn on</font>

306
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,850
the address family of madonna's or

307
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:58,530
whatever right that could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be one of</font>

308
00:17:53,850 --> 00:18:02,879
online command then what then this the

309
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:05,490
installed base problem a diet EF just

310
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:12,990
has to listen to them and then go we are

311
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:17,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">very sorry that you have customers it</font>

312
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:20,190
should cover ibgp to write because the

313
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,720
achievement my assumption<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that what</font>

314
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,310
do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to achieve is somebody plugs</font>

315
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,440
the box<font color="#E5E5E5"> into network you power it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font>

316
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:28,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you start configuring it it's safe</font>

317
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,610
hey then it should do nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

318
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,150
network until you explicitly tell it to

319
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,149
do something

320
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,240
the link over here I agree sit covering

321
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,399
every scene is also actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple from</font>

322
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,100
a configuration automation point of view

323
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:45,590
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimizes the chances of mistake yet</font>

324
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,570
so now I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> another logic shall I</font>

325
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,809
applies that policy in this case oh it's

326
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:55,580
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be fine and so on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so just a</font>

327
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:59,269
consistent behavior is better I just

328
00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:01,519
like to echo are you Jared much from NTT

329
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:04,880
I just like to echo Peters comments in

330
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:06,649
that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've had drafts come</font>

331
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,750
through here about route leaks and other

332
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:11,059
things and this is a well-defined

333
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,519
problem this is a well-defined solution

334
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:14,870
for the problem set<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if the vendors</font>

335
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,000
are going to have such<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hard time</font>

336
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:18,529
listening to the operators on that this

337
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,460
is a real problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this needs to be</font>

338
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:24,649
fixed then it were in a precarious

339
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,509
situation as an industry if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

340
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:28,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to fix the things that we have</font>

341
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:31,129
well-defined multiple times in this

342
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:33,258
working group as a problem it is an

343
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:38,799
indefensible position to be here and say

344
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:42,409
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

345
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,750
anybody objecting to applying this to

346
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:46,519
any address family or any subsequent

347
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,610
address family can you erase your hands

348
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:52,610
I only<font color="#E5E5E5"> object if you don't change it to</font>

349
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,928
ibgp because ebgp is used in a number of

350
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:56,809
applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are very similar</font>

351
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:59,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">within the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS so people do confeds</font>

352
00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:02,690
people use EBT p-labeled unicast within

353
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,439
them selves so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expect that the eb if</font>

00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,509
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change it to affect</font>

355
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,000
other address families you've introduced

356
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:09,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">a whole bunch of applications now that i</font>

357
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,309
think that the behavior needs to cover

358
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:15,919
I'd be to be as well so we should change

359
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:17,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">it to from ASU Pete tsunami I'm good</font>

360
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,919
with the way it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is now or if you're</font>

361
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:20,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna switch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to other address</font>

362
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:24,259
families I think it needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to also cover</font>

363
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:29,870
ibgp does anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> object to including I</font>

366
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:35,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit more on the list but i think</font>

367
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:38,779
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this relatively small issue that</font>

368
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:43,610
should be able to be hashed out and

369
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:46,880
hopefully in a matter of weeks but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

370
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:49,129
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we can take it to the</font>

371
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:54,860
lists based off the input unless there's

372
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:57,530
some strong feeling Oh Jeff is final

373
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:59,540
comment I think it could be observed

374
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,879
that the real thing that should be

375
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:04,970
worked on here is less about this set of

376
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:08,630
knobs and more about how do we actually

377
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:14,930
deploy new default profiles for software

378
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:16,190
that's existing so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah like I</font>

379
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:18,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">said we'd like to get it I think we'd</font>

380
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:21,260
like to get it last call so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

381
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:26,330
try to wrap up the couple outstanding

382
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:31,010
issues and then move on be great thanks

oh it's not so sorry so in in the eye dr

405
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,789
working group over the last several

406
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,659
weeks there's been a long say 400

407
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:30,649
message discussion with a bunch of folks

408
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:32,059
louder better more more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 400 okay</font>

409
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:35,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry there's been a very long</font>

410
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:39,110
discussion some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of anger and in in</font>

411
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:42,799
faffing about for one particular issue

412
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:44,149
which is 4-byte asn and how to use those

413
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,500
if you have also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a community</font>

414
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:48,469
structure for traffic engineering

415
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,600
purposes with your customers it seemed

416
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:53,000
like during this conversation at least

417
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,260
in the eye dr world somebody forgot

418
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was there might be a set of</font>

419
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:58,070
requirements from network operators

420
00:23:56,149 --> 00:24:01,699
about you know tools that they use in

421
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:04,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network every day at least one</font>

423
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,399
looked like maybe this was just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> loss</font>

424
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:10,158
requirement and maybe there are others

425
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:13,039
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think grow probably is the place</font>

426
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,659
that should say here's a list of

427
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,309
requirements that we care about for

428
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:18,350
operating a network we at least care

429
00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:20,779
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this community's thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i couldn't</font>

430
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">come up with any others up through last</font>

431
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:23,990
night in this morning so if if i think

432
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,700
part of the thing I'd like to say here

433
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">is if other folks have things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

434
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,669
believe are important it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be good</font>

435
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:31,789
to hear about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> either on the mailing</font>

436
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:33,289
list or at the mic and then decide what

437
00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:37,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">we want to do about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this we can just say</font>

438
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:38,360
one grow person says you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

439
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,620
don't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> care to say much more about</font>

440
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:43,070
this we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to fight this out</font>

441
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:44,379
every time or will inform our vendors

442
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,760
you know through our nor

443
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,850
a vendor process and hope that that gets

444
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,830
fed back into IDR in some fashion to

445
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,060
keep track of the things we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

446
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,929
care about to<font color="#CCCCCC"> operate the network I</font>

447
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,820
don't actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what the right</font>

448
00:24:52,930 --> 00:25:00,790
answer is so I was hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody else</font>

449
00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:03,129
would stand up and say think yeah so

450
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:05,139
should grow be<font color="#E5E5E5"> do should grow care about</font>

451
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:09,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">this at all I think maybe it helps but</font>

452
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:11,560
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one person nobody else wants to</font>

453
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">stand up and say anything but now would</font>

454
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:18,730
be a time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stand up and say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

455
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:22,480
if you want job job<font color="#CCCCCC"> Snyder's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ntt I I</font>

456
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:24,580
have two comments about<font color="#CCCCCC"> two communities</font>

457
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,220
when the transition was made from to

458
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:29,889
bite a essence to 4-byte asn<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the</font>

459
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,140
either an incomplete inventory was done

460
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:34,750
which parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ecosystem are</font>

461
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:38,020
affected by death and it should have

462
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:40,210
been more obvious that the communities

463
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:44,580
were constructed to two bites and as

464
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:50,260
such would need a modification of sorts

465
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:55,120
and another risk that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen is when</font>

466
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:57,940
a relatively simple idea from grow goes

467
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,659
towards IDR they sometimes suffer from

468
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:03,340
feature creep and<font color="#E5E5E5"> where what we wanted</font>

469
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,350
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a simple hammer but we end up with</font>

470
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:09,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Swiss Army knife that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 meter</font>

471
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:13,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">wide and I've seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of proposals</font>

472
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:15,610
get completely out of hand so it if grow

473
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:20,740
can sometimes put the brakes on things

474
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:22,689
where we forcefully say stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop making</font>

475
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:25,030
this more and more extendable and do

476
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:28,500
extensibility inside extensibility we

477
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:31,060
need this one tool make one tool because

478
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:34,570
most things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> come through grow are</font>

479
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:37,330
centered around we need one feature with

480
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:39,159
one document number so even if there is

481
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:41,169
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> language barrier we can communicate</font>

482
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">with each other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's only one</font>

483
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:47,560
way to solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular interaction</font>

484
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:49,389
between you n my network and and maybe

485
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:52,240
that is something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can capture in</font>

486
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:55,030
a statement of sorts or a design

487
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,400
instruction that extensibility is

488
00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:05,510
sometimes

489
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:08,460
not what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hi Bill</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Fenner</font>

arista networks one time running area

491
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,590
director maybe when some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these things</font>

492
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:18,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">should have been looked at I think that</font>

493
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:23,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">rather than not taking things into</font>

494
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:25,620
account IDR was expecting that they

495
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:29,070
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be subsumed by other work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

496
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:32,129
other work has just you know taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

497
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:34,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">plus years and not completed and that's</font>

498
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:37,650
that's more optimism than anything else

499
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,480
I think like it this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is you know</font>

500
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,770
a straightforward problem we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going we</font>

501
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,050
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sorts of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> types of</font>

502
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:46,050
communities let's solve all those

503
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:48,450
problems at once it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that nobody</font>

504
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:50,280
said oh we need for biases in

505
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:53,100
communities it's like we need all sorts

506
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:57,120
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so and just just to be fair</font>

507
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:59,189
right that the 4-byte asn says that

508
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,169
there is this use case for sticking for

509
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:03,000
by day s into communities and that will

510
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,980
be handled by this other draft called I

511
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,710
think flexible communities which

512
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:10,200
essentially says<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero about this use</font>

513
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:11,820
case so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the time people said</font>

514
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,740
great someone's gonna handle this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

515
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,810
walk away and do my thing it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not super</font>

516
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,060
important right now so it's okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk</font>

517
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:19,679
away and do my thing but then later on

518
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,990
like it just never got picked up which

519
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:25,080
is your optimism yes right that's right

520
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:28,040
that's exactly my<font color="#CCCCCC"> point but it the the</font>

521
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:31,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">tenancy is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to let these things grow and</font>

522
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:33,659
be you know Oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll stick that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

523
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">flexible communities to because flexible</font>

524
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,300
community is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve all our</font>

525
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:39,720
problems and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's that so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

526
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:48,899
that's the simple versus complicated or

527
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:50,790
complex yes ah yeah Jolie<font color="#CCCCCC"> egli um I I</font>

528
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,190
think there's a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this that is a</font>

529
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:57,210
second system problem in the sense that

530
00:28:53,190 --> 00:29:00,330
we have this system multi protocol bgp

531
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:02,250
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially in the interdomain case</font>

532
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:06,330
is actually quite successful at

533
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:08,070
resisting innovation um and that's in

534
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,110
fact part of the reason it still works

535
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:15,710
is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are action</font>

536
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:15,709
unable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bolt new into it um and</font>

537
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:21,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">so as operators we have sort of a</font>

538
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:24,928
practical<font color="#CCCCCC"> approach to that which is that</font>

539
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:28,920
we we look at what is the minimum

540
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:34,530
possible necessary thing to employ and

541
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:37,110
we do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> um but there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a vantage</font>

542
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:42,418
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> where notionally these things are</font>

543
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:46,020
extensible and so any debate that looks

544
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:51,870
at the system as though it is relatively

545
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:54,000
flexible<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mrs. an understanding</font>

546
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:57,000
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it's actually employed in the</font>

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:23,220
oh sorry um look it was operators who

00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:24,990
defined this for<font color="#CCCCCC"> by crap in IDR so are</font>

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just confused which room you're</font>

554
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:32,250
standing in could be um this has been a

555
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:35,340
long-standing problem um if you were

556
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:37,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">frustrated i should be using the first</font>

557
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:40,049
person plural i guess if we were

558
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:43,200
frustrated by not doing it years ago

559
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:45,270
which we were the burden is on us for

560
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:50,700
not having done it years ago this is a

00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,139
solution and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could do that</font>

569
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:14,520
collectively as a group out here we

570
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:18,770
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have done a large or reflects</font>

571
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:20,930
whatever that was five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

572
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:25,660
go first

573
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:29,720
Jon Jon's glitter eye dr co-chair um

574
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:34,840
yeah so everybody who said everything

575
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:38,000
already said good things but um yeah if

576
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:41,149
in an ideal<font color="#CCCCCC"> world we you know when we</font>

577
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,290
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> s4 bite we would have done a gap</font>

578
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:45,590
analysis and then thought through

579
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:48,950
everything super carefully and then in

580
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:50,209
like oh yeah there's obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> this this</font>

581
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:53,960
deployment case that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be</font>

582
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:55,490
fixed and you know and and therefore we

583
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,950
know that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this on you</font>

584
00:31:55,490 --> 00:32:00,050
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> running on some certain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deadlines</font>

585
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:05,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">in reality</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know everybody is</font>

586
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:07,909
bandwidth constrained and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of to</font>

587
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:10,310
what what bill said which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we you know</font>

588
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:11,360
are optimistic and figure yeah we've got

589
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,679
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the hopper and it's</font>

590
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,560
proceeding as long as you know as fast

591
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,240
as it proceeds and no will definitely

592
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:23,740
get there as soon as that thing actually

593
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:23,740
gets shipped so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess my point is</font>

594
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:30,080
just if you were if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were at</font>

yesterday's<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDR meeting you realize that</font>

you've we've got another forum here for

00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:43,940

600

on that is for better<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for worse IDR</font>

608
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:08,480
is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a plea from the eye dr</font>

609
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,150
chair is to say we assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font>

610
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,430
have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit clearer focus on this</font>

611
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:16,460
one topic which we certainly consider to

612
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:20,300
be the most important topic for bgp help

613
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:23,720
us retain our focus also and tell us if

614
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:25,810

jeff has several different points first

00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:47,750
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC 4893 the one I actually did for</font>

637
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:50,630
my de esas says specified in RFC 1997

638
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:52,130
the the these<font color="#E5E5E5"> two octets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and code AS</font>

639
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:54,620
number quite clearly this would not work

640
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:56,630
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp speakers that use for octet AAS</font>

643
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:05,330
instead so the boogeyman of flex and why

644
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:09,080
communities was not specifically in the

645
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:10,520
picture and being one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the people that</font>

646
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,710
had the clue<font color="#E5E5E5"> bat applied to my head</font>

647
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,860
about two years ago about hey people do

648
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:17,120
for colon for that conversation didn't

649

happen until in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the grand scheme of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">never written down anywhere is it was in</font>

00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:27,350
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in RFC the format of that</font>

654
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,720
like juniper allow you to configure

655
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,010
arbitrary communities and you could do

656
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,129
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> without even a registered code</font>

657
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:35,690
point and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the drafts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i picked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

658
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:37,310
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was told by arbor days was to try</font>

659
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,300
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a code point specifically around</font>

662
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">again the clue back out applied i think</font>

663
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,020
was John Key's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee and finally said hey</font>

664
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:49,130
there's colon for on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right-hand side</font>

665
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:51,320
too we can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and it was a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

666
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:52,880
here's what this could look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it went</font>

667
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,380
into wide since that was the current

668
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,990
generic know Swiss Army knife that we

669
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,980
had at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time and totally agree it was</font>

670
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,660
the wrong Swiss Army knife because

671
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:02,840
that's not the primary purpose for that

672
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:04,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">feature oh so it got bogged down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

673
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:08,980
totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> agree</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that should have gone in a</font>

674
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:11,210
super feature but one of the interesting

675
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,170
observations we have from this whole

676
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,780
interaction you're asking about

677
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:17,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">requirements no it finally was made</font>

678
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:19,370
clear for colon for was the thing we

679
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,990
needed but that kept on coming up mostly

680
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:22,970
in private emails i think that the first

681
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:25,339
public version of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that conversation that</font>

682
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:29,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm aware of that i saw at least popped</font>

683
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:31,490
out an an odd that ietf not grow so

684
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:34,430
requirements didn't really leak over

685
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:37,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">tidy FB on that conversation for a long</font>

686
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:39,319
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when it finally did it didn't</font>

687
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:41,660
pop over his requirements it popped over

688
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:46,070
is hey here's this draft that actually

689
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:48,109
does this and oddly the requirement sort

690
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:51,140
of polymorph from this you know we need

691
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:53,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">for colon for for parody for 1997 to hey</font>

692
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:56,060
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to extend this now and throw</font>

693
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:58,040
an extra<font color="#E5E5E5"> colon for on top of that so you</font>

694
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:01,279
had requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> creep no already in</font>

695
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:03,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sense so there wasn't requirement</font>

696
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,600
analysis and then transmission it was

697
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:09,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">boom here so no physical feature</font>

apparently that message did not make it

708
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">through to the eye dr group for a number</font>

709
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,729
of years and that's that's a frustration

710
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:48,050
that i carry today and also lesson

711
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:49,760
learned from this is we've it's not as

712
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,680
if the operators didn't approach people

713
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,089
I remember specifically approaching

714
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,220
Jeff personally about this as well

715
00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:58,190
saying we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this problem we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need this</font>

716
00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:00,379
fixed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's certainly culminated in</font>

717
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,640
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past six months I you know or four</font>

718
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,099
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the ID our mailing list</font>

719
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:07,009
basically saying no here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> clue bat</font>

720
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:08,990
like we have to address this now because

721
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:11,089
we've like we've tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> for years to</font>

722
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:14,629
address this directly with the vendors

723
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:17,540
and unfortunately they did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear the</font>

724
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:20,180
message and understand the urgency to

725
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:22,880
the point that it became I think you

726
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:24,500
know quite a big fire drill now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for</font>

727
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,109
that I'm sorry it became a fire drill

728
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:29,450
but i<font color="#E5E5E5"> also wish that yeah we had figured</font>

729
00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:32,240
this out you know a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago and</font>

730
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:34,040
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> message had been relayed yep go</font>

731
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,618
Peter you come to the mic well<font color="#CCCCCC"> jobs</font>

732
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:39,259
running so this may be competed off

00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:44,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">quick this may be a pretty typical Peter</font>

734
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:46,700
comment but I think it's time to

735
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:50,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually start some work in the IETF for</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOR tf4 somewhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ought to do look</font>

737
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:55,399
at what are we going to replace bgp

738
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,599
would instead of starting to adding and

739
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,000
adding because it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like my</font>

00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:01,309
christmas tree where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was trying to put</font>

fall apart<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe we should start looking</font>

744
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:09,109
at all put all the requirements being a

745
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:12,410

00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:20,058
EGP to convey new fungus thing for the

749
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:29,210
present to you a draft martin smith and

thatís has stood out from<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDR</font>

753

754
00:39:40,569 --> 00:39:47,540
lack of clarity on how these communities

755
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:50,690
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> are used by operators and if we</font>

756
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:53,270
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the 1997 documents which</font>

00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:57,500
specifies classic HP communities it is

758
00:39:53,270 --> 00:40:00,770
accompanied by<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> document 1998 that</font>

759
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:02,650
gives a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> examples or some hints of</font>

760
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:05,390
inspiration on how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use these</font>

761
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:08,390
communities and this document will

762
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:13,520
attempt to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly that for large</font>

763
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:17,210
communities we all now know that large

764
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:20,660
communities are essentially 1997

765
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:26,390
communities but grown up to accommodate

766
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:27,950
the years then I've passed I may skip

767
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:32,480
over some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this in the interest of</font>

768
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:35,899
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> a key element to large communities</font>

769
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,210
is that we make a strong suggestion how

770
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,800
humans should talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the community</font>

771
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:42,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">because if we're on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the phone with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

772
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,800
other and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a language barrier it</font>

773
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:48,380
is helpful that I am not expressing the

774
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:51,080
community in say a s dot format or

775
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:54,680
hexadecimals while the receiving side is

776
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:57,049
used to it being comma separated or

777
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,690
colon separated and and the most

778
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:02,750
important part of large communities is

779
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:06,710
that we have free fields the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first field</font>

780
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:09,380
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn that is responsible for the</font>

783
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:17,150
local data to and if everybody agrees

784
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:24,020
that there are free fields communication

785
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:26,810
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be much easier between us um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

786
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:29,150
listed here some examples of things we

787
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:31,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">could not do with the classic</font>

788
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:37,690
communities and that we can now do with

789
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:39,860
large communities and their benefits in

790
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:41,960
classic communities the global

791
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:45,050
administrator field often was overloaded

792
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:47,840
by using a private asn in that location

793
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:50,960
simply because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did not have enough</font>

794
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:53,570
space so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would squat on the private a</font>

795
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,360
sense of course this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideal</font>

796
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:58,310
because in cases of mergers and

797
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:01,850
acquisitions or where you have multiple

798
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:05,570
suppliers that use the same community

799
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:08,060
but have different meaning that the

800
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:10,010
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> could fall apart so with large</font>

801
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:12,920
communities because we have that furred

802
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:15,920
field that defines whose name space this

803
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:19,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the first example is immediately</font>

804
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:22,490
resolved and it is worth talking

805
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:29,060
anything that this is now possible and

806
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:32,330
this is the desired design pattern in

807
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:34,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the documents I'm there are many many</font>

808
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:36,470
approaches to communities and this is

809
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:38,480
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them and and you will see</font>

810
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:40,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the document contains very little</font>

811
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,130
normative language because we're not

812
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:45,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to shove a mythology through</font>

813
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:48,710
someone's throat we make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it very clear</font>

814
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:54,230
these are ideas that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can eat a copy</font>

815
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:57,830
or modify or ignore the design pattern

816
00:42:54,230 --> 00:43:00,230
that we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> chosen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> follow is where we</font>

817
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:04,549
separate between informational

818
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:06,590
communities and action communities the

819
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:11,000
difference kind of lays in the intended

820
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:13,300
audience as2 914 when we send

821
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,620
communities to our adjacent networks

822
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:17,990
ninety-nine percent of the time those

823
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:20,569
are informational communities to inform

824
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:23,149
the other network this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where we</font>

825
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:25,940
picked up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route this is the relation</font>

826
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:32,590
with the entity from we<font color="#CCCCCC"> learned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

827
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:34,940
routes this is the you name it so the

828
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:40,220
intended audience for informational

829
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:43,460
communities is usually the downstream

830
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:47,359
networks that we'll use that for their

831
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:49,700
traffic engineering decisions then the

832
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:52,130
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspect that we have is action</font>

833
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:56,330
communities and action communities of

834
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:59,300
them are sent by downstream networks to

835
00:43:56,330 --> 00:44:02,840
their suppliers to<font color="#CCCCCC"> inform the supplier</font>

836
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:06,440
or vendor to perform a non-default

837
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:10,940
action if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> announce a route to entity</font>

838
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:13,040
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> default it will have no ASP path</font>

839
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:15,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">prepend a by default there will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

840
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,540
certain local preference by default this

841
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:19,700
this and this and if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change</font>

842
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:24,390
those defaults that's where an action

843
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:26,399
community comes in another

844
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:30,538
effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the design pattern is that we</font>

845
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:34,500
advocate the method of me function

846
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:37,140
parameter with me being the global

847
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:40,200
administrator the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS number who</font>

848
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:43,500
owns the namespace function being a

849
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,629
number that refers to something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

850
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:50,519
should happen so for instance a function

851
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:53,609
could be prepend twice or prepend only

852
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:56,759

as someone who buys a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> transit</font>

898
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:35,350
today we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to have a rosetta stone in</font>

899
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:36,879
our route management system to deal with

900
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:38,920
the fact that we have particular

901
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,800
intentions and we would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

902
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:44,650
those abstracted from every single

903
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:49,660
providers a particular idiosyncratic way

904
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:51,100
of interpreting this um the proposal

905
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:53,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">here is actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a radical</font>

906
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,700
improvement on that because the only

907
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:57,460
thing that I actually have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have in</font>

908
00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:00,939
the rosetta stone then if people were to

909
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:03,820
implement this widely is the proprietor

910
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:08,260
specific intentions which is the bit in

911
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:12,940
the middle because you know the

912
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:16,600
signaling around a SN is now kind of

913
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:19,960
rigorously specified so I actually see

914
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:22,120
this is like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge improvement even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

915
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,310
you don't standardize the intent right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

916
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:26,650
mean standardized intense would be great

917
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:28,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">but everybody you know has their own</font>

918
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:30,430
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of doing things and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

919
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,740
people have some kinds of intense and

920
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:36,129
not and those are not universally

921
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:39,700
supported right for business reasons or

922
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:40,430
whatever right um but yeah I like I look

923
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:43,310
at this and go

924
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:50,060
you know that's a radical improvement as

925
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:53,420
a consumer and I think it's um<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

926
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:55,640
audience for this signaling is not

927
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:58,490
actually large transit providers I mean

928
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">the saying where you learn to route is</font>

929
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:05,509
great I love that stuff from<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys um</font>

930
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:09,200
obviously but it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

931
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:11,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">by transit um you know who are not</font>

932
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:14,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily in this room so I think it</font>

933
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:24,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">is it's like a huge improvement for kind</font>

934
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:27,650
of mid-level organizations thank you all

935
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:31,790
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you will take session to the</font>

936
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:33,020
list and working group adoption can i

937
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:35,750
betray the hand who thinks we should

938
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:37,700
adopt this draft yeah we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it to</font>

939
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:39,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the list I think it's probably that'll</font>

940
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:46,100
be adopted but we're take it to the list

941
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:48,080
of always thanks Peter<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course stupid</font>

942
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:50,900
question again so would that mean that

943
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:56,920
the community functions will be an<font color="#E5E5E5"> INR</font>

944
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:56,920
registration thing no

945
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:15,730
so this talk is about many mystery<font color="#E5E5E5"> gum</font>

946
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:19,120
this talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about you r PF and what we</font>

947
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:21,460
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to achieve here is that first</font>

948
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:23,710
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all like many of us observe that you</font>

949
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:29,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">are PF should be more you big</font>

952
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:37,089
things we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at is what</font>

953
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,460
what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do can we make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

954
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:42,280
improvement so you are you RPF so the

955
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:44,290
main<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is if the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs have less of a</font>

956
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,080
concern that that they might disrupt

957
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:48,610
service for their<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

958
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:52,509
then the chances are that they may

959
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:54,370
actually deployed more significantly so

960
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:57,400
thanks for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the discussions over the</font>

last week or so on the list<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd it's</font>

963
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:10,600
of like just like a brief run-through of

964
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:16,950
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are PF is you have district</font>

00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:19,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">your PF we're only if the prefix</font>

has to have announced that prefix on to

972
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:40,000
the ISP on that interface so strict you

973

<font color="#E5E5E5">as a result of that it doesn't allow</font>

00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:07,810
as a last resort it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very effective</font>

997
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:52,490
same interface but with a much lower

998
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:57,950
priority so in that case what happens is

999
00:52:52,490 --> 00:53:00,140
it's able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to filter the in a more</font>

1000
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:02,598
logical way so multiple prefixes

1001
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:04,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">originate from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> customer one they</font>

1002
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:08,150
want they want the traffic to come there

1003
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:10,700
their way on that link<font color="#E5E5E5"> or interface</font>

1004
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:14,030
another prefix they deep rift it but

1005
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:18,500
still feasible path you<font color="#CCCCCC"> r PF allows</font>

1006
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:20,900
flexibility I mean has logic that says

1007
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:23,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay if you did announce a prefix</font>

1008
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:25,790
towards me even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not my best path</font>

1009
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:27,530
I would still allow the prefix to<font color="#E5E5E5"> belong</font>

1010
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:30,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">to that source address so that's</font>

1011
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:32,810
feasible<font color="#E5E5E5"> paths you r PF but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even with</font>

1012
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:35,000
that the ISPs are apprehensive that they

1013
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:37,819
might still deny a traffic with

1014
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,460
legitimate customer source IP addresses

1015
00:53:37,819 --> 00:53:42,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">and particularly when you have</font>

1016
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:44,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-homing and asymmetric routing so</font>

1017
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:46,759
the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is can we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do some</font>

1018
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:48,530
improvements to feasible path you r PF

1019
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,240
and that's what we looked at and the

1020
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:54,530
goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like like i said is to encourage</font>

1021
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:57,618
wider deployment so the key principles

1022
00:53:54,530 --> 00:54:00,079
of the enhanced your feasible path you r

1023
00:53:57,619 --> 00:54:02,510
PF that that we have proposed is the

1024
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:05,660
algorithm can be roughly described as in

1025
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:08,300
these four steps first of all you<font color="#CCCCCC"> create</font>

1026
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:12,618
a union<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all announced prefixes that</font>

1027
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:15,230
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> common origin a s and so at the</font>

1028
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:17,300
ISPs routers in the eighth with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1029
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:20,270
various routers you collect all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1030
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:23,150
prefixes that have a common<font color="#CCCCCC"> origin areas</font>

1031
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:25,310
and those announcements have potentially

1032
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:28,130
been received on different customer or

1033
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:32,180
peer or provider interfaces now you take

1034
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:33,390
that Union and and include that that

1035
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:35,879
entire list

1036
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:39,240
the Union on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reverse pass filter</font>

1037
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:41,790
tables on any on all of the interfaces

1038
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:44,490
on which one or more of those prefixes

1039
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:47,100
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Union were announced so this</font>

1040
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:49,470
makes it quite a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more generalized</font>

1041
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:53,430
and accurate as compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1042
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:56,640
conventional feasible path you r PF and

1043
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:58,620
because the ISP<font color="#CCCCCC"> lasts last point simply</font>

1044
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:01,129
says<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the ISP might choose to apply</font>

1045
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:05,850
step 3 across customer interface is only

1046
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:07,890
now we look at a few scenarios and the

1047
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:12,330
first one pretty straightforward simple

1048
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:14,520
scenario<font color="#CCCCCC"> two prefixes the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as1 may</font>

1049
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:17,549
originate data packets from either

1050
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:20,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">network p1 or p2 towards any of the two</font>

1051
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:24,420
isps but it announces only p1 towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1052
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:28,710
s one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> only p2 towards as2 and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1053
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:31,080
this case clearly strict<font color="#E5E5E5"> you r PF fails</font>

1054
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:33,710
because they're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data packet in</font>

1055
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:38,490
contain a source address in p1 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> p2</font>

1056
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:40,890
feasible your TF<font color="#CCCCCC"> a PF also fails because</font>

1057
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:46,259
we because nothing has been announced to

1058
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:49,379
p to 4p to towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> s2 or 4pm towards as3</font>

1059
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:51,960
lose lose your PF works but not quite

1060
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:54,510
desirable and enhance the feasible path

1061
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:56,910
as we described it would work best in

1062
00:55:54,510 --> 00:56:01,770
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's interview the next</font>

1063
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:05,930
scenario is where in this case the s1 is

1064
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:09,570
announcing prepended a deep rift

1065
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:12,450
prefixes also so it has to a prefix s p1

1066
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:16,530
p2 and it announces both of them towards

1067
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:19,140
s2 as well as a s3 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be like a</font>

1068
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:21,600
deep rift for traffic engineering

1069
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:24,720
purposes so in this case feasible path

1070
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:29,490
you RPF works of and I mean if it works

1071
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:34,169
if something else happens at s1 s2 s3 if

1072
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:36,689
they prefer a customer route at s3 let's

1073
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:42,890
look at a s2 if the customer route is

1074
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:46,589
preferred at as3 then s3 would would

1075
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:48,598
would choose p 1 as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as p2</font>

1076
00:56:46,589 --> 00:56:50,880
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I received from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a s1 those paths</font>

1077
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:53,910
direct paths and it would announce them

1078
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:56,369
both to as2 in this case in this case if

1079
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:59,489
a data packet starts off at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> s1 goes</font>

1080
00:56:56,369 --> 00:57:02,069
through s3 and ends up<font color="#E5E5E5"> at as2 on that</font>

1081
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:04,739
peer-to-peer link between a s 3 and s 2

1082
00:57:02,069 --> 00:57:08,219
s 2 will not drop that data packet

1083
00:57:04,739 --> 00:57:11,309
because you did get<font color="#E5E5E5"> p1 as well as p2</font>

1084
00:57:08,219 --> 00:57:14,969
from a s3 however if a s3 prefers

1085
00:57:11,309 --> 00:57:19,319
shorter shorter path<font color="#CCCCCC"> / customer route</font>

1086
00:57:14,969 --> 00:57:24,390
then s3 is not announcing<font color="#CCCCCC"> as3 prefers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1087
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:28,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">s2s path towards p1 and it is not</font>

1088
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:33,239
announcing p12 as2 as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result the data</font>

1089
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:35,519
packet get will get dropped at as2 so so

1090
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:39,900
feasible path it depends which of those

1091
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:43,169
preferences are applied at at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

1092
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:46,259
or a SAS 3 i'll lose your<font color="#E5E5E5"> PF works of</font>

1093
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:49,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">course but again not desirable enhanced</font>

1094
00:57:46,259 --> 00:57:51,809
a feasible path again works best in this

1095
00:57:49,019 --> 00:57:55,109
case as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more complex</font>

1096
00:57:51,809 --> 00:57:58,380
scenario and what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing here is</font>

1097
00:57:55,109 --> 00:58:01,229
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are looking at here is same s</font>

1098
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:03,989
one has two prefixes and and it is in

1099
00:58:01,229 --> 00:58:07,979
this case it is again not announcing all

1100
00:58:03,989 --> 00:58:12,329
prefixes towards all its ISPs<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1101
00:58:07,979 --> 00:58:15,419
selective realloc am announcing p1

1102
00:58:12,329 --> 00:58:17,489
towards s2 and p2 towards as3 so if you

1103
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:20,670
work it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at this</font>

1104
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:22,469
essentially what a s4 does with with

1105
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:24,539
enhanced feasible path let's describe

1106
00:58:22,469 --> 00:58:26,910
that a little bit more carefully here

1107
00:58:24,539 --> 00:58:29,759
with this example so in enhanced

1108
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:32,759
feasible path as4 looks at all these

1109
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:35,460
prefixes coming in it matches<font color="#CCCCCC"> the as1 so</font>

1110
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:38,910
they have a common<font color="#CCCCCC"> origin as1 and now as</font>

1111
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:42,599
for says<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can now apply a p1 as</font>

1112
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:45,839
well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> p2 on a customer interfaces</font>

1113
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:48,660
toward as2 as well as a s3 so in this

1114
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:50,788
case any prefix the data can can have

1115
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:53,549
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> source</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address in any of these</font>

1116
00:58:50,789 --> 00:58:56,190
prefixes p1 or p2 and they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be</font>

1117
00:58:53,549 --> 00:59:00,030
blocked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s4 whether they come in</font>

1118
00:58:56,190 --> 00:59:03,260
through those t2p interfaces or a

1119
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:06,570
p2p interface so it works fully to

1120
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:08,970
appropriately treat the traffic in a

1121
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:12,840
fair way without without blocking or

1122
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:14,910
without unnecessary blocking so one

1123
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:17,430
thing I forgot to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention is I mean it</font>

1124
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:20,879
would be nice when Artie ki and origin

1125
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:24,419
validation takes off and in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

1126
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:26,520
even if an<font color="#E5E5E5"> S did not announce prefix</font>

1127
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:28,500
that it owns but it has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> role for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1128
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:31,970
then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP can look up the rower and</font>

1129
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:34,500
add those prefixes to the list in the

1130
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:36,390
reverse pass filter and that will

1131
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:39,300
certainly make the reverse pass filter a

1132
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:41,040
lot more accurate other if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

1133
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:43,280
take a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are no stop and</font>

1134
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:46,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">like one or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two questions Thank um</font>

1135
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:49,920
capital R cos I think what you're saying

1136
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:52,710
is that instead of having nice to have

1137
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:55,710
you need origin validation for this to

1138
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:58,770
work no not necessary it was something

1139
00:59:55,710 --> 01:00:02,580
someone could school someone could spoof

1142
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:10,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">should do origin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> validation as well as</font>

1143
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:12,420
the best possible be fixed rate during

1144
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:16,080
that you can in order to eliminate the

1145
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:18,960
bad ones here so while you are you very

1146
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:21,660
green Akamai so while I'm glad you're

<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at this I think you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font>

the work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> step back a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> steps</font>

1149
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:30,780
re-evaluate the assumptions complete

1150
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:32,669
where does unicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> RPF strictmode fits</font>

1151
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:35,370
you never put unicast RPF strict more

1152
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:37,560
than a hey s boundary why did we do

1153
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:41,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">loose check because loose check wasn't</font>

01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:44,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">about doing any anti spoofing it was a</font>

reaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool why was vrf mode created</font>

1156
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:48,420
because a lot of what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking to</font>

1157
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:50,370
do right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now is vrf mode and why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did we</font>

1158
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:52,920
create flows back so you have to put

1159
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:54,900
this work within that context ok step

1160
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:58,800
back and then also realize that feasible

1161
01:00:54,900 --> 01:01:01,680
path was created because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how jtree is</font>

built versus how<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco Seth built all</font>

1163
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:06,089
right so you got to go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>
