00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:09,530
drought so it's possible we would like

147
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,620
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to</font>

148
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:16,520
initiate working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> last call before</font>

149
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:19,970

151
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:30,740
working group calls before the next

152

154
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:40,190
agreed to review on so I guess given

155
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,780
that the first question I should ask is

156
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:43,430
how many people in the room have

157
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:54,100
actually read the

158
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:56,930
version yeah yes 10 you read<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the gun</font>

and Roman and then in the email will

166
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:21,859
will do the question of whether we

167
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:26,480
believe the draft will do a consensus

168
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:30,220
call on the email um to ask if the group

169
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:37,580
believes this is ready for a last call

176
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,089
the major changes that we've made in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

177
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">last two draft updates to rolling so</font>

178
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:06,800
that everyone's up to date as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as</font>

179
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,209
covered like the major review questions

180
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,029
and issues that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have left to cover</font>

181
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:15,319
until we do the working group last last

182
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:16,459
call and get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> finished up so</font>

183
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,930
first of all it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of a wall</font>

184
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:20,510
of text but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try and just</font>

185
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:23,150
go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as concisely as we can</font>

186
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:25,400
these are the major changes that have

187
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:29,540
happened in the 04 update of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft</font>

188
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:32,029
from 03 we did a decent<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of work</font>

189
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,310
in the front matter of the document in

190
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:39,020
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> background and motivation section</font>

191
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:41,779
which was quite lengthy and we boiled it

192
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,890
down with the same kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of intent but</font>

193
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:46,160
just in a way that's a little bit more

194
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:48,920
concise one of the major changes we made

195
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,920
was we combined authentication and

196
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,569
authorization and more or less moved all

197
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,930
the normative requirements out of the

198
00:14:53,570 --> 00:15:00,140
document and we are intending to

199
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:01,849
a separate document that will contain

200
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:06,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">the requirements for authentication and</font>

201
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:09,860
authorization the TLS requirements that

202
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:12,020
were originally<font color="#CCCCCC"> enrollee were iterated</font>

203
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,660
and expanded based on the TLS

204
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,970
requirements from RFC 75 89 they had a

205
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:20,180
TLS requirements section that had a

206
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:24,580
format that was a useful a template for

207
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:27,199
us the forward slash resource

208
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:29,540
requirements were expanded as to what

209
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> expected responses are for sending</font>

210
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,709
requests to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the forward slash operator</font>

211
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:38,449
the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> response codes are now set</font>

212
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:42,319
normatively the link relationships were

213
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:44,360
basically a centralized and moved into a

214
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,649
more sensical kind of place all in one

215
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">place and everything else references</font>

216
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:48,560
this section that should make it a

217
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,819
little bit more clearer and make a

218
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easier for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reference we want</font>

219
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,610
the document to be referenceable as

220
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:54,350
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on its be able to just</font>

221
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,730
pull it up click the link at the top and

222
00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:00,290
see where all these things are so now

223
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:03,140
there's one table for all that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rolly</font>

224
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:05,510
format element is defined which is a new

225
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:08,860
element that's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> extension to atom</font>

226
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:11,450
syndication and<font color="#CCCCCC"> rowley format holds</font>

227
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:15,080
information about the data format of the

228
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:18,250
content the actual schema and definition

229
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:20,600
for that was added in this version ah

230
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,070
the search requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like</font>

231
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,270
authentication authorization the

232
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,640
normative search requirements were

233
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,620
removed that is intended to be added in

234
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,860
a separate<font color="#CCCCCC"> rowley search draft if you</font>

235
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:34,810
will at a later date as that was deemed

236
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:39,470
out of scope for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the core document the</font>

237
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:41,810
extension points<font color="#CCCCCC"> rowley format being one</font>

238
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:44,300
of them the several<font color="#E5E5E5"> other extension</font>

239
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:47,859
points like category and Link relations

240
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:50,029
those extension points are described in

241
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,320
much greater detail at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

242
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:52,700
document there's a whole section that

243
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,029
describes how to use those extension

244
00:16:52,700 --> 00:17:00,350
points and what they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> accomplish</font>

245
00:16:56,029 --> 00:17:03,410
and the ionic registration section which

246
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:05,630
was unfinished it was all too dude<font color="#E5E5E5"> an in</font>

247
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,949
the 03 version was completed and filled

248
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">out and all those registration should</font>

249
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:10,760
not be complete for establishing all the

250
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:13,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">ANA tables that we use for extensions</font>

251
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,650
and then the yeah as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned earlier</font>

252
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:18,219
that the actual schema was added for

253
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,540
Rowley format so this was the 04 version

254
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:26,870
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a lot of major normative</font>

255
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:31,430
changes not too long after a four we did

256
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:33,050
an 05 version that contained a few more

257
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:37,160
changes that we wanted to get in before

258
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:38,450
this meeting we expanded<font color="#CCCCCC"> the terminology</font>

259
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,550
section at the beginning of the document

260
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:43,280
in order to define all of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rowley</font>

261
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,480
specific terminology in one place

262
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,800
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of defining it throughout the</font>

263
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">document the atom pub category document</font>

264
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,720
is a document that allows for a

265
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:55,840
centralized location of all the

266
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,910
categories that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly server provides</font>

267
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,620
that was originally not required we

268
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:03,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">decided that it was valuable for a</font>

269
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:07,070
server to basically report on all the

270
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,629
categories that it provides so we added

271
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,270
that in as a requirement now there's a

272
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,650
standardized location a client can come

273
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,260
and get the category document<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

274
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:17,690
instantly know what the given<font color="#E5E5E5"> rowley</font>

275
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,610
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually what information types</font>

276
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:21,710
and categories it provides it's a

277
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:24,020
normative requirement now general

278
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,820
editing I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make things as</font>

279
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,129
clear and concise as possible so that

280
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:30,590
the document is is useful to

281
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:34,880
implementers as possible and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just gets</font>

282
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:37,850
right to the meat of it the format

283
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,340
parameter type the was in 04 for the

284
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:42,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">iono</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> registration that is not being</font>

285
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,449
registered in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ana section so that</font>

286
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:47,750
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a extraneous text that was</font>

287
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:53,500
removed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the 04 version contained</font>

288
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:55,730
like a 35-page relax<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> g schema that</font>

289
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,490
included all of atom syndication and all

290
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:01,700
of adam pub and that was unnecessary so

291
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:04,220
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> removed the full schema and now only</font>

292
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,480
include the relevant pieces of the

293
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,700
schema that have actually changed

294
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,380
throughout<font color="#CCCCCC"> the document it makes a lot</font>

295
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,600
shorter easier to print out you have to

296
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,250
print out the whole thing so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

297
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,290
summary of the major changes that we

298
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:18,080
made in the 04 and 05 versions which is

299
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:21,590
the documents current version we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

300
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:24,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> changes pending in the github that</font>

301
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,199
for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a planned 06 version but there</font>

302
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,010
are

303
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:30,889
most entirely editing clarity<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

304
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:35,059
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of small edits nothing really of</font>

305
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:36,740
note so with that there are a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

306
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:39,830
left that we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do to get this done</font>

307
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:43,250
these three review questions that we

308
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:44,629
have up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are less of an outstanding</font>

309
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,389
issue and more of things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

310
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,169
get reviewed before we push this out

311
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:50,689
hopefully these will be answered by

312
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:52,130
people reviewing the document so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

313
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:55,970
do review keep an eye out<font color="#CCCCCC"> for these</font>

314
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:58,250
things are normative and informative

315
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:00,529
references need to we need to check and

316
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,029
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the reference is actually</font>

317
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:05,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the place that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they belong whether</font>

318
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:08,450
they're informative or normative the<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML</font>

319
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:10,399
snippets in examples we have tried very

320
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">hard to keep those up to date with as</font>

321
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:14,600
the document requirements have changed

322
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:17,090
but we would like those to be validated

323
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:20,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">against the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly schema hopefully in</font>

324
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,889
the future we can build a validator or

325
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,600
just use<font color="#CCCCCC"> some kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of validation to</font>

326
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:26,809
actually make sure that our examples are

327
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,209
fully valid it's the hope there and this

328
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:30,500
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question that we hope that there</font>

329
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,210
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> people here in the room or in the</font>

330
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,669
mailing list or a mile in general that

331
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:38,240
can help<font color="#E5E5E5"> us with the security side of</font>

332
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:39,889
things we have TLS requirements and we

333
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,179
have a security considerations section

334
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:42,949
we need some people who are

335
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:45,409
knowledgeable about<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things to read</font>

336
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:48,799
through some experts in TLS or just in

337
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:51,139
the HTTP security in general and give us

338
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">feedback on those security sections and</font>

339
00:20:51,139 --> 00:20:57,830
let us know if if this is what what you

340
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:00,019
expect so with that we do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font>

341
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:03,620
substantive issues that we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

342
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:07,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the group so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

344
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:12,429
light while we were working on the sea

345
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:14,210
cert extension document there are

346
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:18,080
identifying and characterizing

347
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:19,730
properties of data formats that don't

348
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,500
belong in<font color="#CCCCCC"> our current</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extension points</font>

349
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:26,389
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have linked relations we have</font>

350
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:28,130
categories for example in IO def ID is a

351
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:29,719
really important property that could be

352
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful for somebody trying to get</font>

information off of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly server</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

354
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,330
get me this<font color="#CCCCCC"> iof ID the only way for them</font>

355
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,330
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually download the</font>

356
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:41,449
content and then search it if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

357
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:45,049
some way<font color="#E5E5E5"> of arbitrarily exposing these</font>

358
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:47,330
very important attributes out of a data

359
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:48,649
model out of the attacked content that

360
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:51,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">could save a ton of time for people</font>

361
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:53,418
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> search so there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are a couple</font>

362
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:55,039
options to trying to solve this problem

363
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:58,100
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have some examples</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

364
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:00,408
the proposal<font color="#CCCCCC"> for each so the first</font>

365
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:04,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">option is to create a new extension</font>

366
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:08,059
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> rowley property which is a fairly</font>

367
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:10,220
free form property that is constrained

368
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:12,080
in ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it reasonable and as</font>

369
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,049
safe as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is otherwise</font>

370
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,750
fairly unrestrictive that would allow

371
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:21,830
the exposure of these important elements

372
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:26,210
for whoever may need them and then

373
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:29,600
register those properties so that

374
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:32,000
they're tracked and understood so that

375
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,699
for example the<font color="#E5E5E5"> see sort extension</font>

376
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,200
document may register in an eye on a

377
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:41,629
table a ID and maybe date which are two

378
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,120
important attributes of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> io def</font>

379
00:22:41,629 --> 00:22:48,039
document that are not exposed belen any

380
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:50,479
other way the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> option is to</font>

381
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:52,690
basically require any time that you want

382
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:57,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that just it has to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> local</font>

383
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:59,960
definition instead some kind of locally

384
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">named spaced I o def element that you</font>

385
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,480
add in<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to expose that information</font>

386
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,320
so here are<font color="#CCCCCC"> two examples of option</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

387
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:16,010
and option to use the laser pointer

388
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">things pretty cool so uh option one here</font>

389
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:20,419
this is the relevant section there's an

390
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,658
actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> rowley property element with a</font>

391
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:26,000
scheme so<font color="#CCCCCC"> roll ec cert I oh def this is</font>

392
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:28,039
a Stiga scheme that would be established

393
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,230
by the extension<font color="#E5E5E5"> documents Oh Rollie</font>

394
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:32,470
Caesar would establish this scheme and

395
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:36,080
that scheme contains a number of names

396
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:38,750
and in that document that defines those

397
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,210
it defines the actual semantic meaning

398
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:43,730
of this information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the actual</font>

399
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:45,679
data goes in the content of the tack so

400
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,139
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to expose the iof ID that</font>

401
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:51,190
way this is what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might look like</font>

402
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:51,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">and again for date</font>

403
00:23:52,229 --> 00:23:57,099
and there's contents there's elements

404
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:58,899
alighted from here there would be a

405
00:23:57,099 --> 00:24:02,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">content here where the iof actually is</font>

406
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:04,359
but so this would allow you to get to I

407
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:06,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">o def ID and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> o def date without having</font>

408
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:10,478
to download the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I def document it's good</font>

409
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:16,599
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> option to these are locally</font>

410
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:18,820
defined name spaces which are shorter

411
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:20,678
and element name but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of</font>

412
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,059
compatibility issues because these are

413
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:25,059
just locally defined so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

414
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:27,219
really any way of easily communicating

415
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:28,899
that to a public distribution which is

416
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:30,639
what really one of rollies major use

417
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:32,529
cases is this public distribution use

418
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:34,988
case and if everything's locally defined

419
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:37,899
doesn't really mean anything and rowley

420
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:44,349
is going to just ignore those fields in

421
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:47,649
most of the cases so so option one an

422
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:49,299
option<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a little ribbon on here</font>

423
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:51,689
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what I'm doing is</font>

424
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:53,918
this the time that we might call for

425
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:58,330
option one or option two what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are people</font>

426
00:24:53,919 --> 00:25:01,359
feeling about this um do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we call for</font>

427
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:04,269
consensus now on this issue are no you

428
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:06,210
just get opinions opinions are there any

429
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:12,399
strong opinions one way or another

430
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:14,739
between option<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> option two we</font>

431
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:15,908
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> hum and ask for him I have not had</font>

432
00:25:14,739 --> 00:25:25,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">a home the whole week I've been here</font>

433
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:26,859
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very disappointing okay well let</font>

434
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:28,178
you do a hunches<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some trivial</font>

435
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:30,158
home at the end of this whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing just</font>

436
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:32,320
to make me happy thank you out of this

437
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,899
last session of the last day it's true

438
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:39,700
Adam on<font color="#CCCCCC"> PC is I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just have a question</font>

439
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:42,070
about option one<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah so like ooh really</font>

440
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:45,969
is something that that CIS is interested

441
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:49,960
in but not necessarily exclusively for

442
00:25:45,969 --> 00:25:53,440
public broadcast of thing yes so the

443
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,809
option two is ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us in a lot of</font>

444
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,269
cases so because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have this closed</font>

445
00:25:55,809 --> 00:26:01,178
environment so Adam as a identify

446
00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:03,970
yourself Dave altameyer as a contributor

447
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:05,740
and I think the difference

448
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:08,710
really between option wanted option two

449
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:10,960
is focused around we have these

450
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:13,360
namespaces for which these additional

451
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,550
properties are going to you know fit

452
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,409
within do we do we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

453
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:20,470
controlled process for adding new

454
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:22,750
namespaces enrollee through an eye on a

455
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:25,930
registration so that we could we could

456
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:29,020
manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the namespace of namespaces</font>

457
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:33,250
essentially or or do we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow</font>

458
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:35,560
arbitrary<font color="#E5E5E5"> use of arbitrary namespaces by</font>

459
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:37,810
you know by implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> why by other</font>

460
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,840
drives uh it wouldn't it wouldn't

461
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:43,389
preclude it is the important<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing here</font>

462
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,649
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adam allows for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to put on</font>

463
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,990
any elements that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possibly</font>

464
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:49,240
want any of the time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not going</font>

465
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:50,320
to fail validation if you send<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to</font>

466
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,640
somebody who doesn't understand what

467
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,590
that is it just ignores the element

468
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,020
moves on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're it does it does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

469
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:58,240
preclude a use case I like option one

470
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,190
yeah I also like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea of being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

471
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,170
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something privately if you pick up</font>

472
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:03,640
and one or me to go out to I Anna and do

473
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:06,070
all the other stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could still do</font>

474
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:10,120
option<font color="#E5E5E5"> two yeah so this is Nancy came</font>

475
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:11,830
widget as an individual contributor so

476
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,770
I'm trying to understand the differences

477
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:19,149
of how I would define it from a general

478
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:22,210
term<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and so to me option one gives</font>

479
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:25,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">you the ability to dynamically create a</font>

480
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:29,740
new property and defines through that

481
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:32,800
schema the<font color="#E5E5E5"> semantic intent behind that</font>

482
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:36,550
property yes so beyond the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ini</font>

483
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:39,190
registration an option to my question to

484
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:43,770
you is it seems like as you register

485
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:48,070
these you know sorry I look<font color="#E5E5E5"> this way um</font>

486
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:50,950
so for option two when new properties

487
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:53,740
are exposed not only does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it go through</font>

488
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:56,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">the iono process but there has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be an</font>

489
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:59,380
understanding of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that namespace and</font>

490
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:01,540
schema would look like right option one

491
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,920
is the I Anna right well technically we

492
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">could probably work it so that we could</font>

493
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,640
do and I in a registry for either

494
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:09,130
another value of option two is that you

495
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,200
can do schema validation based on option

496
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:15,760
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give me option one did I just other</font>

497
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">one is gonna say I am not i would keep</font>

498
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,139
yes

499
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:21,668
okay and the schema validation thing

500
00:28:20,139 --> 00:28:25,748
that also came up as a lot of feedback

501
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:28,179
when we did I or<font color="#CCCCCC"> gif v2 right yeah so so</font>

502
00:28:25,749 --> 00:28:30,879
option one is the one with the iono

503
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:33,269
table registrations so that that is the

504
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:37,330
one that would let you do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Hank</font>

505
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:42,159
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> um this is Hank vocals from the</font>

506
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:44,080
front<font color="#E5E5E5"> / first of all Adam you can do</font>

507
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:48,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own stuff with option one quite</font>

508
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:50,529
well by just not publishing it so yeah

509
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:53,678
so that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first point I thing</font>

510
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:56,619
also a distributing schemas seems to be

511
00:28:53,679 --> 00:29:00,399
a thing for Rowley so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

512
00:28:56,619 --> 00:29:02,889
have consistent semantics with consumers

513
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:05,320
and providers of this information<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

514
00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:07,199
probably need at least of course the

515
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:11,379
registrations thingy but also a

516
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:14,349
distribution of schema which is also if

517
00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:17,559
you scare big sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem I</font>

518
00:29:14,349 --> 00:29:20,139
don't know how how you think this will

519
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:22,928
evolve in regard two versions and

520
00:29:20,139 --> 00:29:26,859
there's new name spaces but this can as

521
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:30,940
with every excess DXM ish thing be a big

522
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:34,059
hassle at some point so if you do not

523
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:36,759
really require versioning but are pretty

524
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:39,908
confident<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you are stable for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

525
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:43,169
sake of simplicity option two is

526
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:45,159
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> more like things I've done now</font>

527
00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:47,019
but if you're a lot my dilemma

528
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,059
traditionally one I have this rollout of

529
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:50,739
excess<font color="#E5E5E5"> these in this consistencies</font>

530
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:53,979
inversions and you want to do it very um

531
00:29:50,739 --> 00:29:57,389
yeah well traditionally in strongly

532
00:29:53,979 --> 00:30:02,080
defined I rather recommend option one

533
00:29:57,389 --> 00:30:05,498
depends on the overall strategy my

534
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,330
enrollee in combination have and the

535
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:09,399
option two is the way more flexible one

536
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:11,408
and you don't have to better all the

537
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:14,289
scheme our version<font color="#CCCCCC"> levels right well you</font>

538
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:17,259
can still do option to with option one

539
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:22,629
selected so it doesn't doesn't restrict

540
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:24,820
you if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would say in the draft to</font>

541
00:30:22,629 --> 00:30:26,529
option one and you can option two of

542
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:29,229
doing option two is basically messing it

543
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:30,680
up so then I would would say everyone's

544
00:30:29,229 --> 00:30:32,840
decide for one

545
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:35,510
but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> for both right right it would</font>

546
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:38,899
support the the private use use case

547
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:43,550
which is you know half of the rola use

548
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:45,740
case public-private from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rome engineer</font>

549
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:47,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">you assert my misunderstanding is there</font>

550
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:53,240
a third option which is option one and

551
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:55,190
two the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time sip okay okay I only</font>

552
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,870
ask because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like we went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

553
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:58,490
that discussion back when we were

554
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:00,590
talking at least about<font color="#CCCCCC"> IO definite we</font>

555
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,750
won both classes of them and that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

556
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:04,399
bit of discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm wondering why</font>

557
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,260
we wouldn't want to do that here so you

558
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,140
would support<font color="#E5E5E5"> this option three that's</font>

559
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:12,170
both of them cool I'm puttin it on the

560
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:17,000
table okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I can see the value for</font>

561
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:20,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">sensibility okay future so sorry this is</font>

562
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,520
adam for talking on jabber he says I

563
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:25,820
wonder whether we can use the combined

564
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:28,370
approach okay well he says I like the

565
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:32,860
way how I Oh dev version one allows to

566
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,860
use iono and private extensions<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

567
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:38,540
that sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like Dave altameyer that</font>

568
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:41,060
sounds like two plus ones for option 3

569
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:43,879
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support both optional on an</font>

570
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:45,830
option told so let's finish the<font color="#CCCCCC"> queue</font>

571
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:50,240
and then we'll will allow for the hung

572
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:54,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay hey hi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I am what he needs to</font>

573
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience them indeed indeed um yeah I</font>

574
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,280
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support that as well I'm</font>

575
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:02,120
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it more I'm after after</font>

576
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:10,030
this conversation hi yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so so</font>

577
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:14,659
let's do the hums and with full tons

578
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:16,280
option one is to do they and a registry

579
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:19,910
through the creation as you've listed

580
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:23,510
there option two is what you've listed

581
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:26,990
there an option three is to merge the

582
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:31,250
two to allow for both correct I think

583
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:33,560
that's what I heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is</font>

584
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:39,940
gonna be interesting could I get a hum

585
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:43,879
for option one go ahead oh that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

586
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay uh those for option one could you</font>

587
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:52,160
please

588
00:32:44,540 --> 00:33:00,050
oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay those for option two could you</font>

589
00:32:52,160 --> 00:33:04,810
please hum ok I hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> one come ok</font>

590
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:04,810
those for option three please hum I

591
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:14,630
think it's pretty clear so um<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ah</font>

592
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:18,830
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so Danny you've captured</font>

593
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:20,690
that in the notes okay so um will

594
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:25,310
reflect that in the minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

595
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:27,350
I'll take it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the meal ok so they can</font>

596
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:29,960
get direction<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right perfect thank</font>

597
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:31,550
you ok so that is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our issues all</font>

598
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,410
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues are on github by the way</font>

599
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:35,389
including<font color="#CCCCCC"> the review questions that were</font>

600
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,740
earlier so if you want to come comment

601
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:42,250
or look at them<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're all good up to</font>

602
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:44,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we go so issue number two so</font>

603
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:49,670
we have talked about this before um

604
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:52,250
briefly but we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get some final</font>

605
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:55,960
discussion in on it as we approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

606
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:58,820
deadline of this document general so

607
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:07,580
data model enumeration / registration

608
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:10,190
the concept<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is uh right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now the</font>

609
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:13,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">rolly format element describes the data</font>

610
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:17,120
model of the content the question is

611
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:19,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">should that be registered at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

612
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:24,889
when you write your extension document

613
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:27,410
that talks about the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> type so</font>

614
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:29,839
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some pros and cons of doing</font>

615
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:33,918
this data model registration or data

616
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:37,760
model enumeration it it does provide a

617
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:40,040
registered location for these it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

618
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,960
be like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a namespace for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IO def would</font>

619
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,699
define it that the content is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would f</font>

620
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,350
you put it in really format<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's defined</font>

621
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:46,939
in the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it does provide this</font>

622
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:49,060
kind of centralized location for all

623
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:54,560
these officially supported data formats

624
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:57,470
however it requires the extension

625
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,270
document writers to actually

626
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:05,500
just pick a name space for the data

627
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:08,180
models which might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not mean anything to</font>

628
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:10,550
anybody else right so even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

629
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:12,830
register a given name space for a data

630
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:14,810
model and you publicly distribute that

631
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:16,910
atom entry a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly entry out to the</font>

632
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:19,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">world and everybody gets this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rollie</font>

633
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:23,118
format element and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it says oh I'm a i'll</font>

634
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:26,890
def um that may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually mean</font>

635
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,890
anything to the client who receives that

636
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:34,220
so it it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a question of does</font>

637
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:37,520
it provide value to require<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

638
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:43,279
extension document authors to to

639
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:53,119
register those data formats um Dave

640
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:54,830
going up to the mic Dave<font color="#CCCCCC"> altameyer so</font>

641
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,790
this was driven<font color="#E5E5E5"> by some feedback that we</font>

642
00:35:54,830 --> 00:36:01,549
got at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last face to face at IETF 96</font>

643
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:04,310
and we started actually working on doing

644
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:09,380
this you know implementing some kind of

645
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:11,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">vienna registry for for registering the</font>

646
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:15,890
formats that are used you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> within</font>

647
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:18,290
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> within with enrollee and we quickly</font>

648
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:19,848
started to realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were creating</font>

649
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:22,670
a whole bunch of work for every

650
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:25,880
extension author that they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

651
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:29,810
do in order to you know to use a data

652
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:31,430
model within an extension and the more

653
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:33,290
work we started realizing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we were</font>

654
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:35,210
creating the more we actually got scared

655
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:37,730
about the fact that we were creating all

656
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:40,130
of this work because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to try to</font>

657
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:42,020
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as easy as possible to create a</font>

658
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:44,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">rolly extension because we want to see</font>

659
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:48,170
lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> rolling extensions you know be</font>

660
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:51,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">regenerated so this is really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just about</font>

661
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:54,200
an abundance of caution to not make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

662
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,910
too difficult for you know for creating

663
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,000
new extensions what this effectively

664
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:01,399
allows is for extensions to define what

665
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,320
data formats are allowed but doesn't

666
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,060
require those formats<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be registered</font>

667
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,080
in iono registry so you don't have to

668
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,960
write a whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ionic</font>

669
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:11,029
considerations in order to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

670
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,360
extension we feel like that's a good

671
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:17,330
between being explicit in what's allowed

672
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:20,870
but not being too formal and how it's

673
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:22,069
how it's being registered so we're kind

674
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:25,609
of looking for permission to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font>

675
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:27,800
forward with that set point or we'd like

676
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,330
to hear any any other considerations

677
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:39,710
that might take<font color="#E5E5E5"> us one direction or</font>

678
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:41,060
another so Roman Jews cert want to make

679
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:43,100
sure i understand it so what we're

680
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:46,279
talking about is documenting the

681
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,779
extension but not registering it so no

682
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">right a bit like it's just said no I</font>

683
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:52,570
Anna considerations that's right the

684
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:55,460
extension document can still discuss or

685
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:57,440
even talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different data</font>

686
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,060
models that might be reasonable to use

687
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,220
for that information type and talk about

688
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:03,890
how they might be used but to not

689
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:06,589
register them in an eye on a table so is

690
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:10,910
how is how is that different than option

691
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:14,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to but you chose to make a draft yeah I</font>

692
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:16,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean so sure as a chair I guess the</font>

693
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:19,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">question I'm gonna look at Kathleen</font>

694
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:23,360
since I'm a total noob when you say

695
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:26,330
document are you saying it would be an

696
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:29,030
ietf document like we'd handle through

697
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:33,350
the RFC process now so this is all<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

698
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:36,320
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the format extension so there's the</font>

699
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:39,500
format element contains a namespace

700
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,840
attribute that defines the namespace of

701
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:45,290
the referenced content by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly</font>

702
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:48,440
entry it can also contain pointers to a

703
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:52,430
schema location where for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the namespace</font>

704
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:54,950
a media type for the schema and a bunch

705
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:58,040
of other things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so but this is</font>

706
00:38:54,950 --> 00:39:00,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually about is is the namespace</font>

707
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:03,020
that's used in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Rolie format entry</font>

708
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:06,140
does that have to be registered I'm in

709
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:09,800
some specialized Diana table you know

710
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:13,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">for for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly format element that's</font>

711
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the question is yeah</font>

712
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:19,600
and that that namespace then would

713
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:21,339
represent the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the model of the content</font>

714
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:28,299
that's being referenced by the given

715
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:30,550
Adam pub entry in this case at Adam on

716
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:33,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">fill a CIS is anybody in this room read</font>

717
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:36,370
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sock'em draft that it's a Rollie</font>

718
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:39,400
extension draft for software identifiers

719
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:41,500
I think and the seas are you smile Tim

720
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,910
right so it's got a format in there

721
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,530
right so you could look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that draft</font>

722
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:46,299
and see an example of what we're talking

723
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:47,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">about if you have worked at that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah in</font>

724
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,880
the sea sir document we actually have

725
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:51,640
some slides about the sea sir document

726
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,220
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of this presentation uh right</font>

727
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:57,220
but but as you're pointing out Adam it's

728
00:39:54,220 --> 00:40:00,040
an ietf draft it's a document the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly</font>

729
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:01,890
extensions are IETF documents yes that

730
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:05,560
register information types because

731
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:08,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">information type is one of the category</font>

732
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:10,299
extension points those are registered in

733
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:13,060
iono table through<font color="#CCCCCC"> an RFC through an</font>

734
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:15,400
ietf document so the information types

735
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:17,080
which are really what almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> presumably</font>

736
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,620
all of the extension documents are going

737
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:22,840
to be the idea here is I can say this is

738
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:25,180
my information type here are some data

739
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,460
formats that are reasonable for my

740
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:30,580
information type that's kind of the

741
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:32,020
planned extension format which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

742
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:34,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly what the sea sword extension</font>

743
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:37,210
does it says we talk about incident and

744
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:38,890
indicator for example I oh def can do

745
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:40,690
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things sticks can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do these things</font>

746
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:43,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">X can do these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things we talked about</font>

747
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:46,150
the data formats so that's what's

748
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:48,840
happening now and in I<font color="#CCCCCC"> atf document yeah</font>

749
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:51,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">right sorry I had a delightful again if</font>

750
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:53,670
so I'm in the middle of writing I

751
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:56,020
haven't yet submitted a checklist

752
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:58,240
extension to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rolling super</font>

753
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,790
configuration checklist yeah and it'll

754
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,919
probably list in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> a format of X</font>

755
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:04,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">CCDF perhaps that's right but I don't</font>

756
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to i think i</font>

757
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:09,040
agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this wherever you are they go</font>

758
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:11,080
I don't necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have to go</font>

759
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,890
and register that format<font color="#CCCCCC"> ya know make</font>

760
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:16,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense right that's the intent so Dave</font>

761
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:21,549
altameyer would it be helpful if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we sent</font>

762
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:24,490
an example of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> options to the list</font>

763
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:26,980
to further clarify this or do we feel

764
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:34,839
like we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good enough understanding</font>

765
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:36,910
here to make a choice so the question on

766
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:43,990
the table is do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys understand</font>

767
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:46,210
what's being asked sorry I'm Chris nacio

768
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:47,979
sir I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> an example would be helpful</font>

769
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:50,830
but I actually do think I understand

770
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:56,140
what's being asked but it's not clear to

771
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:58,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">me what so the thing we're mired in the</font>

772
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:01,180
technicalities of what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing but I</font>

773
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:05,440
don't necessarily fully appreciate the

774
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:06,640
impacts so I get it you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

775
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,490
make an extension you don't have to do

776
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,230
an eye on our registry<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay or we could</font>

777
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:13,750
have private extensions that don't have

778
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:15,369
I Anna registries it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me</font>

779
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:17,590
that even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you say in the Raleigh</font>

780
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:19,180
draft you have to have an I Anna you

781
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:20,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">know you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people actually</font>

782
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:25,419
have to do that they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> always not</font>

783
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:27,160
bother so I mean you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can state must all</font>

784
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:31,180
you want but implementation don't really

785
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:33,609
have to comply with that so it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

786
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:36,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">me the more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> realistic question is is</font>

787
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:38,470
there some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of way to to slice</font>

788
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:44,880
namespaces to say that these are

789
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:44,879
registered and registered versus not

790
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:55,869
Dave Walter<font color="#E5E5E5"> wire and well namespaces ru</font>

791
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:57,550
RI so you are is can be you know can

792
00:42:55,869 --> 00:43:00,550
handle that name spacing you know within

793
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:05,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier right and so so you know</font>

794
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:07,750
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would state is there this seems like a</font>

795
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:11,259
fruitless argument unless you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

796
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:13,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">to say something like we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

797
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:15,430
know make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we have namespace</font>

798
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,859
that says it's you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> an a raleigh</font>

799
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:20,049
or something like that I think that's

800
00:43:17,859 --> 00:43:22,420
why the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> argument really is tyanna</font>

801
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:28,270
register or not tie in a register yeah

802
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:30,150
really yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so and I can catch you</font>

803
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:34,630
off<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that make your comment and</font>

804
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:36,400
because you do register I just heard

805
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:40,450
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> context here the information</font>

806
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:43,329
type yes each extension

807
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:45,118
every new like draft will go through the

808
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,990
eye on a registration process by

809
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:50,260
registering the information types you

810
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:52,240
just want to avoid have specific data

811
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:55,030
formats tight through that registration

812
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,399
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it is misleading to say we</font>

813
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:58,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">are voting on not registering or</font>

814
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,280
reducing something because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

815
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:02,230
already registered something you don't

816
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,180
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into more detail for the</font>

817
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:05,500
format which I understand yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

818
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,930
reducing the registration leather

819
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,369
clarify the question yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

820
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:10,720
question is way more easier fonts I

821
00:44:09,369 --> 00:44:17,589
think that the question of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state of</font>

822
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:21,098
it I Anna like just can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you actually do</font>

823
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:24,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">that can you can you register something</font>

824
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:27,820
in the eye on a registry that you know

825
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:31,329
presumably using a document are we doing

826
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:33,880
expert review I don't know which can you

827
00:44:31,329 --> 00:44:38,680
register it and then reference something

828
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:46,329
to which there's no reference<font color="#CCCCCC"> Zack so so</font>

829
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:51,220
which it so it would yes and then you

830
00:44:46,329 --> 00:44:53,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys listen to me you're done ok so the</font>

831
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:55,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">register would be specification required</font>

832
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:57,670
so the document making the registry

833
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:01,000
would be the reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so my</font>

834
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:03,880
suggestion is a clarification should get

835
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:07,420
made an example should be provided if

836
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:09,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">you could provide it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the mail list so</font>

837
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,319
that we can move this along right

838
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,299
because we'd like to hit the December

839
00:45:11,319 --> 00:45:16,240
deadline so if you can provide an

840
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:18,069
example of what that means and try to

841
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,078
provide your perspective of the

842
00:45:18,069 --> 00:45:24,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">implications</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that will help</font>

843
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:26,079
address Chris's points right he kinda

844
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,910
understands<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but doesn't quite see the</font>

845
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,200
full impact I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that would help yeah</font>

846
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:32,890
we can we can put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together something</font>

847
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:37,118
that expresses that yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so just FYI</font>

848
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:38,710
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> only in slide 7 of 16 yes so we</font>

849
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,050
got to move this along here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

850
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:43,750
will do because of this time issue we

851
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:46,510
have a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues uh bring those</font>

852
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:48,400
two lists<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is the best way to</font>

853
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:51,099
handle the remaining issues and I'm

854
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,599
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and give the brief talk</font>

855
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:54,309
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that like just a couple minutes</font>

856
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:56,170
about the sea<font color="#E5E5E5"> sword extension documen</font>

857
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:57,880
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just recently published it may</font>

858
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:00,099
be good I mean I didn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that cuz</font>

859
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:03,099
we've got time<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there's two more</font>

860
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:06,279
presentations over you okay so how about

861
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:09,670
I give you like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten more minutes okay</font>

862
00:46:06,279 --> 00:46:11,049
yeah we can do that we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say okay so</font>

863
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:13,569
the rest last couple issues are a little

864
00:46:11,049 --> 00:46:16,180
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier actually rollies current</font>

865
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:18,130
status is informational there are many

866
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:20,379
many informative I mean normative

867
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:22,449
references enrollee so we would like to

868
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:24,910
switch it to a standards track document

869
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:26,709
so our proposal is we switch it to a

870
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:32,140
standards track document is there any

871
00:46:26,709 --> 00:46:36,910
strong opinion opposing that you get to

872
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:38,529
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> another hung</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we could ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

873
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:40,420
question and then again we'll take it

874
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:45,249
back to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mail group right so the</font>

875
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:48,069
question on the table is everybody

876
00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:51,640
informational it was informational um

877
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:54,058
when we picked it up just do you agree

878
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:57,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the rolly draft should be made</font>

879
00:46:54,059 --> 00:47:03,039
standards track as opposed to

880
00:46:57,009 --> 00:47:09,759
informational can we do we can do that

881
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:18,179
you're the 80<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay oh then we can do</font>

882
00:47:09,759 --> 00:47:18,179
experimental<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let's start with</font>

883
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:27,848
okay so experimental<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus information</font>

884
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:30,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just decisions how many</font>

885
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:33,670
implementations are there well we're

886
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:42,880
writing one and and some 100 there's

887
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:44,170
three so okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm gonna do yes I</font>

888
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,910
already got one home so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

889
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:48,670
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> any more hums that's okay that's all</font>

890
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:51,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">right okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't let me run the</font>

891
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:53,589
meeting please so those who believe

892
00:47:51,789 --> 00:47:58,119
there should be an experimental draft

893
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:59,558
please hum well there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go those who</font>

894
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:03,809
believe there should be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> standards</font>

895
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:03,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">track draft please hum</font>

896
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:10,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so I think we haven't so well yeah</font>

897
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:20,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay done with that one cool um so is</font>

898
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,399
this the these two<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues are very</font>

899
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:23,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">closely related so I'll just go over</font>

900
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,270
them both at what we have to do it

901
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:27,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">separately so service documents are</font>

902
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:30,140
really really important to the operation

903
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:32,780
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rolly you use the surface document to</font>

904
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:34,850
discover what feeds you have available

905
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:37,610
and the you are the resource at

906
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:39,380
locations of all of those feeds so if

907
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:42,680
you can't find the service document you

908
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:45,050
can't find the feeds and you're out of

909
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,850
luck so right now the standardized

910
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:49,250
location of the service document is a

911
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:50,660
should requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> enrollee we would</font>

912
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:53,300
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change that to a must</font>

913
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:55,160
requirement so that that standardized

914
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,900
location allows any kind of client to

915
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:00,649
actually discover what's on the server

916
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:03,560
reliably without this it is going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

917
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:06,290
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard for a client to discover what</font>

918
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:09,710
feeds are available oh I'll economical

919
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:13,880
why don't you use dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-known dot 10</font>

920
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:17,600
well known oh well known because there

921
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:21,200
is another<font color="#CCCCCC"> H HTTP RFC saying that hard</font>

922
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:22,790
coded URLs are bad thing unless they

923
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,160
thought well known basically well it's

924
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:27,320
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a it's not it's only partly</font>

925
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:37,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard-coded I mean it's based off the</font>

926
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:40,730
server route well it still<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I think</font>

927
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:42,550
a well known location you're still going

928
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:44,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">to run into some of the same problems</font>

929
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:46,100
right it has to be advertised somewhere

930
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,720
like I have to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that off</font>

931
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,009
some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> known location at some</font>

932
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:53,720
point or else you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to find</font>

933
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:56,210
the service document no no duties<font color="#E5E5E5"> a on</font>

934
00:49:53,720 --> 00:50:01,609
web service there is dot well well dash

935
00:49:56,210 --> 00:50:03,980
known as is reserved prefix and under it

936
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:05,900
you can have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of</font>

937
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:10,660
documents and for that there is I on the

938
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:10,660
registry so you go there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

939
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:18,060
I understand what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying suggest</font>

940
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:22,530
to the Dave altameyer just to clarify

941
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:25,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">Alexei the this is a template so the URL</font>

942
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:27,090
template because the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that every</font>

943
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:31,259
organization that stands up their own

944
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:36,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">rowley repository would implement this</font>

945
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:41,010
template providing a well known location

946
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:43,230
for that server to discover<font color="#CCCCCC"> the resource</font>

947
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:46,830
collections that are published by the

948
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:49,710
server so our intent is not to provide a

949
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:51,690
single global well known location but to

950
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:56,880
allow each server to have a well known

951
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:59,160
location yeah so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way a client would</font>

952
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:02,430
only have to know that location and the

953
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:06,629
name<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the the service name and it</font>

954
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:09,690
could basically go find it how does the

955
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:13,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">klein find out the location has to know</font>

956
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:19,860
the host which is a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of scope</font>

957
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:21,540
for this document no host discovery but

958
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:24,000
as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a host you can find</font>

959
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:25,350
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly server there so but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hoes</font>

960
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,720
discovery is out of scope for this

961
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:29,940
document if you want if there's room for

962
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,899
a kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hosts discovery type thing</font>

963
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:34,620
then that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in a separate</font>

964
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:36,540
document i think but once you have a

965
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:38,279
host or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list of hosts you can check</font>

966
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:48,690
them all<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Olli servers if this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

967
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:50,190
must requirement I don't want to be a

968
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:52,080
bottle night but I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

969
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:53,730
a discussion on this that's all know

970
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:58,020
that's why I want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get involved</font>

971
00:51:53,730 --> 00:52:00,360
people from HTTP that my object later on

972
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:02,520
if you do the wrong thing yes yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font>

973
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:07,320
see i was gonna ask for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an expert review</font>

974
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:08,910
at the end ok this is this is part of

975
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,400
them don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that'll help right</font>

976
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:14,370
but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm hearing is we need</font>

977
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:16,860
further discussion and so in the

978
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:19,380
interest of time what I would suggest is

979
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:22,440
that we continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this one the</font>

980
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:24,420
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on on the mail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok yeah I</font>

981
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">appreciate the feedback we're looking</font>

982
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:27,859
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who</font>

983
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:29,240
are aware of these type of things so I'm

984
00:52:27,859 --> 00:52:30,950
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad you brought that up and</font>

985
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,569
we'll talk about it on list and get as

986
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:35,750
much feedback as we can on it to do it

987
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:37,549
right and with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind the</font>

988
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:40,099
categories document is the exact same

989
00:52:37,549 --> 00:52:42,349
thing it's another top level document

990
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:44,140
that just lists the categories and so

991
00:52:42,349 --> 00:52:46,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the exact same question is the</font>

992
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:47,980
service discovery document and so will

993
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:50,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">we will discuss this at the same time</font>

994
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:51,710
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the this is the exact</font>

995
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,740
same issue more<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> less just with a</font>

996
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:58,369
different document um so no<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason to</font>

997
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:59,390
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this now um and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we're not</font>

998
00:52:58,369 --> 00:53:00,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about this so this doesn't</font>

999
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:02,540
matter but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

1000
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,920
kind of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> a categories document looks</font>

1001
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:06,558
like it just lists all the categories

1002
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,430
that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly server provides so we're</font>

1003
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to talk about this right now</font>

1004
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:10,040
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to go to list</font>

1005
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:13,190
along with the service document stuff

1006
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:15,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay those are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the issues that are open</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm going to go over very quickly cuz</font>

1041
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:38,780
I'm like double over my time so Rowley

1042
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:39,529
see Sir is the draft that adds the

1043
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:42,650
indicator

1044
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:46,100
and the incident<font color="#E5E5E5"> information types to</font>

1045
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:49,220
Rowley this is text and requirements

1046
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:52,160
that used to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the original I think</font>

1047
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:54,379
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the 0 2 or 0 1 version of Rowley</font>

1048
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:57,290
back when it was designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> io def</font>

1049
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:59,750
carrier and since I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rowley can now carry</font>

1050
00:54:57,290 --> 00:55:01,580
many different things the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IO def and</font>

1051
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:06,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">seizure specific text was pulled out and</font>

1052
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:09,049
is now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> role ec cert extension so it</font>

1053
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:10,880
registers and describes the indicator

1054
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:12,410
and incident information types and

1055
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,980
includes all the normative requirements

1056
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:19,160
that went along with using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the iof</font>

1057
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:20,810
format this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just recently uploaded</font>

1058
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:24,470
as a personal draft in the last couple

1059
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:27,080
of weeks see if I have in<font color="#CCCCCC"> here oh these</font>

1060
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:30,080
are issues for Caesar so we would really

1061
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:32,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">love to see this document adopted into</font>

1062
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:34,400
mile so we can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at it and get</font>

1063
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:36,710
it back get get<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that text that was</font>

1064
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,840
taken out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rowley back next to it here</font>

1065
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:43,940
and mile so that that is the what we

1066
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:47,600
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see happen to see cert we</font>

1067
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:49,910
added to<font color="#E5E5E5"> IO def attributes that were</font>

1068
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:52,850
very important in IO<font color="#E5E5E5"> def as categories</font>

1069
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:54,290
in the whole category extension point so

1070
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:57,140
purpose and restriction have been

1071
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:59,990
exposed as categories in rowley entries

1072
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:02,960
so that you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example find all</font>

1073
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:04,250
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IO def entries by their purpose</font>

1074
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,240
or by the restriction and it makes it

1075
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:07,190
easier to find those things without

1076
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:10,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">having to download the IDF document if</font>

1077
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:13,010
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are other I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> o def attributes that</font>

1078
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:15,170
make sense as categories please let us

1079
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:16,970
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> please come to list or whatever</font>

1080
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:18,620
else with these so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can add them</font>

1081
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:23,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">as categories in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly category</font>

1082
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:26,180
extension system and as we talked about

1083
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:28,430
earlier in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rowley property which</font>

1084
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:33,230
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have support for option</font>

1085
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:36,830
three we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add the iof ID in</font>

1086
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:39,590
the iof date as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first of those rolly</font>

1087
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:41,720
property exposures so that you can find

1088
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:42,890
the iof documents by those attributes

1089
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have to download the whole thing</font>

1090
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:46,250
again if there are other properties that

1091
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:48,410
you think are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important</font>

1092
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:50,060
crucially important for finding iof

1093
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:52,399
documents that need to be exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1094
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:54,850
properties please let us know<font color="#E5E5E5"> on list or</font>

1095
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,850
otherwise

1096
00:56:55,179 --> 00:57:00,349
we need development help and review for

1097
00:56:58,459 --> 00:57:02,118
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sea sir document as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well as the</font>

1098
00:57:00,349 --> 00:57:03,489
sockem document for software descriptors

1099
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:06,079
if that is something that interests you

1100
00:57:03,489 --> 00:57:07,849
this is a brand new document it's a 0-0

1101
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,569
draft that was just uploaded a couple

1102
00:57:07,849 --> 00:57:13,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">weeks ago so we'd love to get as much</font>

1103
00:57:10,569 --> 00:57:15,469
review<font color="#CCCCCC"> and support working on that as we</font>

1104
00:57:13,909 --> 00:57:17,979
can and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> come open issues on</font>

1105
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:22,279
github come help on issues on github um

1106
00:57:17,979 --> 00:57:23,959
anything Dave so about 80 de volta<font color="#CCCCCC"> meyer</font>

1107
00:57:22,279 --> 00:57:26,479
so about eighty percent of the text on

1108
00:57:23,959 --> 00:57:28,549
this draft is previously<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopted text by</font>

1109
00:57:26,479 --> 00:57:32,718
the working group so we would certainly

1110
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:40,249
like to see this be adopted by the

1111
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:42,499
working group as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> t so um that is</font>

1112
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:44,808
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly see Sir document we'd love to</font>

1113
00:57:42,499 --> 00:57:47,178
see it adopted as soon as possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1114
00:57:44,809 --> 00:57:51,439
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would suggest you do is um</font>

1115
00:57:47,179 --> 00:57:55,880
announced that and solicit feedback in

1116
00:57:51,439 --> 00:57:59,629
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mail okay and we can discuss it from</font>

1117
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:02,029
a time perspective um we could call<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1118
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:06,499
consensus for adoption at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next at</font>

1119
00:58:02,029 --> 00:58:10,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Chicago meeting okay so yeah okay</font>

1120
00:58:06,499 --> 00:58:12,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so uh coming back to the base</font>

1121
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:14,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">rowley draft yes that needs to move</font>

1122
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:18,589
forward before we can do the extensions

1123
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:21,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think um so for that you've got the</font>

1124
00:58:18,589 --> 00:58:23,029
whole list of issues Trey we felt

1125
00:58:21,229 --> 00:58:25,908
several of them so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's good well</font>

1126
00:58:23,029 --> 00:58:29,059
right but you still have a set so what I

1127
00:58:25,909 --> 00:58:31,519
had suggested and to Alexei right was to

1128
00:58:29,059 --> 00:58:34,669
do an expert review but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1129
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:36,828
should come after we have resolutions

1130
00:58:34,669 --> 00:58:39,199
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current issues that we didn't</font>

1131
00:58:36,829 --> 00:58:42,559
have time to the pole here okay right

1132
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:46,069
plus the ones um so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me know and</font>

1133
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:49,579
through the mail as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as and we'll</font>

1134
00:58:46,069 --> 00:58:51,739
monitor<font color="#E5E5E5"> um but you need to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

1135
00:58:49,579 --> 00:58:53,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">that just because not everybody like me</font>

1136
00:58:51,739 --> 00:58:55,729
goes through github and looks at the

1137
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:58,549
issues just put them back out on the

1138
00:58:55,729 --> 00:59:00,589
mail group okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll get the</font>

1139
00:58:58,549 --> 00:59:01,788
discussion going<font color="#E5E5E5"> there okay yeah well</font>

1140
00:59:00,589 --> 00:59:03,349
we'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the mailing list with a</font>

1141
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:05,689
bunch of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues and try and get</font>

1142
00:59:03,349 --> 00:59:07,800
this sorted up as fast as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible as we</font>

1143
00:59:05,689 --> 00:59:11,339
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> this out so if there's not any</font>

1144
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:15,030
last questions comments concerns I will

1145
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:17,190
end my very long presentation that was a

1146
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:20,340
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> long 30 minutes it was a very long</font>

1147
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:22,590
30 minutes no but it was good thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1148
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:26,790
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you for making progress on it ro</font>

1149
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:30,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks so you get to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

1150
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:41,250
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you hit the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> button so next we</font>

1151
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:44,340
have Nancy with XMPP grid<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right good</font>

1152
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:47,430
morning Nancy Kim widget um I think I

1153
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:49,620
only have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one slide so I had three or</font>

1154
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:53,190
four different commenters provide

1155
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:56,029
feedback on the XMPP grid so many thanks

1156
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:58,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">for that on a lot of it was</font>

1157
00:59:56,030 --> 01:00:01,680
clarifications there was a long

1158
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:04,319
discussion on the discovery mechanism

1159
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:06,930
and we debated because I hits assumed

1160
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:11,490
that the base XMPP grid does talk about

1161
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:13,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">the pods up but we decided and agreed I</font>

1162
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:15,240
think through the mail reflector that it

1163
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:17,760
would be more explicit if we just

1164
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:21,169
referenced that actual extension of the

1165
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:24,180
pub sub in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft so um oh thanks so</font>

1166
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:26,840
basically there were on some

1167
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:31,140
clarifications some typos that we met a

1168
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:35,220
fixed and the editorial category<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

1169
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:36,839
mentioned the pub sub so Jeff 60 is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1170
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:40,319
extension that describes how the

1171
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:43,080
publish-subscribe works we had only

1172
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:45,690
cited the XML example for how you do the

1173
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:51,740
subscription we've added how you do both

1174
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:55,800
subscription as well as publication and

1175
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:58,399
then added a few more sentences and I

1176
01:00:55,800 --> 01:01:02,300
can't remember that in to the sections

1177
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:06,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">where in the overview I think we said</font>

1178
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:11,010
for the extensibility of other potential

1179
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:13,260
pups of mechanisms because XMPP also may

1180
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:16,350
allow for others just like Jeff 60 is

1181
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:20,130
one extension for pub sub we needed to

1182
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:24,210
allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that on so we added text</font>

1183
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:26,490
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address that set of comments um so</font>

1184
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:30,120
that was basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> updates that was</font>

1185
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:33,569
done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> two version one um thank you</font>

1186
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:37,589
Chris<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> providing feedback on this</font>

1187
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:39,390
version um so I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to better</font>

1188
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:41,070
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we don't have to do it</font>

1189
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:44,190
here unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do it with the</font>

1190
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:49,940
open mic of what we need to do to make

1191
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:59,070
things more clear right so with that any

1192
01:01:49,940 --> 01:02:00,930
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> so next slide please so um the</font>

1193
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:04,380
question as the author one of the

1194
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:08,609
authors is do we feel we're ready for

1195
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:14,580
this should we do another set of last

1196
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:19,320
call comments before Takeshi takes it

1197
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:21,330
for publication but that's a question it

1198
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:26,060
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be useful to to get a show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1199
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:26,060
hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to see who has read the draft</font>

1200
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:36,600
so too so probably would be useful to to

1201
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:38,670
get more review can I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get some</font>

1202
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:42,890
show of hands for people who would be

1203
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:42,890
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in reviewing the draft</font>

1204
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:52,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">Steven thanks Adam</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Thank You Hank okay</font>

1205
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:54,450
so we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have we're trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1206
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">move fairly quickly on this so if you</font>

1207
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:58,710
could get your drafts and your reviews

1208
01:02:56,580 --> 01:03:05,370
and within the next few weeks that would

1209
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:07,770
be that would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> appreciated adam said a</font>

1210
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:10,950
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> days so i can write that down well</font>

1211
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:13,020
the milestone state said for<font color="#CCCCCC"> December no</font>

1212
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:15,120
no the milestone date said december i

1213
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:18,900
think right so that'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> give us some time</font>

1214
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:22,200
to address any comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike Jones</font>

1215
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:25,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">Microsoft a clarification question is</font>

1216
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:28,490

much for providing this remote

1236
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:52,730
participation so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about Jason</font>

1237
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:56,700
binding of our death so this displays so

1238
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:59,670
next please three so let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me talk about</font>

1239
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:02,009
the summary of discussion at dinner with

1240
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:04,980
the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting I think people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1241
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:09,690
generally in favor of defining the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jason</font>

1242
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:12,390
binding so in the discussion we have

1243
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:15,119
several question dinner'll be the

1244
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:18,299
difference between Jason I Otis an iOS

1245
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:20,760
version 3 was unclear that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a message</font>

1246
01:05:18,299 --> 01:05:22,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">I received from the camp for the people</font>

1247
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:26,099
for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have received two</font>

1248
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:28,740
question is it going to be a subset or

1249
01:05:26,099 --> 01:05:31,470
extension I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I can answer</font>

1250
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:34,259
the question last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I also got the</font>

1251
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:36,180
question like this keep in mind that XML

1252
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:39,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">or JSON contain the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> level of</font>

1253
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:42,210
expressiveness so currently i'm trying

1254
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:43,230
to clarify the difference between Jason

1255
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:46,590
resume

1256
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:50,369
xml version apostles that we had a lot

1257
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:53,340
of discussion in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Japan item JP and we</font>

1258
01:05:50,369 --> 01:05:56,670
have got several feedback first one is

1259
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:59,940
jason is also used by program it does

1260
01:05:56,670 --> 01:06:03,200
not need all field of I you back when we

1261
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:06,270
want to use all<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeds we just use XML</font>

1262
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:08,730
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second so that I got is the concept</font>

1263
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:12,060
of ionic version 2 is much more

1264
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:17,700
flexibility but this in Brazil can be

1265
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:21,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">different the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> third comet I got is I got</font>

1266
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:25,609
it present to can carry various data but

1267
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:29,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is not easy to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write this data in XML</font>

1268
01:06:25,609 --> 01:06:39,240
so based on this feed but I was writing

1269
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:41,910
new version this space please so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1270
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:47,129
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> summary of the difference between</font>

1271
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:49,859
Jason resume and I only<font color="#CCCCCC"> present so first</font>

1272
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:54,990
of all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and prodigy is compatible</font>

1273
01:06:49,859 --> 01:06:59,250
with ionic present too so what I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

1274
01:06:54,990 --> 01:07:01,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">compatible is it can be converted into I</font>

1275
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:06,420
got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> project to automatically without</font>

1276
01:07:01,859 --> 01:07:09,560
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and also there is dog</font>

1277
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:13,050
mandatory field for Jason I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh death</font>

1278
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:16,049
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because Jason does not have</font>

1279
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:21,420
attribute or element it was easier for

1280
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:26,310
me to have a design<font color="#CCCCCC"> back please so this</font>

1281
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:28,500
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> three field 40 in there and the</font>

1282
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:30,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jason I Otis cannot express the type of</font>

1283
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:33,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">data that could not be expressed in</font>

1284
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:38,760
ionic present do in this way I'm

1285
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:41,490

need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make station some difference can</font>

1287

be necessary when writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a drastic</font>

1288
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:53,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">reports for changes first one is some</font>

1289
01:07:49,859 --> 01:07:54,630
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> what changed we were to write</font>

1290
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:58,439
in JSON

1291
01:07:54,630 --> 01:08:02,160
later it was not so easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know is</font>

1292
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:05,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">evident or array so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we use array I</font>

1293
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:09,750
will do have a date with the enemy so

1294
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:13,740
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can see this is array second one</font>

1295
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:17,158
is I notice is semantically<font color="#E5E5E5"> great I like</font>

1296
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:20,219
it but whenever right Jason I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1297
01:08:17,158 --> 01:08:22,649
make it work hope that so some classes

1298
01:08:20,219 --> 01:08:28,198
that exists only for semantics of

1299
01:08:22,649 --> 01:08:31,250
consistency is omitted third one is some

1300
01:08:28,198 --> 01:08:34,198
simplified expression is committed

1301
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:39,029
unfortunately i<font color="#E5E5E5"> will just be introduced</font>

1302
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:40,678
profile for the Assad regime because the

1303
01:08:39,029 --> 01:08:43,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">SF browser does not have bought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dress</font>

1304
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:46,500
code because we do not have any monetary

1305
01:08:43,529 --> 01:08:48,330
fail by using profile we want to have

1306
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:57,210
some modification for the uses of the

1307
01:08:48,330 --> 01:09:00,689
elements so the extra please so<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone</font>

1308
01:08:57,210 --> 01:09:04,139
with Namor chicks so hope what stick to

1309
01:09:00,689 --> 01:09:07,198
portraits in some places the data what

1310
01:09:04,139 --> 01:09:11,790
seems to event date on this when the

1311
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:14,158
data is supposed to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in array when I</font>

1312
01:09:11,790 --> 01:09:17,100
right at Jason I did not want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

1313
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:19,888
the JSON schema so it should be more

1314
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:22,819
clear with us the data is the array for

1315
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:25,319
Harper you rotate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the leg flexes the</font>

1316
01:09:22,819 --> 01:09:29,449
writer of the document can easily

1317
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:29,449
understood whether this is array or dot

1318
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:38,339
this so please so some classes that

1319
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:42,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">exist the only photo article purpose is</font>

1320
01:09:38,339 --> 01:09:44,790
omitted for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow to us this is</font>

1321
01:09:42,389 --> 01:09:48,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">very understandable I left this design</font>

1322
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:53,310
but when I'm right Jason Griffey<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we</font>

1323
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:55,559

Scalia as well indicate a class as well

1328
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:11,440
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meet the prince kind of</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> semantics of classes this will</font>

1330
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:20,919
please also<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I write that port</font>

1331
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:24,190
number of IP address simplified

1332
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:26,830
expression should be supported so for

1333
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:31,839
Jason buy ink drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

1334
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:38,830
this kind of simplified expression this

1335
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:43,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">so please profile this this is something</font>

1336
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:45,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">I should design more in detail but we</font>

1337
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:49,570
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a profile in order to limit</font>

1338
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:53,050
the use of ionic element<font color="#CCCCCC"> are your</font>

1339
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:56,320
disposal<font color="#CCCCCC"> to can say this field is</font>

1340
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:59,190
mandatory or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not but Jason browser does</font>

1341
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:05,200
not say this gradual is monetary or not

1342
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:10,389
so by allowing profile we could limit

1343
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:13,269
the use of the element want profile we

1344
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:17,250
are building it's a double profile we

1345
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:20,170
are using a tablet decent monitoring so

1346
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:22,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">for this purpose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we were tentatively</font>

1347
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:27,550
building a great profile in order to

1348
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:33,640
demonstrate how we can use profile so

1349
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:36,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">this page please so this is the example</font>

1350
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:41,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think I have shown this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> place before</font>

1351
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:44,980
in the previous meeting this is a Jason

1352
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:48,700
so when I would like to write our alert

1353
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:51,639
by using the Jason that is directly

1354
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:54,340
converted from iOS version to this would

1355
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:58,060
be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as you can see we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have our</font>

1356
01:11:54,340 --> 01:12:02,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">empty glass suggests both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1357
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:05,110
see we have IP address and also code

1358
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:10,650
number in a different places is it a bit

1359
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:12,759
troublesome for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> though if we use our</font>

1360
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:17,030
JSON

1361
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:20,180
binding draft the data structure can be

1362
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:25,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">totally different so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can take it</font>

1363
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:31,400
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> place I could you go to the</font>

1364
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:36,820
next page please one more please this

1365
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:40,839
equally follow the proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

1366
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:44,870
adjacent binding draft the data can be

1367
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:47,560
changed like this it's so simple I just

1368
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:50,200
converted the structure following the

1369
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:54,440
rules presented in this presentation

1370
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:59,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">then everton look so smart for me so I</font>

1371
01:12:54,440 --> 01:13:01,280
hope we want to build the TSM binding

1372
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:05,420
draft that can simplify the expression

1373
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:11,389
or the data so could you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go home please</font>

1374
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:14,660
explain please so final question is that

1375
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:19,280
I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to upload new version to data</font>

1376
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:21,590
tracker but I was not able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just with</font>

1377
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:25,070
agent applauding as we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working to</font>

1378
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:29,020
fill<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft or a division trapped we had</font>

1379
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:32,210
a call about the main list and no

1380
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:34,970
decision was made but<font color="#E5E5E5"> still we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have had</font>

1381
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:38,720
several support and obviously what's

1382
01:13:34,970 --> 01:13:42,370
right so if it's okay I got to upload

1383
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:47,810
new version as a working group draft

1384
01:13:42,370 --> 01:13:52,340
thank you so Takeshi there's a already

1385
01:13:47,810 --> 01:13:56,870
aversion uploaded an older one only all

1386
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:59,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the wrong is uploaded okay um so I'd</font>

1387
01:13:56,870 --> 01:14:04,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">like to get a sense from the room who's</font>

1388
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:09,050
actually read the older draft nobody

1389
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:16,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so Takeshi I didn't get a show of</font>

1390
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:21,640
hands<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the room for the old draft so</font>

1391
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:21,640
my suggestion would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be go ahead uh</font>

1392
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:27,139
I think in two or<font color="#CCCCCC"> three months ago we</font>

1393
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:29,390
had a kind of discussion on the mailing

1394
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:34,510
list with her it could be a working

1395
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:38,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">group draft or not then the result was</font>

1396
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:40,400
something we had several persons who

1397
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:44,960
were supportive but nobody's what's

1398
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:47,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so I wanted to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what time I</font>

1399
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:54,010
actually wasn't expected by the working

1400
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:54,010
group so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do yeah so my suggestion yeah</font>

1401
01:14:54,910 --> 01:15:02,059
my suggestion is go ahead and upload the

1402
01:14:58,610 --> 01:15:07,009
new version put it out on the mail list

1403
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:11,720
and um let me know and then as the chair

1404
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:14,630
I can ask for review once we get some

1405
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:17,270
comments then we can post a question in

1406
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:19,370
the mail group whether we can get

1407
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:25,280
consensus to adopt it as a working group

1408
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:28,090
draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let me just clarify my</font>

1409
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:31,670
understanding i will just upload<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as</font>

1410
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:35,210
individual draft again and try to guess

1411
01:15:31,670 --> 01:15:36,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then you will be asking to group</font>

1412
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:40,640
whether this could be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> working dog</font>

1413
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:48,050
again later is it correct correct thank
