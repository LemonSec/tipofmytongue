1
00:00:04,670 --> 00:01:53,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well as the possibility it's fine</font>

2
00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:53,560
art there's a 2wd next yeah okay

3
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:32,300
oh I now shown this before right next to

4
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:35,630
previous and yeah hold on and I may have

5
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:45,520
to it normally<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said does</font>

6
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:45,519
know is it sure what's going on that

7
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:54,410
should I push the escape button since

8
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:59,240
while we still have yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can just do I</font>

9
00:02:54,410 --> 00:03:01,609
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just yes I don't go back to thank</font>

10
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:05,090
you everyone sorry for late start so

11
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:08,360
welcome today to the ed ed you tutorial

12
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dearness privacy my name is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sarah</font>

13
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dickinson very glad to see so many faces</font>

14
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:15,590
here today so I'll move forward on to

15
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:19,070
the overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what we'll talk about</font>

16
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,830
today so the tutorial is basically split

17
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:25,040
up into three sections the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> section</font>

18
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:27,080
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a background of why are</font>

19
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,470
we talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> dearness privacy as an</font>

20
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:33,440
issue and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> did this rise and to kick</font>

21
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,300
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> off and Daniel can't Gilmore has</font>

22
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,490
kindly agreed to give a few slides to

23
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:42,410
set this in the context of the bigger

24
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:45,650
picture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet privacy after that</font>

25
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,090
we'll move on to talk about the huge

26
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,070
amount of work<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been done over the</font>

27
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:51,080
last three or four years<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this area a</font>

28
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,549
lot of it through the ITF a lot of it

29
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,470
through the deprived working group and

30
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:57,530
then finally I'll talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current</font>

31
00:03:54,470 --> 00:04:01,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">status</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of implementations deployment and</font>

32
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,750
tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are available today so thank</font>

33
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,079
you so without further ado I'll hand

34
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,080
over

35
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,859
so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk just a little bit to</font>

36
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:25,470
set the frame for why DNS privacy

37
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:26,880
matters more generally it matters sure

38
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:31,670
there's a bigger picture why does

39
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:34,200
privacy on the Internet itself matter so

40
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,550
just to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to motivate it so that we're</font>

41
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff sort of on the</font>

42
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:51,600
same page<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can looks like it doesn't</font>

43
00:04:39,900 --> 00:05:00,750
look at it full screen thing is it at

44
00:04:51,600 --> 00:05:02,720
1pm yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so so the concern</font>

45
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,100
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that there's sort of an issue of</font>

46
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,620
possibility of sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a centralized</font>

47
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,540
surveillance state acting as a form of

48
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,910
social control now you might you might

49
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,190
be concerned about governmental control

50
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:17,220
you might be concerned about criminal

51
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:19,200
control blackmail a range of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

52
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,430
things but basically whoever controls

53
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,349
the network if the network is

54
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,330
transparent about what's going on has

55
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,850
potentially a lot more power over the

56
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,070
citizens so the people who use the

57
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">network so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a this is a plan for</font>

58
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the panopticon which is a prison that's</font>

59
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,030
designed so that a warden sitting in the

60
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,370
central tower of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prison can</font>

61
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,229
effectively see everybody in<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the</font>

62
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,530
cells around the outside so that allows

63
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:45,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">one or a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> small amount of people to</font>

64
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:48,299
the guards in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case to have control</font>

65
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">over a very large population I find that</font>

66
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,540
troubling and I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

67
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,130
the network where the smarts are at the

68
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,660
edges doesn't make it so that the center

69
00:05:53,130 --> 00:06:03,240
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> has control over those smarts</font>

70
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:04,830
at the edges so the next so so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

71
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,340
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about what goes on in the</font>

72
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,719
DNS we're often thinking about sort of

73
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,190
that is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> like little bits of</font>

74
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,590
metadata like what host names are you

75
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:15,780
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and that's associational host</font>

76
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:18,599
data so a request comes from you for a

77
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,190
particular name those names potentially

78
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,990
mean things and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just point out</font>

79
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,460
that like associational surveillance is

80
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,050
actually probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most sophisticated</font>

81
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">form surveillance that we have</font>

82
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,340
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about global</font>

83
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,300
surveillance the it feels creepy to

84
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,400
think of somebody knowing what you're

85
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,849
saying but actually the things that

86
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,770
machines can learn at scale are

87
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:39,840
significantly more<font color="#E5E5E5"> powerful these days</font>

88
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,940
than just content analysis and so this

89
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,429
associational so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a slide from</font>

90
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,629
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> elite side from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the NSA their only</font>

91
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,020
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups who are doing certain</font>

92
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:51,210
like intense associational surveillance

93
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,440
but the the kind of associational

94
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,590
surveillance they can do is mapping

95
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,900
particular people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to particular groups</font>

96
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:59,940
so you can imagine with the DNS the

97
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:03,330
mapping the sorts of mappings that could

98
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,650
go on like did you visit Alcoholics

99
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,300
Anonymous that well that tells somebody

100
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,580
something so whoever<font color="#E5E5E5"> controls the</font>

101
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,870
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> has an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity to know if</font>

102
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,030
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just watching</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what traffic goes</font>

103
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:14,370
on what sorts of people have connected

104
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">to what sorts of groups so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS is</font>

105
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:22,139
part of that so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font>

106
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:25,378
slide so it's also not just host names

107
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,639
right the DNS has we think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as most</font>

108
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:28,620
commonly it's just we're going to look

109
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,789
up an address from the name but there's

110
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,099
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that can be stored</font>

111
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:33,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS and if you look around what's</font>

112
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:36,659
going on at the ITF there are a bunch of

113
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,759
other opportunities to use the DNS that

114
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:40,289
are not just host names they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

115
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,479
widely used of course as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font>

116
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:43,830
lookups that we're all familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> with but</font>

117
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,330
in fact there's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other stuff</font>

118
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,840
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming down the pike there's old</font>

119
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,609
stuff like MX records which which will

120
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,130
actually leaked information about what

121
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,330
what domain you're emailing to and then

122
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,250
there's things like Oakland pgp key

123
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,109
where you might actually end up sending

124
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:01,680
the name of whoever you're contacting

125
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:04,080
directly at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS so or another name</font>

126
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,879
but the individual email account which

127
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,750
is sniffing larger privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> leak so</font>

128
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,449
there's a bunch of other stuff that

129
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">could go on in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS and people want</font>

130
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:13,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use the DNS for that and so we need</font>

131
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:15,508
to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that DNS queries aren't as</font>

132
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:21,419
obviously subject to associational

133
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:22,919
surveillance and so so just just to sort

134
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">of reinforce why I think the social</font>

135
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,750
control issue is a thing here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

136
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:29,669
a study that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was done i think this this</font>

137
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,750
year at the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this year where</font>

138
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:33,149
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically took a bunch of people</font>

139
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">and they asked them their opinion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

140
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:37,500
some topics that were fairly contentious

141
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,279
and then they asked them their opinion

142
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,659
of about

143
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:44,579
the sentence is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like basically it's</font>

144
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:47,519

145
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:48,839
it turns out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a long</font>

146
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,399
lines of<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're not worried about it</font>

148
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,800
nothing to worry about right there's a

149
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,809
lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who have that sort of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">instinctive response in turn of the</font>

151
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:58,889
people who say if you're not you know

152
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,970
I've got nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hide I'm not worried</font>

153
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:01,889
about surveillance surveillance<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

154
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,870
justified to eat society safe the people

155
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:05,550
who say that when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to things</font>

156
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">where they are in the minority where</font>

157
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,258
they feel like they are more in conflict

158
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:11,819
they're actually less likely to speak up

159
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:13,829
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually an ecosystem problem</font>

160
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:15,990
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that we have all of this</font>

161
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:17,849
additional leakage means that people are

162
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,459
less likely to dissent and our society

163
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,230
is less<font color="#CCCCCC"> likely to be able to evolve so</font>

164
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,459
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the like these are different</font>

165
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,839
groups of people who have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

166
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:27,119
opinions about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the legitimacy of</font>

167
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,550
surveillance and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the graph here shows</font>

168
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,600
friendly neutral and hostile so if you

169
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">think you're saying something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into a</font>

170
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,180
hostile environment and you think

171
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:36,269
surveillance is okay you're actually

172
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,949
less likely to speak up at all so if

173
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:39,420
there's a chilling factor of having the

174
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:41,279
centralized surveillance so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

175
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">just about are you individually</font>

176
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,970
concerned about being spied on it's

177
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,680
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what can society do you as like</font>

178
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,000
how to society change has a behavior

179
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,128
change as a result of having this so we

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,110
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make protocols that encourage</font>

181
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:54,569
people to not to feel that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

182
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,920
projected so that they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

183
00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:56,910
communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with people even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in an</font>

184

185
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:03,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel like it's house island Ragnar and I</font>

186
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,800
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point out that DNS is one little</font>

187
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece of these leakages right so this is</font>

188
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,329
a boat here dns is leaking in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle</font>

189
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:11,759
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the boat but there's leaks coming</font>

190
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:14,099
from the TLS layer the server name

191
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,110
indication in TLS leaks there's leaks

192
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,509
from the traffic size of different kinds

193
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,829
of packets that you send timing patterns

194
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:22,649
there's probably lots of other leaks

195
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:24,989
that we don't know about and a lot of

196
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:28,589
times in IETF we're working in these

197
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,120
little silos and I've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> in multiple</font>

198
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:31,439
situations people say oh well we don't

199
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to worry about that leakage because</font>

200
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:35,429
it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> as bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as this other legal</font>

201
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,259
just happening somewhere else well in a

202
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:39,389
leaky boat scenario you actually need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

203
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:41,309
fix all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the leaks you can't just say I'm</font>

204
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:43,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">not going to fix my leak because this</font>

205
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:45,540
other leak over here is leaking also

206
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:47,819
right we want the boat to stay afloat so

207
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,040
the motivation here is to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

208
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:51,628
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually get I mean</font>

209
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,079
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of work ahead of us we</font>

210
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:53,850
actually

211
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,110
these are theoretical concerns and some

212
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,460
of these like the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> marks there</font>

213
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">are real question marks like these are</font>

214
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,030
there's ongoing academic research about

215
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,470
what kind of information can be

216
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,819
determined<font color="#E5E5E5"> from things like timing</font>

217
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,440
patterns and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have all the</font>

218
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,610
answers but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know that if we don't fix</font>

219
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,870
the things that we know how to fix we're

220
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,430
not going to get to all of them so

221
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's just a motivation for why we care</font>

222
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,339
about DNS privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not going to</font>

223
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,710
solve all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems but it's a step</font>

224
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">in that direction so get back to serve</font>

225
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thank you very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much so I hope</font>

226
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's given you a flavor for some of</font>

227
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,310
the context of what we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

228
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:46,650
today so what I first<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to do is</font>

229
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:48,420
before we dive right d into what's been

230
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,430
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS well it's talk a little</font>

231
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,939
bit about what's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening at the</font>

232
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:55,050
ITF level in general in terms of privacy

233
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,900
now of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course the Snowden revelations</font>

234
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:00,120
were a big thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it got popular</font>

235
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,819
awareness about mass surveillance and

236
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,560
out there a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of tend</font>

237
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,240
to think that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of caught the ITF</font>

238
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,250
napping but what I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to illustrate</font>

239
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,680
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really really isn't true</font>

240
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,750
the ITF was very actively involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

241
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,150
all sorts of privacy work well before

242
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:19,950
that there were numerous workshops and

243
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:22,740
quite importantly in<font color="#E5E5E5"> March 2011 work was</font>

244
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,750
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a draft that was to guide</font>

245
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,150
protocol developers on how to add

246
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,400
privacy considerations into their dress

247
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:31,590
in a very similar manner as to the way

248
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,439
security considerations are quite

249
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:36,900
naturally put in drafts so the folks

250
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,550
behind that started back in 2011 and

251
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,680
they were right on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the verge of getting</font>

252
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:45,060
it published as<font color="#E5E5E5"> an RC when Edward</font>

these guys a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave me were</font>

256
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:54,209
Thunder stolen there but what the IDF

257
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:57,120
did is it came back swinging it very

258
00:12:54,210 --> 00:13:01,170
quickly reacted with a very important

259
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:04,380
document which is RFC 7258 and this

260
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,180
declares clearly a pervasive monitoring

<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font>

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:26,000
in the ITF with regards to privacy I

270
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:30,439
just wanted to pull out just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of</font>

statements from roc 2558 in terms of

clarifying that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> iits position on</font>

273
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:38,140
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that pervasive monitoring is an</font>

attack on internet users and

275
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:43,220
organizations and the declared aim in

276
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:45,680
future protocol developments is to

277
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:48,650
mitigate the effects of monitoring

278
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,270
through protocol design so doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at</font>

296
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:43,670
were availability redundancy and also

speed so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that for</font>

298
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:48,890
most in the people who are developing

the protocol in previously turns the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:54,800
is described as an enabler it's a system

that you use to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to other services</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

302
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,910
you want to get to a web page you go via

go via the DNS so that's where it sits

305
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:07,730
now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun it was still true of the</font>

306
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:11,900

309
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,190
of the traffic going up to the route

310
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:22,250
went over UDP and importantly

311
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:24,890
this is clear text so all you're doing

312
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:27,440
as queries are going clear text over the

313
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:29,390
internet so this meant this was fair

314
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,090
game for somebody like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NSA with the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">really only used for corner cases there</font>

321
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,050
was also at this time and for much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

322
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:54,020
these sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 25 year time period here</font>

323
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:56,930
that I'm spanning a perception that the

00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:58,970
dearness is public right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean anybody</font>

325
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,859
can query these records anybody can get

326
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,560
to them they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't contain personal</font>

327
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,630
sensitive information so we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

328
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,819
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about encrypting this or</font>

329
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:11,439
protecting it in any way<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the dns</font>

330
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:14,420
and that was out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a long time</font>

331
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,010
so you have to bear those things in mind

332
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,709
when you look at the design of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the deer</font>

333
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:21,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">and ass be a bit forgiving so this is</font>

334
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:25,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">the basics of how the dns works you're</font>

335
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,349
on some client machine you want to

336
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,819
resolve a name you send the full name up

337
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,820
to the recursive server that you're

338
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,830
using now what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS does is if it</font>

339
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:37,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't have that name in cash it sends</font>

340
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:40,070
the entire name up to a root server to

341
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:43,640
get a delegation for in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot</font>

342
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:46,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">org then it sends the entire query to</font>

343
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,170
the doctor or authoritative server and

344
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,270
so on down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chain until it gets to</font>

345
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:53,360
the one that can provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer now</font>

346
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:55,760
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> hindsight with and your privacy hat</font>

347
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,100
on you look at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go oh that</font>

348
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,920
infamous bad idea ferry was around when

349
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:03,650
they thought of this right because those

350
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,810
new queries are leaking information who

351
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:08,750
at root needs to know the full question

352
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:10,879
that the client asked they don't need to

353
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:14,260
in order to resolve it but this was how

354
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,260
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS was designed originally</font>

355
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:22,130
something else interesting happened just

356
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:23,689
about this<font color="#CCCCCC"> time frame as well 2013 and</font>

357
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,959
that was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standardization of a</font>

358
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:28,580
mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> called Eden s0 now this was a</font>

359
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,280
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice idea and something the DNS</font>

360
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,020
really needed it enabled embedding

361
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,280
information inside dns

362
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,480
that was flexible it could contain

363
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,700
capability options it could allow

364
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,560
clients and<font color="#E5E5E5"> services to negotiate things</font>

365
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,830
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> paths empty use it was great the</font>

366
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:48,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">dearness needed it as a side effect</font>

367
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:53,270
though what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> did is it enabled</font>

368
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:55,820
certain organizations to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage</font>

369
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:58,910
of this to embed user data directly

370
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:01,159
inside those DNS queries but the way

371
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:03,950
this was positioned at the time was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

372
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,050
it was all for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the greater good so for</font>

00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:09,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">example one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mechanisms here was</font>

your kids or even more sophisticated

00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,590
filtering and we can do this is how

378
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:24,650
recursos if we know who's making those

379
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:25,990
queries similarly<font color="#CCCCCC"> cdns argued that if we</font>

381
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:30,800
geographically we can divert you to your

<font color="#E5E5E5">this means in practice so the way the</font>

389
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,860
user identification worked is that your

00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:05,300
cases it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was observed that it was</font>

396
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:07,639
usernames or user IDs something unique

397
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:10,010
and that meant they could do their

398
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,530
filtering<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recursive but it also meant</font>

399
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,600
that anybody who is passively monitoring

400
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that link could immediately correlate</font>

401
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:20,570
all those queries with activities of

402
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:22,550
individuals behind that router so that

403
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,530
could allow not only for identification

404
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:27,470
of individuals but<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracking of</font>

405
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:30,560
individuals as well in a very similar

406
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:33,110
manner the way the client subnet worked

407
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,210
was that there was an implementation in

408
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:38,360
the recursive that said well we know who

409
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:40,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">centers this query pick up the subnet</font>

410
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,560
and send that<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the authoritative so</font>

411
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:44,570
it can figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out their geolocation but</font>

412
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">again this is leaking information to</font>

413
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:48,830
anybody passively monitoring

414
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,510
that link up to the authoritative again

415
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,970
creating correlations within the data

416
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:56,270
with the activity of users or groups of

417
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:57,920
users so what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really means is even</font>

418
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:59,629
when you're sat at home you're behind in

419

that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anonymity</font>

originally with non-standard options

00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,700
some of them are now coming through the

<font color="#CCCCCC">wasn't anything to stop organizations</font>

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,820
doing this because people happy to sign

429
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:25,580
up to the services which sounded great

430
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:27,169
and there's dkg alluded to the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

431
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:30,320
cruise you do reveal quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

432
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:32,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">you on both of these legs so I don't</font>

433
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,399
know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> me but I'm home before I came</font>

434
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,590
here I was looking up what conference I

435
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,720
was going to hotel I was staying a hat

436
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:40,699
with flight so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was taking so this</font>

437
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,920
reveals an awful lot about me including

438
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,360
how abstracted I can get when I'm trying

439
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">to put a big slide deck together and</font>

440
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,959
what sites i go wandering off ting but

441
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:52,129
this is all information they can

442
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,870
correlate back to me so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hope at this</font>

443
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,640
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've got your spidey sense is</font>

444
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,830
tingling with the idea that there's all

445
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,630
sorts of stuff going on in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dns that</font>

446
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,639
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily know about an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

447
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:05,929
user even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're quite technically</font>

448
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:08,390
aware so take this another step<font color="#E5E5E5"> further</font>

449
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:10,490
so we've looked at the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of leakages</font>

450
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:12,950
you get on DNS queries that are in

451
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:16,640
flight this is thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them at</font>

452
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:18,620
rest so you have a recursive resolve

453
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,480
that you're using so you have to start

454
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,909
considering who are the people who have

455
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,140
authorized access to the data there to

456
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,900
what's been blogged about all the

457
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:28,670
queries coming in what's their parties

458
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,470
are they sharing it with what legal

459
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:33,080
commitments do they have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> gather</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

460
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:35,870
on users equally what are the risks of

461
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,520
unauthorized access to that data how

462
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:40,850
solid is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security could there be</font>

463
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,530
breaches and also those concerns will

464
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:45,740
change as you move around different

465
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:47,120
curses<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I sure at home or at work as</font>

468
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:54,409
people aren't necessarily aware of

469
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,990
equally<font color="#E5E5E5"> those concerns extend up to your</font>

470
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:58,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">thority tips because as you can see</font>

471
00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:01,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">information can make it up to that level</font>

472
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,780
about the activity of individuals

473
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:07,400
so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of salient points</font>

474
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:08,929
about DNS data leakage there are an

475
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,520
awful lot of complications I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

476
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:12,049
just touch on one here which is

477
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,549
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> which particularly lately has</font>

478
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:17,418
become more active and that's Dennis

479
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:19,610
filtering so this is happening a country

482
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,690
running with curses will have a black

00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,490
list of sites they don't want people to

484

00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:41,720
from websites infected with malware etc

489
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:44,090
although accidentally some other sites

490
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,429
get blocked every now and again that you

491
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:49,189
might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to like Google this</font>

492
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:51,409
has happened by accident um but the

493
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:53,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing to think about is if you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

494
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:56,179
your cursor that engages in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of</font>

495
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:57,799
behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> with these black lists how</font>

496
00:22:56,179 --> 00:23:01,309
likely do you think they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> to track</font>

497
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:03,260
users who trigger they're blocking do to

498
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:07,850
try to access one of these flat listed

499
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:09,919
sites<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you do it by accident so</font>

500
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:12,110
this table tries to summarize the

501
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">hotspots in terms of DNS data leak we</font>

502
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:17,510
leakage in terms of what's happening on

503
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">the wire and at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rest and I'll come back</font>

504
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:25,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">to this later and show you where we are</font>

505
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:27,140
in terms of tackling this so that's a

506
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture in classic dns as you know it i</font>

507
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,710
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend just a little bit of time</font>

508
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:34,400
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about something which is called</font>

509
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:38,210
dns service discovery so this happens

510
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,610
within local networks and the mechanisms

511
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,809
used can be regular<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS constrained to</font>

512
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:44,928
that local network or it can be

513
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:46,549
multicast DNS what this does is

514
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:48,710
essentially the procedure whereby a

515
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:53,270
device can advertise some services that

516
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:55,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is willing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make public and other</font>

517
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:58,100
devices can discover those services and

518
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,659
use them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is really cool because</font>

519
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,699
it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do stuff like file</font>

520
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:04,610
sharing photo sharing all sorts of stuff

521
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">directly over the network that's nice</font>

522
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:09,439
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the services that utilize</font>

523
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:12,530
this are secure the problem comes in

524
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,970
advertising those services now I can see

525
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,620
a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of max here</font>

526
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,600
and I know that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you simply just open</font>

527
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:21,169
finder and look in your sidebar you can

528
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,030
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a whole load</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of devices</font>

529
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:26,270
advertised I bet a whole bunch of them

530
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:28,040
have names or identifies in them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

531
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:30,379
very typically the kind of thing you

532
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,200
might see is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this Stewart</font>

533
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,810
I was going to add<font color="#CCCCCC"> one pedantic point</font>

534
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,340
you said this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is on the local network</font>

535
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:39,649
but it's not it's on the global network

536
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:41,270
sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> here at the ITF if you tap the</font>

537
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:44,480
air print button on your phone it'll do

538
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:47,600
a query for IP p t CP doc meeting that

539
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,150
ITF dog dog hey which will go across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

540
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,669
Pacific to Virginia or wherever the

authoritative server is for IETF dog

542
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:57,440
yeah I student just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the this</font>

543
00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:01,970
service advertisement is typically

544
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,500
constrained to thee<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh local well you're</font>

545
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,630
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're giving</font>

547
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:10,280
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh what I was saying is when you do</font>

548
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,290
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> over unicast it's going over the</font>

public<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet in the clear unencrypted</font>

550
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:15,950
every time you tap the air print button

00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,139
on your phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and printed documents on</font>

552
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:19,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">the terminal room printer here yeah even</font>

553
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,040
though you're printing it on a printer

554
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:23,930
down the hallway you're sending a query

555
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,270
to the US and back to ask for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

556
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:28,070
address of that printer right I mean I'm

557
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:31,280
assuming the authoritative server for

558
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:39,460
IETF torgus not isn't it hotel somewhere

559
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:41,360
else thank you so in terms of

560
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,690
advertising what you're doing here and

561
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:49,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">leaking information the problem comes</font>

562
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:50,810
with um the way this information<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

563
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:53,540
advertising the amount of detail it

564
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:54,860
contains so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might quite</font>

565
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:58,399
easily see this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information</font>

advertised from an individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> user and</font>

567
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,250
you think well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what they want to</font>

568
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,810
share<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff they're willing to make</font>

569
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,520
it public but think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what you've</font>

570
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:06,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">learned by Alice just from this</font>

00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,150
room and say they're only handful of

573
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,830
females and only one has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop open</font>

574
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,800
then suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got a really good</font>

575
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:18,169
idea of who Alice<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually is you also</font>

576
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,669
know that she's got two devices and you

577
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:22,130
know she's willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share photos and</font>

578
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:24,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">that she uses a chat application that</font>

579
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,940
supports presence so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only do you</font>

580
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">know a bit about her but what you've got</font>

581
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,610
is a fingerprint here so you can

582
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,590
see this fingerprint as it moves around

583
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:34,469
networks and that means you've got user

584
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:37,530
tracking capabilities and this goes

585
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:40,860
beyond tracking user it can go deep dive

586
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:44,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">into exposing information about for</font>

587
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:47,370
example when you advertise these

588
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,050
services you also often advertised

589
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:51,330
attributes<font color="#E5E5E5"> about them so for example</font>

590
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:53,540
which ports they use which<font color="#E5E5E5"> purse it says</font>

591
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,820
you they use lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of details and</font>

592
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:58,379
intelligent attackers it has been shown

593
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:00,600
can actually use this to determine

594
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,370
things like which software version you

595
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,770
are running and therefore that means

596
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:07,979
they might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect known</font>

597
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:09,570
exploits in unpatched software similarly

598
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,580
they can actually dive right down to

599
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:14,550
specific devices if they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font>

600
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:17,340
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> so again this is leakage of</font>

601
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:19,260
personal information that non-technical

602
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">users are probably very unaware of and</font>

603
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:25,740
even technical users might not

604
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:27,870
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> the full gravity of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

605
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,990
what I wanted to do quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just say</font>

606
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:32,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay say back then if he were savvy to</font>

your choices at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time there were a</font>

609
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,740
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things available DNS curve was</font>

610
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,270
around for a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> while dear script</font>

611
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,640
was developed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's still around</font>

612
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:48,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are a number of implementations so</font>

613
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,100
and in fact opened in us offer that as a

614
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:53,730
mechanism when you use their resolvers

615
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:55,800
um what I do want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spell out though is</font>

616
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:58,590
that the real motivation<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind these</font>

617
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:00,330
mechanisms was authentication of the

618
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,429
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchanged between clients</font>

619
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:05,639
and servers so it was about anti

620
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:07,770
spoofing and anti dosing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the privacy</font>

621
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,320
benefits largely came as a side effect

622
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:12,270
because crypto is used to achieve that

623
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,720
these weren't first and foremost

624
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:18,510
priority mechanisms to protect users

625
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,610
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> although these were documented</font>

626
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:23,790
neither actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> made it to through the</font>

627
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:26,070
standards process other things that

628
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:27,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">people were doing some people chose to</font>

629
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:30,360
run local resolvers on their machines

630
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,100
and the main aim here was to bypass

631
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,320
those intermediate recursos so you

632
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,730
weren't exposing your data to them it

633
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,710
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve the whole problem because</font>

634
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're then exposing your client address</font>

635
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,789
directly to the authoritative but some

636
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:46,070
people felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a better choice but</font>

637
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:48,899
than using an intermediate recur sir

638
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:50,939
also what came out around this time was

639
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:53,039
a talk of dearness trigger now again<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

640
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,950
motivation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to enable DNS</font>

641
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,139
SEC on an end user computer and the

642
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:00,090
privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspects were a byproduct but</font>

643
00:28:58,139 --> 00:29:04,439
what it did was it used as a last ditch

644
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:05,908
attempt DNS over TLS on port 443 but

645
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,999
what this did mean is there was an

646
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:11,460
implementation of encrypted DNS out in

647
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:13,679
the wild that some users were able to

648
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:18,019
monopolize and use for<font color="#CCCCCC"> their own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ends to</font>

649
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:21,690
do private DNS even at this early stage

650
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:23,879
so having talked about the historical

651
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:26,039
context for this I wanted to move on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

652
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:29,309
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what's been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happening in the</font>

653
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:30,899
most in the recent years<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when the</font>

654
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:33,509
main places this work has happened is

655
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:36,090
the deprived working group and this was

656
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:38,789
created<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 2014 in the wake of the</font>

657
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:40,949
Snowden revelations and the desire by

658
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:44,519
the IETF to mitigate monitoring through

659
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:46,769
protocol design now this had no small

660
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:49,440
task before it you're talking about

661
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:52,169
taking the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS which has been a bass</font>

662
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,179
rock of the internet for 30-some years

663
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:56,340
and worked in largely the same way<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

664
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:58,679
all those<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30-some years and what you</font>

665
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:01,168
have to magically do sprinkle it with a

666
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:02,759
layer of privacy with minimal impact and

667
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:06,809
try not to disrupt the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet while</font>

668
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:08,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do it so where do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start well</font>

669
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:10,259
this was a big problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what the</font>

670
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:13,470
working group decided in its initial

671
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:17,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">charter was to focus solely on the stub</font>

672
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:19,529
to recursive and step of this and there

673
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,830
are various<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons for this to our</font>

674
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:25,739
summarize our one is that that stub to

675
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:27,749
recursive stage leaks the most

676
00:30:25,739 --> 00:30:29,039
information so if you can tackle that

677
00:30:27,749 --> 00:30:32,849
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long way towards helping</font>

678
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,408
and users secondly the recursive<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

679
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:36,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">authoritative stayed it's quite</font>

680
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:38,249
challenging when you come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

681
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,559
how you're going to do authentication of

682
00:30:38,249 --> 00:30:43,830
connections in that environment and the

683
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:45,269
reason is this if you're an<font color="#CCCCCC"> end-user you</font>

684
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:49,019
your relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> with recursive</font>

685
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:51,389
services is one to a few you have the

686
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:53,070
one use at home work when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're asking</font>

687
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:55,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">about but generally you either have a</font>

688
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:57,870
relationship with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> recursive resolve</font>

689
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,149
or you make a conscious choice to use it

690
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:02,969
by going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a captive portal joining a</font>

691
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:05,430
network whatever whereas if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

692
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:07,530
recursive server your job is to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

693
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:10,650
all and any authoritative servers that

694
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:12,570
you need to in order to resolve a name

695
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:15,030
that you have been asked for and many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

696
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:18,060
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may never ever talk to you</font>

697
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:21,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">before so that makes authenticating the</font>

698
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:23,250
one too many unknowns difficult so think

699
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,990
of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit like your phone</font>

700
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:30,900
contacts compared to your Twitter

701
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:32,550
followers who do you know best so the

702
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:35,880
first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the working group did</font>

703
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:40,050
is it decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to enumerate the problem</font>

704
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:42,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">space and it produced RFC 7626 now this</font>

705
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:44,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">is highly recommended read it basically</font>

706
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:46,590
goes through the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of situations that</font>

707
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,900
I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the first part of</font>

708
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:50,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion here today but in much more</font>

709
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:53,190
detail and it also goes through other

710
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:54,810
cases of leakage so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really worth</font>

711
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,990
looking at to understand the details of

712
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:59,940
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I'm really key thing</font>

713
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:03,330
that this document does though is it

714
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:06,030
robots the alleged public nature of the

715
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:09,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS and the distinction it makes is that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">yes the data in the DNS might be public</font>

717
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:17,550
but an individual DNS transaction is not

718
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:19,830
and should not be public so to use the

719
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:21,500
same example as earlier and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

720
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:24,270
actually directly taken from this RFC

the fact that you as an individual do

00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:35,370
the DNS requests to get that record is

729
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:49,500
problem we now start looking at

730
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,630
solutions and there were various ones

731
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,060
that could have been looked at some of

732
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:56,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">the well-known technologies some dns</font>

733
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:58,260
specific solutions were offered as well

734
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:01,320
and drafts on all of these came forward

735
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group at the time the</font>

736
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,700
ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that got really serious</font>

737
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,110
consideration with these three starts

738
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,270
here less initially seemed very

739
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:11,340
attractive it could be done on port 50

740
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:13,320
three it could be incrementally deployed

741
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:17,159
it was a known technique that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was all</font>

742
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:19,439
nice on downside though obviously the

743
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:22,140
negotiation can be susceptible to a

744
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,860
downgrade attack that negotiation can

745
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:30,000
also introduce latency and l word that

746
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:31,649
Diaz folks really don't like and there

747
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,390
was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sort of big question mark</font>

748
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:36,120
about hang on there's all these Reuters

749
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:37,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that get DNS traffic on port 53 are they</font>

750
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,360
certainly going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> freak out if they</font>

751
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:41,820
start seeing encrypted traffic and just

752
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:45,409
block it Oh again I have real deployment

753
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:47,520
problems here it was none known so

754
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:49,830
discussion moved on to looking at doing

755
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:54,389
tearless or detail s over a brand new

756
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:57,439
port if we could get<font color="#E5E5E5"> one now if we could</font>

757
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:58,980
TLS is you know a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-known</font>

758
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology there's a lot of</font>

759
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,180
implementations it's quite widely

760
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:05,220
deployed so that was attractive there

761
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:08,370
were some concerns about scalability of

762
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:10,679
it if you try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS and</font>

763
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:12,330
then in some ways you might want to look

764
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:15,090
at detail s and say well isn't that a

765
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:19,168
more natural solution for DNS because

766
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:22,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's UDP based and initially it you</font>

767
00:34:19,168 --> 00:34:25,560
might think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> however it runs into</font>

768
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:27,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same problem that UDP does and the</font>

769
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,299
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's this scattering of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp</font>

770
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:33,300
around which is that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer to a</font>

771
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:37,110
DNS query is too big to fit within the

772
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:39,510
MTU then the server<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to indicate the</font>

773
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:41,280
client it needs to retry over<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font>

774
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:44,130
because you can send<font color="#E5E5E5"> that large response</font>

775
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,740
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP the same problem happens over</font>

00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:49,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">dtls if the response</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> won't fit in the</font>

777
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:51,569
packet the server cannot send the whole

778
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:53,760
spawns and it has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> request client to</font>

779
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:55,620
retry over another mechanism when you're

780
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,810
dealing to privacy that means if you

781
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:01,440
want to maintain privacy you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to use</font>

782
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:03,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">another protocol like TLS all you have</font>

783
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,420
to completely sacrifice your privacy and

784
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:09,000
retry over clear text so the upshot of

785
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:11,040
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that detail asked couldn't be a</font>

786
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">standalone solution to DNS previously</font>

787
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:18,650
you had to do dns over TLS regardless if

788
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,650
you wanted a deployable solution

789
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:24,160
so in that case it meant we had to

790
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:26,350
revisit what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> with dns tcp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

791
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,049
mean some people sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shocked shocked</font>

792
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:32,440
to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that tcp amused for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dns at all</font>

793
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:35,020
but it was but not in such a great way

794
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,990
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason was a historical one it</font>

795
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:40,330
was that clients took the easy route and

796
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:42,850
if they were doing lots of UDP queries

797
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:45,700
and they got this signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say you need</font>

798
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:48,150
to retry the TTP they would do one shot

799
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:50,319
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp and go straight back to UDP and</font>

800
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:53,740
that was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pattern that clients</font>

801
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,450
implemented across the dns so on the

802
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,220
server side the service were all sitting

803
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:59,410
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> going well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really have to</font>

804
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:03,700
worry about TCP<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna get one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> query</font>

805
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:05,950
you know every now and again so servers

806
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:08,740
had very basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP capabilities</font>

807
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:11,770
operators didn't routinely worry about

808
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:14,410
tuning for<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp or bust us against</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

809
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,640
attacks so you know it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in some</font>

810
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:26,230
ways at this point treated as a

00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:29,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">second-class protocol oh sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lykos in</font>

00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:32,170
fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm completely wrong slide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

813
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:34,210
we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and deal with tcp /</font>

814
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:37,780
TLS implementations at a later point in

815
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:41,530
time another<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem that we will have</font>

816
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:43,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">to deal with is authentication so what</font>

817
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:46,270
do most other protocols do when they

818
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:48,700
want to authenticate something hmm they

819
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:52,390
do a DNS lookup first so we're gonna

820
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:53,620
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get around that in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS the</font>

821
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,270
other thing to worry about is some

822
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:57,339
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting work that was done on</font>

823
00:36:55,270 --> 00:37:00,100
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> analysis and what this showed</font>

824
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:02,800
was great go ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> crypt your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

825
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:05,110
that's fine but if I'm an observer and I

826
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,780
can see both sides<font color="#CCCCCC"> are recursive then I</font>

827
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:09,490
can see lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of messages I can still</font>

828
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:11,620
figure out how big they are and I can

829
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:13,660
still see the timing correlations

830
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:16,509
between them which means with a bit of

831
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:19,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">work I can still do sol bunch of stuff</font>

832
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:21,910
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what individual users are doing so</font>

833
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:24,069
just encrypting traffic is not enough to

834
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:25,540
obfuscate that so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> consider</font>

835
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:28,350
options that can defeat that kind of

836
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,350
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis</font>

837
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so top of that list was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

838
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:37,870
your port how easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that well it turns</font>

839
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:41,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">out if you have a really solid use case</font>

840
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:44,859
which this was it's pretty easy we asked

841
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:47,590
and we got fantastic so a year ago port

842
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:53,800
853 was assigned for use for encrypted

843
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:58,330
DNS who our next problem deal with this

844
00:37:53,800 --> 00:38:01,690
issue with DNS over<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP to enable TLS</font>

845
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:03,549
over TLS so this wasn't an

846
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:07,660
insurmountable problem it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

847
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:09,130
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> engineering so what</font>

848
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,859
do we do well we throw the kitchen sink

849
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:14,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">at it or you know it's matt damon mike</font>

850
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:19,330
said we need to science the hmm out of

851
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:21,130
this so what we do is you look at all

852
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,779
the techniques that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are used in all the</font>

853
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:25,480
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocols that use these and you</font>

854
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:27,610
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure to introduce them into the DNS</font>

855
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:30,340
space in the standards so for example

856
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:32,050
when DNS clients and servers assessing

857
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:34,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">at connections you need to make sure</font>

00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:36,400
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> techniques like fast</font>

859
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:37,930
open session resumption and you want to

860
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,400
have a really close eye on till s 1

861
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,740
point 3 because that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do good</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">things in terms of reducing latency for</font>

00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:46,029
setting up these connections when you

set the connections up you want to stop

this behavior<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one shot tcp you want</font>

866
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,710
to recommend that clients once<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a</font>

867
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,390
connection open they pipeline their

868
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:57,880
queries over it not waiting for

869
00:38:55,390 --> 00:39:01,029
responses just send them that when the

870
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:03,520
server gets them it actually processes

871
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:06,100
them concurrently not see really<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

872
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,590
that when it gets the responses it sends

00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:10,540
them as soon as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it gets it now that will</font>

874
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:12,790
sounds really obvious but that is not

875
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:15,700
what dn.m implementations have done

876
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:17,650
historically so work was done to ensure

877
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:20,080
that in the standards this was how

878
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:22,690
implementations should mature moving

879
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,430
forward you'll also note there's a

880
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:26,800
persistent connections are see here

881
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:29,710
until last year there was no standard

882
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,660
way for a DNS client and a DNS server to

883
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:34,540
agree that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do persistent</font>

885
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:40,270
now also in terms of managing TCP

886
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,920
connections on a DNS server then there's

887
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:43,690
there's a huge amount that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:23,050
this was just a little little

illustration of sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad to NSO tcp</font>

901
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:32,980
where we want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so having done</font>

902
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:36,400
some work on that we now move on to

903
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:38,130
authentication the work that's going

904
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,930
through deprived at the moment has

905
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:44,410
attempted to present<font color="#CCCCCC"> two profiles</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

906
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:46,299
order to clarify to users what security

907
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:47,859
they can expect when they use one of

908
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,890
these two profiles because this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

909
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:53,759
of a new idea to DNS users so at the

910
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:57,069
moment what specified are two profiles

911
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,740
strict San opportunistic so the strict

912
00:40:57,069 --> 00:41:03,310
profile is one where as a client you

913
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:05,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">decide that if I'm going to do Dennis I</font>

914
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:08,200
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get an encrypted connection and</font>

915
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:10,089
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to authenticate my server and if</font>

916
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,310
I can't do both those things then I am

917
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:15,099
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> prepared to compromise my privacy so</font>

918
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:18,339
I just won't do dns resolution and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

919
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:20,440
can't get to the internet but that is

920
00:41:18,339 --> 00:41:22,509
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying my privacy is more</font>

921
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,910
important than my connectivity and

922
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:28,780
that's a choice<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make as a user so</font>

923
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:30,279
it's kind of a purist take on if you

924
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:32,530
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of it as kind of</font>

925
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,180
Jedi way of doing this I've let the

926
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:36,940
words of Master Yoda described the

927
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:39,848
philosopher here and whereas the

928
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:42,730
opportunistic profile is much more

929
00:41:39,849 --> 00:41:44,650
pragmatic it's I really like the idea

930
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:47,290
Innis privacy and I think it's important

931
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:50,200
i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try every mechanism i can</font>

932
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:52,960
to do it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end of the day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am</font>

933
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:55,750
willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to clear text in order to</font>

934
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,509
get connectivity and again that's just a

935
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:59,939
usage profile for users

936
00:41:57,509 --> 00:42:02,369
to make depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what they consider</font>

937
00:41:59,939 --> 00:42:06,479
important in terms of exposing their dns

938
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:08,839
queries when they use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet so</font>

939
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:11,638
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is something were</font>

940
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:13,949
opportunistic is a stepping<font color="#E5E5E5"> stone to</font>

941
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:16,499
everybody being enabled to do strict and

942
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:22,019
it's not an issue but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's something</font>

943
00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:24,238
<font color="#E5E5E5">firs to determine as we roll this out so</font>

944
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:26,399
how do you do this authentication well

945
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:28,529
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now there are two ways specified</font>

946
00:42:26,399 --> 00:42:31,288
one that starts off from a domain name

947
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:35,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">and one that starts off from an SP ki</font>

948
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:38,639
pin set now if you're out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there you're</font>

949
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:41,130
thinking okay these the DNS folks and

950
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,809
aren't these the folks that tell every

951
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:45,529
other protocol if you want to do

952
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:49,559
authentication you should be using Dane

953
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:53,099
so shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we be kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of eating our</font>

954
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:56,249
own dog food here well yes so we do

955
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:58,679
specify how to do an authentication by

956
00:42:56,249 --> 00:43:00,839
day but<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really interesting idea came</font>

957
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:02,669
out of the work on this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

958
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:06,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">got dinner servers involved in this</font>

959
00:43:02,669 --> 00:43:08,879
interaction so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very quick</font>

960
00:43:06,109 --> 00:43:11,729
demonstration of how it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> work using</font>

961
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:15,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of classical Dane so you start from</font>

962
00:43:11,729 --> 00:43:18,178
a DNS client that has DNS SEC validating

963
00:43:15,689 --> 00:43:21,959
capabilities you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure it with a</font>

964
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:23,369
domain name and<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP address and one of</font>

965
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:26,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bootstrapping problems here is that</font>

966
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:28,199
it may need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do opportunistic so not</font>

967
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:31,799
necessarily encrypted lookups to get

968
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:33,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">that information to start with again at</font>

969
00:43:31,799 --> 00:43:36,419
this point I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have a connection to</font>

970
00:43:33,259 --> 00:43:38,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">a privacy server so if I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

971
00:43:36,419 --> 00:43:41,729
those damn records that also has to be

972
00:43:38,759 --> 00:43:44,639
opportunistic so probably we encrypt it

973
00:43:41,729 --> 00:43:46,468
but not authenticated but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

974
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:48,959
off and talk to some resolver and get

975
00:43:46,469 --> 00:43:51,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">those records once I have those records</font>

976
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:54,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can used in a sec to validate them say</font>

977
00:43:51,539 --> 00:43:56,999
I'm good to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the client can start</font>

978
00:43:54,749 --> 00:43:59,669
the dl stls connection get the

979
00:43:56,999 --> 00:44:04,799
credentials from server validate them

980
00:43:59,669 --> 00:44:06,929
and dns resolution can start the

981
00:44:04,799 --> 00:44:09,389
alternative mechanism is one using

982
00:44:06,929 --> 00:44:10,450
something called the TLS<font color="#E5E5E5"> d in a sec</font>

983
00:44:09,389 --> 00:44:11,890
chain extension

984
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:14,980
this is a draft which is currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

985
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:16,779
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TLS working group what this</font>

986
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:19,660
does is it starts<font color="#E5E5E5"> from exactly the same</font>

987
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:22,510
point but it shifts the responsibility

988
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,950
for getting those damn records onto the

989
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:26,619
dearness privacy server because after

990
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:28,810
all it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS server it should know how</font>

991
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:31,240
to get them and it should it can

992
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:34,720
prefetch them and it can cash them or it

993
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:37,209
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them on demand in this case once</font>

994
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:40,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">that server has the records the client</font>

995
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:42,849
can then in the client hello indicate

1003
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:04,690
to validate your<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> records with doing</font>

1008
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:17,290
of this is that all that happened inside

1009
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:19,240
the TLS handshake in this case so what

1010
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:22,150
you avoid is the latency<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

1011
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:24,598
separate lookups by the client and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1012
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:26,920
also remove the need for a separate

1013
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:28,780
resolver that can provide the<font color="#E5E5E5"> date</font>

1014
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:33,700
records so the streamlines<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole</font>

solution space for the stub to recursive

1019
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:52,089
part of the problem so in May of this

1020
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:54,010
year 78 58 got it right that was

1021
00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:59,290
published which is a specification for

1022
00:45:54,010 --> 00:46:02,380
DNS over TLS alongside that 7830 was

1023
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:04,420
published which is the ed and I serum

1024
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:07,359
mechanism so that you can pad a DNS

1025
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:10,180
query by an amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's more</font>

1026
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:12,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">follow-up work to talk there about what</font>

1027
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:13,810
algorithms to use to pad that but at

1028
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,410
least we have the basic mechanism in

1029
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:18,849
place there's also a draft going through

1030
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:21,609
the working group which is completed

1031
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:24,250
working group last call to specify DNS

1032
00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:27,100
over TLS and

1033
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:30,550
there's a separate draft which is in

1034
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:32,770
working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> rascal to specify all the</font>

details of the authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> maxims</font>

1036
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:38,950
that I touched on earlier so this is

00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:41,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty good work for two years of a</font>

1038

00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:48,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">this wasn't an easy problem a lot of</font>

1040
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:50,919
progress has been made so what next now

1041
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:52,660
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start biting the bullet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1042
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,720
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the recursive to</font>

1043

<font color="#E5E5E5">Authority problem and in fact the</font>

1044
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,439
working group is meeting this Friday

1045
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,020
here in Seoul and one of the agenda

1046
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">items is the recharter discussion how do</font>

1047
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:07,000
we move forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> from where we are to</font>

1048
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:08,980
tackle this there is a draft available

1049
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,500
and what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> attempts to do is</font>

1050
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:13,540
enumerate six options for how to do that

1051
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,340
authentication between their curses and

1052
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:18,670
the authoritative and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also going</font>

1053
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:20,320
to be discussed in working group there's

1054
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:23,380
also quite a desire to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some data</font>

1055
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:26,140
from the experience of what it really

1056
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:28,390
means to do DNS over TLS on Stubbs

1057
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:29,830
recursive and feed that into<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

1058
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:31,690
about how to do that recursive to

1059
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:34,810
authoritative as well because this is

1060
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:36,580
new territory one thing I do want to

1061
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,590
touch on is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have an</font>

1062
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:40,569
encryption solution for recursive to

1063
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:43,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">authority yet but what came out of the</font>

1064
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:45,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">dns up working group is a nice piece of</font>

1065
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:47,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">work you know minimization so we go back</font>

1066
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:49,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this picture earlier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad idea</font>

1067
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:51,970
fairy said<font color="#CCCCCC"> leaked all your information</font>

1068
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:54,970
and we come along with an idea from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1069
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:57,700
better idea fairy who says well no you

1070
00:47:54,970 --> 00:48:00,430
don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just send what you need to</font>

1071
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:02,890
and stop leaking information now this

1072
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:06,009
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally trivial and it's not quite</font>

1073
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:07,930
as some<font color="#E5E5E5"> really icky corner cases in this</font>

1074
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:11,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you have to go following see names</font>

1075
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:14,049
and the like but the good news is those

1076
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:16,720
are being solved in implementations and

1077
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:19,150
this is now being rolled out into the

1078
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:24,790
major open source name<font color="#E5E5E5"> several</font>

1079
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:26,440
implementations today so i got this

1080
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:29,170
slide up<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is to do with the</font>

1081
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:32,440
day<font color="#E5E5E5"> to handling and honestly i think</font>

1082
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:34,690
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the area that has had the least</font>

1083
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:37,180
attention and probably has the least

1084
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:38,190
progress and needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be somewhere we're</font>

1085
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:42,339
focusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1086
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:44,410
um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean so I can start by saying hands</font>

1087
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:46,420
up who in this room has read the small

1088
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:48,940
print of the ISP contract and knows

1089
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:52,510
exactly what their isp does with their

1090
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:57,910
DNS data and I'm not one of them say wow

1091
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:59,320
you'll have lies that's great so that's

1092
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:01,529
a thing and we're the kind of people who

1093
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:04,810
should really know and care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1094
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:07,900
so what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here is</font>

1095
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:10,420
looking at more it needs to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done so</font>

1096
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:13,240
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example government policy and</font>

1097
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:15,670
practice in terms of surveillance and

1098
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,649
data sharing particularly like some

1099
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:23,760
recent political events we might all

1100
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:26,800
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be thinking about this headset</font>

1101
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,290
also what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want is much more</font>

1102
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,869
transparency from users and providers

1103
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:34,150
about what are they doing with a data

1104
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:36,540
why is it in small print why isn't it up

1105
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:39,820
front and easy for you to find out

1106
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:42,340
similarly<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if you have to keep data</font>

1107
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:44,440
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can to do identify it</font>

1108
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:46,780
you can still do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot with the data but</font>

1109
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:48,580
but in terms of certainly academic

1110
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,140
exercises where you try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and collect data</font>

1111

day in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> life</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1112
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:56,730
like then least we thought given to<font color="#E5E5E5"> D</font>

identifying that data to protect users a

00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:06,700
very quick note on<font color="#E5E5E5"> um a couple of topics</font>

1115
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:09,130
here um so DNS over HTTPS has actually

1116
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:11,649
been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a while non-standard but</font>

1117
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:13,600
used there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good review of why</font>

1118
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:15,970
it was used and some of the motivations

1119
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:18,339
well one was privacy it brings that with

1120
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:20,350
it others were bypassing middle box

1121
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:22,780
interference others works posing

1122
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:24,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">higher-level api's but this is kind of</font>

1123
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:27,720
gathering a bit of momentum so it's not

1124
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:30,070
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> being positioned as a</font>

00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:33,339
previously solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> first and foremost</font>

1126
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:36,060
it's much more a new technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1127
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:38,590
their address to specify how to do this

<font color="#CCCCCC">Google is actually offering a DNS ever</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there's going to be a boffin Tuesday</font>

1133
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:50,290
night on this topic so if you're

encourage you to go

00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:56,558
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the matrix I showed earlier</font>

1163
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:06,640
the moment the approach of the buying

1164
00:52:04,299 --> 00:52:09,490
folks is not to put tier less directly

1165
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:12,819
into the name server rather what<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1166
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:14,558
and proposing is using a TLS proxy in

1167
00:52:12,819 --> 00:52:15,819
front of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the name server and there are</font>

1168
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:17,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">lots of technical reasons this makes</font>

1170
00:52:17,529 --> 00:52:25,349
available so this is certainly a viable

1171
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:27,849
way to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm on the stub side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1172
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:29,740
most of the energy and effort has been

1173
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:31,510
expended over the last few years towards

1174
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:33,970
get dns and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll talk about that a</font>

1177
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:42,339
from this in terms of deployed and used

1178
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:44,410
at libraries and that's a real challenge

1179
00:52:42,339 --> 00:52:49,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">in terms of getting new features into</font>

1180
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:51,848
those libraries so essentially there's

1181
00:52:49,539 --> 00:52:54,010
uptake of this as implementations of

what has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been being developed over the</font>

1210
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:08,750
last few years is based around get dns

00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:12,080
so if you're not familiar with it get

1212

dns is a modern asynchronous doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

the website what it does do is it

00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:24,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">already implements</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS over TLS and it</font>

1216
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:27,440
is already a natively validating DNS SEC

1217
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:31,040
client stub so it takes two boxes in

1218
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,180
terms of enabling privacy so what has

1219
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,370
recently been developed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

1220
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:37,330
release is a new mode of using get dns

1221
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:39,890
which is called stubby this is the

1222
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:42,069
mascot<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it sergeant stubby i'll let</font>

1223

you google him if you're interested

1224
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:49,400
basically what stubby does is it runs as

1225
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:53,270
a demon on your machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> you point your</font>

do you want to do stricter opportunistic

00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:20,290
this is

1238
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:22,150
all configurable there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> web page on</font>

1239
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:24,190
how to build stubby configure it and use

1240
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:25,930
it and if anybody's interested in

1241
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:28,720
actually getting hands-on with this then

1242

come and<font color="#E5E5E5"> find me or will interrupt or</font>

lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in hackathon this weekend</font>

1256
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:04,930
we're doing a lot of interrupt testing

00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,940
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> study and some of these upstream</font>

1258
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:09,850

1259
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:11,860
and making it<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more usable and a</font>

1263
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:24,400
into os's making them accessible making

00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:25,810
them usable for users and this face is

1265
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,120
very similar challenge today in a sack

1266
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:30,700
in that respect so hopefully we can

1267
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,140
learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> something from that and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1279
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:01,780
in progress and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are tests</font>

1280
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:03,790
implementations out there that you can

1281
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:05,350
use today if you're interested and there

1282
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:09,730
are more privacy services and more

1283
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:12,310
solutions on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way also I think in the</font>

1284
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:15,030
very near future the public awareness of

<font color="#E5E5E5">this is going to continue increasing</font>

1286
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:19,570
after all edward snowed and got

<font color="#E5E5E5">about it and I do have hopes that one</font>

1290
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:29,290
day there might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an IDF the movie to</font>

1291
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,779
recognize all the folks here

1295
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:41,380
and casting suggestions for that movie

will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very gratefully received in the</font>

1297

bar later on so with that I will thank

1298
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:50,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">you for your time I will point you at a</font>

great and thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very much I'd be</font>

1303
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:10,510
happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions Laurens are</font>

1304
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:12,730
clearly not sadly not dns specific so

1305
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:15,670
for as long as s and I exist this is all

1306
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:16,990
in vain right yeah so um<font color="#E5E5E5"> d can he take</font>

1307
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:20,410
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us how you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna fix that</font>

1308
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:22,299
you came in you came<font color="#CCCCCC"> in late um so leaky</font>

1309
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:24,250
boat you missed I hardly probably keep

1310
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:27,250
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah so what was it how do you</font>

1311
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:29,530
fix the elderly um so that's not

1312
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:32,950
something that we can fix in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS um</font>

1313
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:35,050
uh there are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of possibilities I</font>

1314
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:37,180
tried to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get that into TLS 1.3 and I got</font>

1315
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:38,830
pushed<font color="#E5E5E5"> back from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some large server</font>

1316
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:42,419
operators that didn't want to incur an

1317
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:45,730
extra round trip which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is understandable</font>

1318
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:50,410
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be a automatic in</font>

1319
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:53,250
TLS 1.3 at any rate so we have there's a

1320
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:58,810
couple of possibilities that would allow

1321
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:59,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">sni cover traffic basically and I'm not</font>

1322
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:00,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go into that right now because</font>

1323
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:02,230
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other people with</font>

1324
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:03,580
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the DNS but I'm happy to</font>

1325
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:05,440
talk with you afterwards and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone</font>

1326
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:09,009
has other specific ideas about doing it

1327
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:14,410
jealous s and I here also this is not

1328
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:15,840
just for TLS so right generate I just

1329
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:19,270
happened have wandered in off the street

1330
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:20,710
Sarah I wanted to introduce a leonine

1331
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:22,480
question here have you had any

1332
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:25,120
conversations any of the data protection

1333
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">authorities about whether this DNS</font>

1334
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:30,279
create traffic will be considered as

1335
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:32,830
personal data or not not direct ones and

1336
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:35,880
also that's going to vary country by

1337
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:39,160
country I mean that's a huge issue and

1338
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:41,920
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it's for necessarily for us</font>

1339
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,670
protocol folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> deterrent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple I think</font>

1340
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,280
that

1341
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:49,210
is up a level<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an organizational</font>

1342
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:52,050
question what has been remarked as this

1343
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:54,880
it will be quite interesting if these

1344
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:57,160
there's uptake in terms of this test

1345
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,290
servers and it's observed that DNS

1346
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:02,470
traffic is being routinely encrypted and

1347
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:05,950
how certain monitoring authorities might

1348
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:08,080
react to that in terms of exact office

1349
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:09,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">gation of personal data I don't know</font>

1350
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:11,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's an unanswered question I'm just</font>

1351
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:14,440
thinking this memory to help with optic

1352
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:16,180
of these technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> once the big</font>

1353
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:19,210
become more widely accepted and widely

1354
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:21,040
deployed and as also as you're probably

1355
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:22,870
there's a lot of operators particular

1356
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,850
the European Union a very concerned

1357
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:27,370
about data retention<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all those other</font>

1358
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:29,650
considerations so stuff like DNS query

1359
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:31,509
traffic is<font color="#E5E5E5"> already an issue for them so</font>

1360
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:33,310
if there are reasonably that problem can

1361
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:35,140
be can be minimized from their point of

1362
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:37,180
view by using some of these office keys

1363
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:38,680
and technologies that could also have a

1364
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:40,149
good thing but the message they'll have

1365
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:42,100
to be coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things like the data</font>

1366
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:43,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">protection authorities this is we can</font>

1367
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,220
sell this personal data you need to

1368
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:46,390
start taking things much more cease

1369
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:48,549
about how you treat<font color="#E5E5E5"> than handle that</font>

1370
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:50,830
data yeah and I i agree i think that's

1371
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:53,380
that's an area that hasn't received as

1372
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:55,810
much attention as it<font color="#E5E5E5"> should have and</font>

1373
01:00:53,380 --> 01:01:05,020
certainly will need to in future thank
