45
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,730
effort on or not at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of this</font>

54
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:26,659
first up to talk about double and

55
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:30,020

56
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,190
less what the slide is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um double</font>

57
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,599

60
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,660
since the last time is you remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

61
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:56,540
always had in this draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> text</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

62
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:57,650
there's things that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're Indian</font>

63
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,630
encrypted things are hop to hop

64
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,870
encrypted there are certain headers that

65
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,969
may have been inserted by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the media</font>

66
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,470
distributor and your question is is

67
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,480
which ones with us in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end point</font>

68
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,040
trust and we discussed the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting</font>

69
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">that really the only one of those that</font>

70
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,419
we had a use case for and thought was

71
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,520
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> he coming from the in the</font>

72
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:22,120
media distributor down to the end point

73
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:25,340
was the mixer to client audio levels um

74
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,780
job buttocks I don't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

75
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,039
description that seems very<font color="#E5E5E5"> unlikely to</font>

76
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:34,489
me because that<font color="#E5E5E5"> only happens if you're</font>

77
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:37,490
mixing audio with<font color="#CCCCCC"> your not I know it</font>

78
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:39,470
happens if you're switching audio and

79
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,710
sent down<font color="#E5E5E5"> for copies and want the far</font>

80
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:45,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">into oh you'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only have I see her hmm</font>

81
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:47,299
any client to mixer maybe forward it

82
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,849
even though you're forwarding it on but

83
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:59,360
Victor the client is for the next audio

84
00:05:49,850 --> 00:06:03,250
with see<font color="#E5E5E5"> sources right um yeah</font>

85
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">dumbfoundead I don't know what say ah</font>

mixer for cancer which one did I

89
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,180
actually put in the draft could somebody

90
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,960
glass this for us

91
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:30,220
here there is no mixer to mixer but you

92
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,370
use myxer to client for cascade lakes

93
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:36,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">for even for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cascade links I'm sure</font>

94
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">I put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the draft what the minutes</font>

95
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:44,240
mate said I may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have put complete</font>

96
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:46,580
gibberish into this slide on walks into

97
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,780
a prime moment a complete disaster good

98
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:53,030
beginning of the meeting ah somebody can

99
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:58,099
check that uh there was only one thing

100
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:59,570
added to that list yes how the mixer

101
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:01,820
that can't access the media would know

102
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,620
the audio level oh no it copies it from

103
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,449
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other one it gets the client to</font>

104
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,099
audio it gets the sorry he gets the

105
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:10,070
client to mixer it copies it into the

106
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:26,270
mixer then see Ronnie you knew the

107
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:27,320
answer you didn't tell me<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay I</font>

108
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,359
think I looked it up i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

109
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,300
is saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if it could if the</font>

110
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,740
originating<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint you know right</font>

111
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,940
what's a ten-point was itself a mixer

112
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,729
and put it in the header in the first

113
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,349
place think you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

114
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:42,169
think that's all that saying which that

115
00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:43,880
would make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh ish ish sort of my</font>

116
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:46,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">way architect that way but if they</font>

117
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">weren't you or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two it is we do have some</font>

118
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:50,120
systems that are like sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hybrid but</font>

119
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:52,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agree with you is not making a lot of</font>

120
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,259
sense I don't think problem with it

121
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,940
that's the change i may give some

122
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:57,590
thought to that change it may be that

123
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,669
change is complete gibber ish and who

124
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:03,638
knows what we're thinking at the last

125
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:06,979
meeting I fixed more than a few typos

126
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:08,630
and there's basically no other issues or

127
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:10,070
things have been raised since since

128
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,340
really about eight months ago on this

129
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:14,690
one so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one that's</font>

130
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,609
where it is so let's move on to the next

131
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:19,099
one ekt where there's actually a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

132
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,560
changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened so first of all like</font>

133
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:23,090
huge thanks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russ I got probably like</font>

134
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,979
one of the best reviews<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've ever gotten</font>

135
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,989
if any draft it was like I knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> what to</font>

136
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:28,609
do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> them it's very concrete I went</font>

137
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:35,890
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this resulted in a</font>

138
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:35,890
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of changes ah Nick slide here on</font>

139
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,900
so a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things we're fixing</font>

140
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:43,430
fairly small things or<font color="#CCCCCC"> are being able to</font>

141
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,290
deal with issues like how you know which

142
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:49,219
direction you truncate salt information

143
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:52,219
on the big change was moving some

144
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:54,650
implicit sizes too explicit I'll talk

145
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,600
more about that a second just<font color="#E5E5E5"> added some</font>

146
00:08:54,650 --> 00:09:01,310
missing things like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> animas like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Diana</font>

147
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,630
tables um and made it a little bit you

148
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,270
know cleaned up some<font color="#CCCCCC"> text they've been</font>

149
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:09,080
laying around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a very long time but</font>

150
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:11,720
needed spring cleaning on really the

151
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:16,400
dtls extension so so got that clean up

152
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,690
the implicit<font color="#CCCCCC"> size to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explicit on let's</font>

153
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:23,930
go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next slide which is basically</font>

154
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:28,070
the open issue on right in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the</font>

155
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:31,520
older dress uh we we didn't have an

156
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:37,310
explicit length header for how long<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

157
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:41,319
encrypted how long the plaintext was

158
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:44,209
effectively<font color="#E5E5E5"> that became encrypted and</font>

159
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,830
how you figured that out was by looking

160
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:48,290
at around at a few different things to

161
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:50,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">know which cipher you were using know</font>

162
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,550
which the srtp master key length would

163
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,530
have been and then you could compute

164
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,870
what this size of this block was and you

165
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,400
could figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how many bytes off the</font>

166
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,440
header you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know reading backwards from</font>

167
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,439
the front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the package how large a</font>

168
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,320
field to take on that's cause a lot of

169
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,880
confusion for four people along the ways

170
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,260
including<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> russ read this he's like</font>

171
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work you don't have all the</font>

172
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">information you need it would be</font>

173
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,680
somewhat complicated to get so what I

174
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,990
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> to address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Russ</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is comment on</font>

175
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,609
that there and for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were thinking</font>

176
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:25,040
you earlier for one of the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> reviews</font>

177
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:26,570
ever don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee so what we do this is</font>

178
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">just like you know added a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one-bite</font>

179
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,650
length header<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto this field it makes</font>

180
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,000
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> very clear and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple on how this</font>

181
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,290
stuff goes I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> some people are</font>

182
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">concerned say like look we don't need</font>

183
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,670
that would prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not add this bite</font>

184
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,040
that there's another way to implicitly

185
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,380
figure this out my feeling is that this

186
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,420
bite only gets added to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> EK teeth</font>

187
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,220
long message which only goes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font>

188
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,349
our RTP packets rights when we put in

189
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,640
periodically and it expands it slightly

190
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,460
and

191
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,110
it just reduces the number of ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

192
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,700
can cause a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of confusion probably</font>

193
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,680
makes this much easier to extend later

194
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:01,250
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that this is just a really</font>

195
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,870
simplifying change at a very low cost so

196
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this was the</font>

197
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,170
biggest open issue to me is whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

198
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,880
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep this one or not does anyone</font>

199
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:25,699
read this or have strong opinions about

200
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:36,560
this bits and pieces of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Tobias</font>

201
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:39,320
life bro it's like totally lots I this

202
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,609
certainly addresses the issue this is

203
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,650
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue you raised of not being</font>

204
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,910
able to commute the size i added an

205
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,800
explicit size it<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes it really easy</font>

206
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,959
after that point we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could probably do it</font>

207
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:56,900
without<font color="#CCCCCC"> size of my preferences</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to that</font>

208
00:11:47,960 --> 00:12:04,610
so if everyone yeah yeah through through

209
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:06,920
several yeah um and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pretty much</font>

210
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:09,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">it on open issues of this so next slide</font>

211
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:13,839
on this one so my feeling of where we

212
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:16,250
are on this one is it's ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

213
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,830
first working group last call I mean

214
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,210
there's really not many issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

215
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:23,000
there's no known issues open with it

216
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:26,450
right now um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> if people go</font>

217
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,800
through and read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it carefully will maybe</font>

218
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">people will decide no no no there's some</font>

219
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,920
really big issues here calling your nuts

220
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,970
many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> inside are there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

221
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,569
small things we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change more</font>

222
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:40,940
pretty close but oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah well let's</font>

223
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:46,150
stick with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nuts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off yeah need a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hug</font>

224
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:46,150
figure that one out I blame the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF</font>

225
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,540
important information<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give non calm</font>

226
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:03,560
so um you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know any</font>

227
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,060
other things people want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

228
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,410
with the with these two decks but I mean

229
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,630
we're at a fairly low energy point I

230
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,010
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're going to get a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

231
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:12,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the right step to</font>

232
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,819
get to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next level of review figure</font>

233
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:15,650
out what's done and move this stuff on

234
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so we've got some time at the end</font>

235
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,160
result talk about working group last

236
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:22,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">calls on these two and a couple others</font>

237
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:26,569
so I'll defer that to the end Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You</font>

238
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:40,880
Cohen next up is Adam yes Adam worked on

239
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:42,740
them it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> adam in the room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay hi i'm</font>

240
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,900
i'm paul jones i'm here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

241
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:50,120
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> towel wrap actually do we have is</font>

242
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:53,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">paul remote kinda he wants to a song</font>

243
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay good he wants to be available for</font>

244
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,420
this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i might have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lean on him a</font>

245
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:59,960
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the final slide let's go</font>

246
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,660
and get started so there were a few

247
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">small changes in tunnel this time around</font>

248
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:06,020
and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all based on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

249
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:09,110
discussions that we had at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last ITF</font>

250
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:14,600
where we switched the tunnel transport

251
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:17,110
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls back pls we changed the key</font>

252
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:21,770
field names so that they're the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

253
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:23,690
5764 it's you know cosmetic we

254
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:25,010
introduced a conference identifier field

255
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,270
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's actually thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i am</font>

256
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:29,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably going to lean a little bit on</font>

257
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:33,319
Paul to help describe the rationale and

258
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,790
then we switched back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we had in</font>

259
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,890
the first version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wrap which was</font>

260
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,920
a TLS style syntax for describing these

261
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:42,290
as opposed to sort of the traditional

262
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">pluses and lines with fixed fields just</font>

263
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,050
because this is a lot easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

264
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:51,140
with a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier to read a lot easier</font>

265
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:53,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">to write next so we probably it probably</font>

266
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">is not really a good use of our time to</font>

267
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,110
step through these other than to point

268
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,360
out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also have in the process of</font>

269
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,800
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> added some additional message types</font>

270
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,340
i think we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> three before and now we</font>

271
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,439
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> five we added specifically a error</font>

272
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,600
message for indicating that the

273
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,370
versions that are on both<font color="#E5E5E5"> sides this</font>

274
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,050
connection don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> match and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need</font>

275
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do something to recover now we</font>

276
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,680
probably do want to engage into some

277
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,920
conversation about exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

278
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,150
recovery procedures look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

279
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,860
it's a little bit weird to figure out

280
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,510
you know once you disconnect and

281
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,040
reconnect or what have you exactly how

282
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">you indicate now I need to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

283
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,420
different than the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last time so we</font>

284
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:32,930
succeed and we also have an endpoint

285
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:35,060
disconnect message that the mixer uses

286
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:37,489
well the media distributor uses to tell

287
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:41,569
the key distributor<font color="#CCCCCC"> that someone has</font>

288
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:43,520
left you need to rekey things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

289
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,630
said we probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> can more or less skip</font>

290
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,720
through these unless someone wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

291
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:51,470
dig into specific details about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

292
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,610
profile keys or tunnel messages if you

293
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:59,660
have things you want to discuss we have

294
00:15:52,610 --> 00:16:01,640
plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay super important</font>

295
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:05,839
so what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the iono registry rules for</font>

296
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:15,319
the message type<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're in there I try</font>

297
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:17,090
to know exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they are is I mean</font>

298
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:23,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">desean do you think we engage in the</font>

299
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:24,620
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> around this or okay are all</font>

300
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,300
right so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can probably just</font>

301
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,160
scroll through very quickly the next

302
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,439
four or five slides that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of show oh</font>

303
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,900
wait actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and this is somewhat</font>

304
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,370
illustrative it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new diagram</font>

305
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:37,340
of the document the basis<font color="#E5E5E5"> points</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out we</font>

306
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:39,170
set up a TLS connection and then the

307
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,540
media tribute is going to say here the

308
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:45,469
profiles<font color="#E5E5E5"> of support you can use as part</font>

309
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:48,349
of the dtls establishment with<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoints</font>

310
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,820
as they join the dtls<font color="#CCCCCC"> the handshakes</font>

311
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,350
with all of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> clients proceed as</font>

312
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,670
normal they are encapsulated in these

313
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,589
tunnel messages between the media

314
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:58,579
distributor and the key distributor with

315
00:16:54,589 --> 00:17:00,230
a couple of indications one is who is

316
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,020
this like which of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> associations that</font>

317
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,910
we've established is this and which

318
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:08,780
conferences correspond to that's the

319
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:13,089
conference ID that we've added um so if

320
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:15,920
this has any questions if not keep going

321
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:18,139
syntax we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> skip this</font>

322
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,310
let's get this like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said we can we can</font>

323
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,470
stop and go back to these<font color="#E5E5E5"> of anyone that</font>

324
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,000
shouldn't talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in particular but I</font>

325
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,530
guess the one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to note here is all</font>

326
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,210
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these have these conference IDs in</font>

327
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:32,750
them skip this and yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

328
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:35,960
useful either and that's even less usual

329
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:38,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so the the one big thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

330
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,670
probably do want to to highlight here is

331
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:44,060
that when we were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work through</font>

332
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:48,680
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information flow about how</font>

333
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:50,240
you indicate to a kmf what conference

334
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,580
someone should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in like which keys</font>

335
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,900
they need to have access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

336
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:57,610
kind of missing from the previous

337
00:17:53,900 --> 00:18:02,360
protocols so what we've added here is an

338
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:03,590
explicit indication of the conference ID

339
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,120
now we probably need to talk about

340
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,280
exactly who generate these who's in

341
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,800
charge of them the way it's laid out in

342
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,810
the spec right now it's as as people

343
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,669
join the key distributor basically tells

344
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:19,010
the media distributor<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh that person</font>

345
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:20,210
goes in this conference but I think

346
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,620
until<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually work through what the</font>

347
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:25,130
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> flows are with things like</font>

348
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:26,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">sip and web RTC it might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not be obvious</font>

349
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,790
whether that's exactly the right

350
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:30,679
direction for things to go at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point</font>

351
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,690
I'm actually going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask Paul to put</font>

352
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,150
himself in line to see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> he can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> explain</font>

353
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:37,430
this final slide 11 issue while he's

354
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:40,940
doing that can we skip back a slide the

355
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:42,590
unsupported version sure um how<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

356
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,610
recipient of this supposed to know what

357
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:48,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">version he should support the said the</font>

358
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">top-level message that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a sub</font>

359
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:52,820
message<font color="#CCCCCC"> out contains a version field</font>

360
00:18:49,970 --> 00:19:00,280
that states what version you do support

361
00:18:52,820 --> 00:19:00,280
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay is is Paul here</font>

362
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:21,910
calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paul Jones Oh give us some</font>

363
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:24,640
indication so is he unable to put

364
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:28,840
himself in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the speaker q all if you can</font>

365
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:34,900
hear us knock twice oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright well</font>

366
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:39,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a good proxy you probably go</font>

367
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:47,159
ahead let him go we have you press the

368
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:55,889
button in any<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of-- yeah hello hello</font>

369
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:58,299
so on behalf of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Paul Jones so the the</font>

370
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:00,610
different alternatives we have here for

371
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:06,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">the conference ID basically comes down</font>

372
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:08,080
to the question of<font color="#CCCCCC"> how and who needs to</font>

373
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:11,890
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the knowledge about the conference</font>

374
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,168
ID option number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

375
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:16,120
when we set up a conference on the media

376
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:19,720
distributor we tell the media

377
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:24,010
distributor this is conference x these

378
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:26,830
are the participants and then the media

379
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:29,169
distributor with his first tunneled<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS</font>

380
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,600
message towards the kmf can basically

381
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:34,179
transfer that knowledge over to the key

382
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,049
management function that's option number

383
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:41,559
one option number two on the table is

384
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:43,330
basically the the signaling does not

385
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:45,850
tell the media distributor anything

386
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:48,520
about the conference ID it just tells it

387
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:50,559
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create a new conference</font>

388
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:55,418
and this participant goes into that

389
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:58,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">conference arm and go go talk to this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> K</font>

390
00:20:55,419 --> 00:21:01,120
MFPs for this participant and then once

391
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:03,190
the the kmf has basically given access

392
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,350
to the participant once it sends the

393
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:08,770
media keys back to the to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the media</font>

394
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:10,780
distributor<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kmf basically says like</font>

395
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,908
here's the conference ID for this

396
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,950
participant and that way the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> media</font>

397
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:18,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">distributor learns which</font>

398
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:21,280
conference IDs which participant has

399
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:25,030
which conference ID and therefore to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

400
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,300
whom to forward the<font color="#E5E5E5"> media and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

401
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:30,399
option on the table actually to go one

402
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:34,000
slide back the one of the problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

403
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">the with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> approach of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the second</font>

404
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,770
approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if a participant wants to</font>

405
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:42,970
join two conference calls at the same

406
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:46,300
time and the media distributor just

407
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:50,530
forwards the the dtls packets to the kmf

408
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:52,060
the only way for that for the key

409
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:54,520
distributor to distinguish different

410
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:57,940
participants is basically by the

411
00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:02,590
fingerprint of their certificate so if

412
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:04,600
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the requirement that if a client</font>

413
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:06,490
wants to join<font color="#CCCCCC"> two conference at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

414
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,459
time he has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use two different</font>

415
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:11,350
certificates then it is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer a</font>

416
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,410
problem for the kmf to distinguish these

417
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:16,899
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> different conferences for the same</font>

418
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:19,360
participant so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we make that</font>

419
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,370
requirement then potentially we could

420
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,860
even eliminate the whole conference ID

421
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:26,560
field as part of the tunneling message

422
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:28,510
because then the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> signaling could</font>

423
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,270
basically go and say to the media

424
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:34,870
distributor here's a conference x these

425
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:36,520
are the participants obviously for the

426
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">signaling itself we could set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up some</font>

427
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,780
conference ID but it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

428
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:43,480
matter and then you do the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

429
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kmf you also signal it like</font>

430
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,950
here's the conference these are the

431
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:50,560
participants<font color="#CCCCCC"> on now the the km f and the</font>

432
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:52,780
media distributor don't need to talk

433
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">about which conference this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

434
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,760
because they only need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know to</font>

435
00:22:55,060 --> 00:23:00,820
forward which<font color="#CCCCCC"> details packets and for</font>

436
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,129
the for the media distributor he cannot

437
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,139
forward packets to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual</font>

438
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:07,570
participants and unless he has<font color="#E5E5E5"> received</font>

439
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:09,640
the media keys for the participant so

440
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:12,780
that's like kind of the I don't know

441
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:16,330
stateless option basically we're like

442
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:17,920
the the video distributor and the key

443
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:20,530
management function both have a

444
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,960
knowledge about who goes into which

445
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:24,899
conference but they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as part of</font>

446
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,180
the protocol they don't exchange that

447
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,909
these are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> three options i'm i guess</font>

448
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,679
like this

449
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:34,789
probably confusing no matter how I put

450
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:38,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">it but I think you did a better job than</font>

451
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:41,239
I would have so does<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone have any</font>

452
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:51,889
opinions input about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best way to</font>

453
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:55,789
coordinate these things so the only one

454
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:59,238
it's the first if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I recall correctly was</font>

455
00:23:55,789 --> 00:24:00,950
communication of the ID basically it's

456
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:03,049
it's you either communicated from the

457
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:06,759
media tribute to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cape k-map became</font>

458
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:10,519
my work<font color="#E5E5E5"> or they define it independently</font>

459
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:13,639
sorry chan one is the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> media</font>

460
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:15,799
distributor signals it to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kmf option</font>

461
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:17,359
two is the other way around the kmf

462
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:19,369
forwards it to the to the media

463
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:21,439
distributor and the third one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

464
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:25,939
no conference ID as part of the protocol

465
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:29,840
at all the the underlying problem or

466
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:31,309
requirement here though is that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we if</font>

467
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,689
we don't want to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a requirement</font>

468
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:37,099
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a client needs to use two distinct</font>

469
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:41,929
certificates to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to join to</font>

470
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:44,418
conference at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same time then the the</font>

471
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:46,669
option with no conference ID on the

472
00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:48,559
table wouldn't work and the second

473
00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:52,039
option where the kmf tells that the mvd

474
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:55,399
would also not work because the client

475
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:58,279
would come twice to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mvd both was the</font>

476
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:59,899
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> DTS fingerprint because he only</font>

477
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:02,029
uses one certificate in that case

478
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:05,599
basically the only option<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that the</font>

479
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:07,609
MDD needs to signal towards the<font color="#E5E5E5"> km f</font>

480
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,399
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> duty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> LS connection is for</font>

481
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:13,309
conference a and this tunnel<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS</font>

482
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:14,779
message is for conference be so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess</font>

483
00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:16,340
that's the the main question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is whether</font>

484
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want to make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a requirement that</font>

485
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,908
that a client<font color="#E5E5E5"> who wants to participate</font>

486
00:25:17,869 --> 00:25:21,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">in two conference at the same time that</font>

487
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:23,419
he needs to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use to distinguish</font>

488
00:25:21,139 --> 00:25:25,508
certificates or whether we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave</font>

489
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:29,929
it open to to reuse an existing

490
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:33,499
certificate multiple times and just

491
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:35,210
personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we should make it a</font>

492
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:36,889
requirement to use distinct certificates

493
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,570
and then go with option number three

494
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:41,719
don't have a conference ID at all as

495
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,530
part of the signaling protocol but we're

496
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,620
like open for

497
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:46,910
discussion on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that whole topic you just</font>

498
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,679
let you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room there were a</font>

499
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:50,690
couple of rather vigorous<font color="#CCCCCC"> head-shakes</font>

500
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:55,580
know on that proposition but I'm certain

501
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:58,820
they'll talk to it in more detail<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

502
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:00,230
Cullen<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jing's I it seems to me that when</font>

503
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,460
we when we fit this into the broader

504
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,600
architecture that you're gonna have in a

505
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,850
conferencing system where there might be

506
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,500
like a media resource manager that's

507
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,939
setting up multiple conference bridges

508
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,400
and selecting which one you use it and

509
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,840
linking all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this end that different</font>

510
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,520
architectures are going to set this up

511
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,590
different ways and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will pretty likely to</font>

512
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,200
have some people who might want the

513
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:19,699
conference ID flowing one way and

514
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,730
another group<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might want flowing</font>

515
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,980
the other way I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the question</font>

516
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:26,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">of who could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually be given the</font>

517
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,680
really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people who can really</font>

518
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,060
authenticate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint is probably</font>

519
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:33,230
the kmf because of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only people that</font>

520
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:36,250
terminate<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS connection I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

521
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:38,870
leaves me a little bit like wow that

522
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:42,260
whoever no matter which direction this

523
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:45,080
flows from the md zoo the<font color="#E5E5E5"> KD or from the</font>

524
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:47,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">KD to the md the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> katy has to verify that</font>

525
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,350
it's correct and reject the connection

526
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:50,180
if it's not correct like that's the

527
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,709
important part to me so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i sort of want</font>

528
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,790
to provide end up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> different people</font>

529
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,930
want to do this different ways and we're

530
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:56,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to support</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> blowing both</font>

531
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:57,530
both directions or or not it or not used

532
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,600
at all like I guess what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying is</font>

533
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:01,870
there's a force option of do all three

534
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,399
of the above and don't worry about it I

535
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:06,290
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would likely make this work</font>

536
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,740
take significantly longer than it

537
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:12,830
already is yes I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that make it like</font>

538
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:14,180
comedy gris would be so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it</font>

539
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:16,010
would make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it very complicated in terms</font>

540
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:19,670
to express all the different options on

541
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:24,200
the table for an implementer regarding

542
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:26,230
the the concern whether you whether you

543
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,960
let someone into a conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not I</font>

544
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:33,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">think for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the option number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

545
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:36,620
basically we could leverage basically

546
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:38,659
the media keys as the the token of

547
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,129
authentication from the kmf basically if

548
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:43,160
the video distributor sits there and

549
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:45,110
like forward like some tunnel<font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls to</font>

550
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,330
the kmf and the kmf never sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> him back</font>

551
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:49,250
like media keys for this participant the

552
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:52,159
media distributor can't do anything with

553
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,840
the purpose it in any way<font color="#CCCCCC"> he like he</font>

554
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:57,640
will receive traffic from it but he like

555
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,639
he can't like decrypted so

556
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:04,580
wrong even<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is also</font>

557
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,770
the case where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> km f is in one of the</font>

558
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,330
workstations or one of the endpoints in

559
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:10,730
which case he will provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

560
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,500
conference ID so because he<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also</font>

561
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,960
creating the conference and he knows the

562
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:18,500
participants so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes sense</font>

563
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,090
of the conference ID coming from the key

564
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,650
management function but also like you

565
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:23,240
said I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can come from the media</font>

566
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:25,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">distribution depends who create the</font>

567
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,860
conference I mean in the first place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

568
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the information well the layer which</font>

569
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:34,459
knows who's worth the participant who is

570
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:38,300
allowed to the conference<font color="#CCCCCC"> Richard burns</font>

571
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:40,970
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the form</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I mean I am sort of</font>

572
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:44,030
inclined as usual to not do work here um

573
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:46,580
like I am highly in agreement with Colin

574
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:47,870
I think when you take sit down and try

575
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:50,389
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrate this thing into a real</font>

576
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:51,530
conferencing system or a suite of real

577
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:53,990
conferencing systems you're going to

578
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:56,270
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different answers to this how do we</font>

579
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:58,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">assign associations to conferences in</font>

580
00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:03,440
different scenarios but I'm not sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

581
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:06,020
need to burden this protocol with all of

582
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,120
that complexity I think as long as these

583
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:11,990
two participants of the two participants

584
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:14,149
in this protocol that<font color="#CCCCCC"> kmfdm d can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> v can</font>

585
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:15,440
state clearly what conference they

586
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:17,090
believe what conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

587
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,060
association they believe this packets

588
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:21,679
belong to they can arrange those

589
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,889
conferences and associations however

590
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:26,330
they like at the signaling layer and

591
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:27,530
this protocol can just do do its thing

592
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:31,040
and they can pass things back and forth

593
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:32,840
as long as it says how it provides an

594
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,510
anchor for the signaling to talk about

595
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:38,000
so my inclination here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to have</font>

596
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:40,450
everything identified as conference and

597
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">association probably in both directions</font>

598
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:49,280
and not really do anything beyond that I

599
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:50,419
don't think that entails a<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess you</font>

600
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,160
have a conference I'd be there anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

601
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,540
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would entail the the</font>

602
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,970
requirement that Nils stated about

603
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:58,580
having different certificates and I

604
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:59,690
think if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrive in a state where we</font>

605
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there's a requirement they have</font>

606
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,910
different certificates we should

607
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,440
engineer<font color="#CCCCCC"> our way out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that state</font>

608
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:05,980
because that it's not really a tenable

609
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,980
requirement

610
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:20,620
what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> came down here to save them said</font>

611
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:21,700
oh so no no what I ki sorry no the bit

612
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:25,689
that I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to preserve was that</font>

613
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:27,700
because because even if the md might the

614
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,500
segment<font color="#E5E5E5"> base going to be broken</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MD</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

615
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,490
broken right if the MD decides is going

616
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,140
to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> the media to the wrong place</font>

617
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:33,549
then your conference is broken anyway

618
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:41,289
but there's no security problem here

619
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:43,510
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key won't be there ok ok so</font>

620
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:45,490
i think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had an argument against you</font>

621
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:48,179
against option<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 of using certificates</font>

622
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:52,480
and against every option under the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sun</font>

623
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:54,610
and I think the direction Ronnie

624
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,549
proposed actually makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most sense</font>

625
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:58,840
to me I mean I I tried to pick one right

626
00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:04,510
now I would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> like let's have a</font>

627
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:06,070
conference ID from KD to md and and if

628
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:07,299
somebody comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with a use case where</font>

629
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,100
they say we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't solve it with just</font>

630
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:11,679
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go do it but it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just all</font>

631
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:16,770
falls back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work this is a signaling</font>

632
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,770
issue not a all we needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> farger</font>

633
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:23,500
that sounds approximately correct to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

634
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:25,780
so one of the things that's been on my

635
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:28,659
plate and pushed under a different pile

636
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:30,549
of work is putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> together something to</font>

637
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:32,380
talk about signaling for web RTC<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

638
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:33,760
trying to discourage anyone else in

639
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:36,039
doing that account as cycles please grab

640
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,049
it and run but I think that once we

641
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:39,490
start that exercise it'll be a little

642
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:42,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit clearer how all this needs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font>

643
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:45,120
anyway so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going with grow any</font>

644
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,200
suggestion for now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you know</font>

645
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,139
figuring out whether that doesn't work

646
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,730
once we get the signaling a little more

647
00:31:50,140 --> 00:32:00,250
specified is probably the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best way to</font>

648
00:31:51,730 --> 00:32:03,210
move forward with it sorry not right now

649
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,210
yeah

650
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:12,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">now right now sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this is</font>

651
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,700
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the documents we've been talking</font>

652
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:17,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">about for a while</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have not</font>

653
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,590
formally adopted as a working group um

654
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:22,970
and I think that was largely because we

655
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:26,870
there was some thrash in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

656
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:28,880
using btls TLS I think judging by some

657
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:30,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">their reactions and we've gotten here I</font>

658
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,750
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've kind of stabilized and TLS</font>

659
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:39,260
of course occurs not here to disassemble

660
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:43,610
it this time that was me so could<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

661
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:45,379
have a quick hum to see if we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

662
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:49,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">adopt this document as working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

663
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:54,380
document if you are in favor of adopting

664
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:56,570
this document please some now if you're

665
00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:00,110
opposed to adopting this document please

666
00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:02,899
on now<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we'll take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this against</font>

667
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:07,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">the milestone that we added</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> against in</font>

668
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:10,780
the interest slides so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> christian</font>

669
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,780
gross please talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the favor</font>

670
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:24,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'm presenting this on behalf of</font>

671
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">David and for who I can't be here at the</font>

672
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:31,730
meeting so they've asked me to present

673
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:34,820
these slides for them so next slide so

674
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:38,690
there weren't a lot of changes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

675
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:39,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">latest version as it mentioned there</font>

676
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:41,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're mainly to do with the</font>

677
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:45,890
administrative things there's a to-do

678
00:33:41,539 --> 00:33:47,809
list that needed to be addressed and as

679
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:50,059
mentioned there that's being moved to

680
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:51,529
github but that's a bit of a misnomer

681
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:53,178
because there's actually nothing in

682
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,679
github except I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Helen put</font>

683
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:59,270
something in<font color="#E5E5E5"> about four hours ago or</font>

684
00:33:54,679 --> 00:34:01,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">side it yeah exactly so yeah that link</font>

685
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:04,668
takes you to that that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even on</font>

686
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:06,230
this draft so bicycle<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are all</font>

687
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:09,710
closed off<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they'll be discussed in</font>

688
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:11,810
later slides the Security section that

689
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,609
was emptying the last version and to

690
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:15,980
solve that problem would change the

691
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:18,699
title to up text from<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks on perk to</font>

692
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:24,889
security considerations<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't address</font>

693
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:26,509
next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

694
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:30,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting there was some discussions about</font>

695
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:33,889
the different types configurations that

696
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:36,668
the media distributor could act in this

697
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:39,139
Benson text added that it's only are

698
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:42,049
acting as a selective forwarding middle

699
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:47,810
box with the constraints of the actual

700
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:50,510
lab draft contains so that was closing

701
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:53,299
one of the action items there was also

702
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:56,210
another action item with regards to one

703
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:58,130
mo media injection so I was putting

704
00:34:56,210 --> 00:35:01,339
things like contra announcements<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

705
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:03,080
things in basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was removed</font>

706
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:13,910
that didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to be any interest in</font>

707
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:17,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so next page okay basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

708
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:20,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">is issue with the conference ID but</font>

709
00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:23,690
we've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussed that previously so</font>

710
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:26,240
we basically just point to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> double</font>

711
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:28,730
draft giving those details so that will

712
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,479
be need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be reflected what are we</font>

713
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:33,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussed</font>

714
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:39,140
leading to the trust section we

715
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:42,310
basically point the WebRTC draft and the

716
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:44,930
list of headed RTP header extensions

717
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:48,920
we've pointed to the double graph for

718
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:51,080
that I asked Alan mentioned earlier so I

719
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:56,480
think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes life you see yep</font>

720
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:59,900
yes sir that's it so extra question

721
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,270
before you sit down um one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

722
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:05,119
slides I ever not quite passive document

723
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:08,450
one of your slides said it refers over

724
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:11,750
to the tunnel draft for details in terms

725
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:13,939
of conveying conference IDs do you

726
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:17,660
happen to remember if that is consistent

727
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:19,210
with what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just discussed I think it</font>

728
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,609
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> points to the document and says</font>

729
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:25,010
conference IDC so there's only one line

730
00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:27,490
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay as I said it was not me he says</font>

731
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:29,990
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave any real details now but</font>

732
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:34,750
whatever it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll have to align it</font>

733
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:34,750
and comes out in the tunnel drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

734
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:43,070
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right oh I'm going back up thing yes</font>

735
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:48,010
next not yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right speeding meeting</font>

736
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:51,440
folks yeah practical um<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

737
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:54,680
what now why don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go back up to the</font>

738
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,920
milestone slide so milestones we have

739
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:02,480
them and now we have adopted documents

740
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:06,140
against three and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty mature</font>

741
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:09,109
ones for the most part so the question

742
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:11,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">is how much more work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do we want to do</font>

743
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:13,700
at this point we've got our media layer

744
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:16,130
kind of stable the key management layer

745
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:18,020
kind of stable and the next thing to

746
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:19,850
launch into<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be the signaling layer</font>

747
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:21,710
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide how we arrange such a</font>

748
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:24,470
conference in these various environments

749
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:27,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">and sip contexts in with RTC context and</font>

750
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:29,480
context um and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this point I just</font>

751
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:33,109
kind of wanted to since where you have

752
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,520
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the media layer approaching</font>

753
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:36,770
completion I wanted to stop and<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a</font>

754
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what our energy is what our</font>

755
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:42,380
implementer interest is and see whether

756
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:43,430
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to now proceed to launch into</font>

757
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">the signaling work</font>

758
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:47,029
or whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to try and close out</font>

759
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:49,579
these media Larry documents and then

760
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:50,930
come back to let people experiment with

761
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:54,020
how they can put that together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

762
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:56,750
back to the signaling questions later so

763
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:59,630
I think ya could i solicit any feedback

764
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:01,819
from implementers but um folks in the

765
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:04,609
group about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we are interested in</font>

766
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:06,259
doing at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point for a full</font>

767
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:07,910
perspective the missus Ida's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adam</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Roche</font>

768
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,190
and this is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of echoing what I said</font>

769
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:12,230
earlier I think that once we start

770
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:14,480
writing down how the information needs

771
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:16,430
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get among nodes with the signaling we</font>

772
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,140
may learn some things about what we've

773
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:19,848
done here that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that more difficult</font>

774
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:22,250
than necessary so it would be very

775
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:24,349
hesitant<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put this front of the iesg</font>

776
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:26,270
and then have to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> away that didn't</font>

777
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:28,190
work we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to add a feel to remove a</font>

778
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:30,319
field to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> something around so i</font>

779
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:32,599
think we probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean these are in</font>

780
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:33,740
pretty good shape go ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we're</font>

781
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:34,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to stop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working on these for now</font>

782
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,640
they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna sort of sit there</font>

783
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:39,470
until we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good shape for the</font>

784
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,569
signaling we don't have to be done but

785
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:42,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know just good data flows a notion</font>

786
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:45,050
of how these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things get from one place</font>

787
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,849
to another and then we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead and</font>

788
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:48,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">start calling these finish once we're</font>

789
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:50,299
comfortable they're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> satisfy the</font>

790
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:52,970
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the signaling that's what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

791
00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:55,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">would recommend so Adam while you're at</font>

792
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:58,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mic could I ask you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to briefly put</font>

793
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,710
on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement your head and speak</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

794
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:06,319
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of interest but you know what</font>

795
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:08,299
your plans are this point yeah so I mean

796
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:09,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we had we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had a co-op come in and</font>

797
00:39:08,299 --> 00:39:11,990
work on like putting a cam out in

798
00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:13,730
Firefox this summer we didn't finish

799
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:16,368
that but we got you know some work done

800
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:17,930
in that space<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's been planning</font>

801
00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:22,430
out to figure out exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to get</font>

802
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:23,509
the other parts in place there are some

803
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:26,270
decisions we're going to have to make

804
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:27,349
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like ekt where I know that</font>

805
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:28,339
there are differing opinions about

806
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:29,900
whether that should be an

807
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:31,880
application-level thing or something

808
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,190
that actually goes inside TLS we're

809
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to want to nail down but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

810
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:39,200
definitely it's there's interest we

811
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:41,089
don't have people<font color="#E5E5E5"> assigned to it and</font>

812
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,529
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> both try to keep pushing it</font>

813
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:47,029
forward as we can I don't know if that's

814
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:48,890
the answer you want that's from a client

815
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:50,510
perspective what I would love is if

816
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:52,339
there were you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a similarly nascent</font>

817
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:54,079
effort somewhere to have some sort of an

818
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:55,460
MD because there's no way<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we're</font>

819
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have resources inside Mozilla</font>

820
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,910
to build that

821
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:02,730
hi I'm Shawn Turner I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

822
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,829
implementer so take it for what that's

823
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:06,299
worth I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should just drive</font>

824
00:40:04,829 --> 00:40:08,309
forth and try to get this stuff done so

825
00:40:06,299 --> 00:40:10,170
i'll take the opposite<font color="#E5E5E5"> of approach from</font>

826
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:11,880
what I am suggested is that it seems

827
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:13,200
like an art we start and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we kind of do</font>

828
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">some things with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sit for a while</font>

829
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">write a bunch another other documents</font>

830
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,660
and they all kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like change</font>

831
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:20,549
everything and we never get done so my

832
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,078
theory is just drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> forth if you think</font>

833
00:40:20,549 --> 00:40:23,940
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> right that's great get it done</font>

834
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,440
if you do the next thing ago we did it

835
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,720
you can update the few things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

836
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,760
did in the other spec and just move on

837
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:38,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">and get done let's let's strive for</font>

838
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:41,940
completion come on<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I mean I don't care</font>

839
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:44,190
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything blocks in RFC editor</font>

840
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:47,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">queue or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blocks sitting on the a DS desk</font>

841
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:56,490
or whatever on on just whatever but I I

842
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:59,069
really want it off my desk and no no I

843
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:00,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">just I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean like I want like right now</font>

844
00:40:59,069 --> 00:41:02,609
we've got all this stuff sort of in our

845
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:04,740
head or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain portion of it and I'd</font>

846
00:41:02,609 --> 00:41:06,240
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get it out I don't want to</font>

847
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,890
spread ourselves so thin across so many

848
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,750
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I'd rather finish one</font>

849
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:11,670
thing move on to the next even if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

850
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:14,040
puts<font color="#E5E5E5"> us at high risk of needing to go</font>

851
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:16,140
back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> redo something and I'm willing</font>

852
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:20,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">to leave the things we think are done</font>

853
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:21,808
sitting on a shelf um waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to confirm</font>

854
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:23,520
that they actually worked like we hope

855
00:41:21,809 --> 00:41:26,010
we were because Adams right we're gonna

856
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,759
find stuff to like it and I'm not our I

857
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:33,299
don't disagree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> your overall view</font>

858
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:36,059
yeah but I don't I don't I don't want to

859
00:41:33,299 --> 00:41:38,520
be I don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have just everything</font>

860
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:40,920
open I want to take a bunch of pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

861
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,020
this tent and pin them down hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

862
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,460
unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's proven that we need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> move</font>

863
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:46,530
those pins just<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave them pinned down</font>

864
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:49,670
as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can so we can we move move</font>

865
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:51,660
on face<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I think that's what I proposed</font>

866
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:53,369
we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some sort of disagreement</font>

867
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:56,490
about exactly what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> means in terms</font>

868
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:58,859
of like I ATF document state it's aight

869
00:41:56,490 --> 00:42:01,078
i mean are you proposing we send this

870
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:03,299
off the iesg and then just like yank it

871
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:04,799
back we decide it's wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because i</font>

872
00:42:03,299 --> 00:42:05,670
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the worst thing that would</font>

873
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:07,410
happen here is like we have something

874
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:10,640
others in RFC and decide oh we have to

875
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:10,640
do abyss four months<font color="#CCCCCC"> later</font>

876
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:19,680
we're gonna run to this five digit

877
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:22,019
problem pretty soon I i don't i'm not

878
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,029
exactly sure where where I proposing

879
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:25,950
that they they said what I'm proposing

880
00:42:24,029 --> 00:42:27,119
is there not an open work item that the

881
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:29,430
working groups dealing with and that

882
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,380
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know sitting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

883
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,940
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chair is waiting to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do a pub</font>

884
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,410
request on them I'm perfectly fine if

885
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,260
they sit there something else but I will

886
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:39,240
say that the web RTC chairs have been

887
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:41,130
sending everything to sit in the RFC

888
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,348
editor queue and when we find it's wrong

889
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:46,140
which we often do we can't get back

890
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:50,750
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it may not be the best</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> principle</font>

891
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:52,980
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can let this stuff's it anyway I</font>

892
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:54,690
didn't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment on I appreciate</font>

893
00:42:52,980 --> 00:43:00,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">your perspective on this but perk is</font>

894
00:42:54,690 --> 00:43:02,039
nowhere near as large as web RTC<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh let</font>

895
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:05,069
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be clear the chairs don't want</font>

896
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:09,210
this on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our desk either so I'm probably</font>

897
00:43:05,069 --> 00:43:10,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">just gonna go slap it on the eds desk so</font>

898
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:18,720
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ad would like to chime in so I</font>

899
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:22,379
mean so are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you saying if you hit the</font>

900
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,180
pub<font color="#E5E5E5"> right but not really button I I</font>

901
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,890
think at this point we could prob well

902
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,269
once we kind of get these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

903
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:29,069
last call in a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> more rounds of</font>

904
00:43:27,269 --> 00:43:30,979
review<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we've probably say that</font>

905
00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:32,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">at this point in time without a ton of</font>

906
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,680
implementation experience we believe

907
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:36,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">these are pretty good these are at least</font>

908
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,730
a reliable snapshot of what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think is</font>

909
00:43:36,509 --> 00:43:42,420
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for now to solve this problem at</font>

910
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:44,460
this layer um now I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

911
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,809
okay to publish as a PS with the

912
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,670
understanding that might need to be

913
00:43:45,809 --> 00:43:49,680
updated later we could downgrade to

914
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:53,039
experimental if that's your at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rads</font>

915
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:56,519
advice um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this is useful to</font>

916
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:59,190
capture as a snapshot of you know you

917
00:43:56,519 --> 00:44:00,959
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> work got done here um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at which</font>

918
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:10,319
you know as a possible baseline for some

919
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:11,460
future work 0 to 80 coverage let's see

920
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:13,380
if they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> consistent technically I</font>

921
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:17,670
guess

922
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:19,440
I am it really to me comes down to how

923
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:21,450
likely you think it is to need to do

924
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,480
short-term changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously there's</font>

925
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:25,560
uncertainty there I'll take the working

926
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,690
groups assessment of what that

927
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,670
uncertainty is if you think you're going

928
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:30,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have to pull</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the RF</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> theatre</font>

929
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:33,030
too few or you think you're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

930
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,800
to visit visit three months down the

00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:37,770
line that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would probably rather not a</font>

932
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">but if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is what we you</font>

933
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:41,070
know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our best best we can do</font>

934
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,930
right now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's a probably right</font>

935
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:45,030
then I think it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense to go ahead</font>

936
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:47,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">and go forward we can talk about</font>

937
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:49,380
proposed standard versus something else

938
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:55,320
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the final point is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be proposed</font>

939
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:57,990
standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would lean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that way Russ</font>

940
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,730
honestly my view is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want I ETF</font>

941
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:03,029
last call on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other side of wherever</font>

942
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:05,310
you park it right so that you pull it

943
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:07,620
back last call pull it back last call a

944
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:10,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit let's not do that let's park</font>

945
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:16,620
ensembles me where this side of vital

946
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:18,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask not even I didn't hear anyone being</font>

947
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:21,270
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to volunteer to do the signaling</font>

948
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,530
pot so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a choice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on that on</font>

949
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:24,480
the other hand I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be good</font>

950
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:27,420
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> when people read it you awake</font>

951
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,490
in class call they should see at least

952
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,980
if it makes sense in the way they think

953
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:33,899
about how this<font color="#E5E5E5"> all architecture works</font>

954
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,940
and that's published should we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

955
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,620
say when we do the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> last call to ask</font>

956
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,420
the people also to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that also</font>

957
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,740
yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the next step after we</font>

958
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:43,760
finish this conversation is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

959
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:46,620
asked for some reviewers of these things

960
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,930
Alyssa Cooper yeah I'm just agreeing

961
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:51,359
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ross</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i like to think about</font>

962
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:53,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">this in terms of like who in the</font>

963
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:56,940
community has signed up to do what and

964
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:58,850
so like generally speaking the IHG has

965
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:01,140
signed up to review your document once

966
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:02,310
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't really want to send it back</font>

967
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">to them and kind of the same thing</font>

968
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:05,850
variety of last call like most documents

969
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:07,170
if they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> receive a lot of feedback</font>

970
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,850
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first round they don't get</font>

971
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:10,110
multiple ITF last calls and we shouldn't

972
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:12,120
like bird in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole community with</font>

973
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:15,600
having to review<font color="#E5E5E5"> something twice whereas</font>

974
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:19,170
the working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> normative chairs have</font>

975
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:21,390
signed up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than that and so you</font>

976
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:23,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">know for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you to do to you know declare</font>

977
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:26,730
consensus and ride right pub rock and

978
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:28,230
send it to Ben and and for him to value

979
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:29,700
you ate it and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it sit there if</font>

980
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:30,960
you end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on you back and you have to</font>

981
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:39,600
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that again well that's what you</font>

982
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:41,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">signed up for so yeah and actually that</font>

983
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:44,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">was what I came to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about is that i</font>

984
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:46,230
think on draft by draft basis they're

985
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,100
probably a very different decision she

986
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:49,020
made here i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we can</font>

987
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:51,000
probably feel pretty confident the

988
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:53,280
framework we can probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel pretty</font>

989
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,890
good about double e katie needs more

990
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,570
work in the working group because we

991
00:46:55,890 --> 00:47:05,520
have like i said unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ecker is</font>

992
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:07,950
not here but he<font color="#E5E5E5"> accra thinks we should</font>

993
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,590
take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to working group last call and</font>

994
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:12,149
he thinks is probably right but reserves

995
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:13,680
the right to explode it in working group

996
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:17,010
last call so that's that's the end

997
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,359
outcome with Decker okay so take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font>

998
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:22,050
working group last call while wearing

999
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:24,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">asbestos</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well so just to be clear um for</font>

1000
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:27,050
ekt do you think that that is something

1001
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:29,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is likely to change as a result of</font>

1002
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:31,050
people working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on integrating this no</font>

1003
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:34,350
higher layers that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a point that I</font>

1004
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:38,520
was making<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> defect with</font>

1005
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:40,380
ekt is isolated it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be you</font>

1006
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,820
know how do we want ekt to work in

1007
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:46,770
general and know what the documents

1008
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:50,520
going to modify that tunnel<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think has</font>

1009
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:53,340
to wait on the protocol document the

1010
00:47:50,520 --> 00:48:06,630
signaling documents to be further along

1011
00:47:53,340 --> 00:48:09,270
which is to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists so maybe I should</font>

1012
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:15,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">come to the fortress but um i'm not</font>

1013
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:17,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to except i wonder if the tunnel</font>

1014
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:20,430
document has enough extensibility in it

1015
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:22,859
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this matches message type struct it</font>

1016
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:25,140
has that if we needed different

1017
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:28,220
semantics out of it we could rev it just

1018
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:30,420
by defining some new message types

1019
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:32,939
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having to open up the patient</font>

1020
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:34,859
again I would hate for IETF process

1021
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:37,310
issue to show up on the wire and that's

1022
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:37,310
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're proposing</font>

1023
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:48,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything's got a version field right and</font>

1024
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:50,470
if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been paying attention to TLS</font>

1025
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:55,089
lately version fields are are useless

1026
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:56,828
unless you use them so<font color="#CCCCCC"> AI mean if you if</font>

1027
00:48:55,089 --> 00:48:58,660
you want me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay the property tax for</font>

1028
00:48:56,829 --> 00:49:01,200
this thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit inside perk for a few</font>

1029
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:04,000
more months I'm happy to do that I mean

1030
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,799
the prospect that you're worried about

1031
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">having one additional document sitting</font>

1032
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:11,320
there you know missing milestones from

1033
00:49:08,109 --> 00:49:12,790
time to time seems little academic well

1034
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,470
see i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was probably close the working</font>

1035
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:17,230
group once we<font color="#CCCCCC"> cut these all push-ups the</font>

1036
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:20,078
iesg sure but that's not happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> until</font>

1037
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:22,900
the signaling documents move forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1038
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:25,060
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that that well back to Rody's</font>

1039
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:27,730
point though if nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to do the</font>

1040
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:29,560
signaling then we're not going to do the

1041
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:30,910
signal if no one wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the</font>

1042
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,070
signaling close the group and don't

1043
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:35,348
publish these well no<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think that</font>

1044
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:37,810
follows because if we have these specs

1045
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:39,550
out for the media layer then they define

1046
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:41,440
a system that people can go out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

1047
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:44,440
and see if they can integrate with into

1048
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:46,510
into real systems the prospect of

1049
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:49,900
putting together an interoperable system

1050
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:56,290
based on what's here and no signaling

1051
00:49:49,900 --> 00:50:01,150
seems very low<font color="#E5E5E5"> a winch interoperable</font>

1052
00:49:56,290 --> 00:50:03,460
parts me if the MV and the KD came from

1053
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:06,040
the same vendor but the endpoints for

1054
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">different vendor is a very different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1055
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,980
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very different question than if the</font>

1056
00:50:07,569 --> 00:50:12,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">katy and md are coming from different</font>

1057
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:16,300
vendors do you get what I'm say yes yeah

1058
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:18,910
for for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> like if I think in some</font>

1059
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:21,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the scenarios at least I've seen</font>

1060
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:23,920
mooted from the endpoints point of view

1061
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:27,189
the signaling looks pretty much like

1062
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,079
standard SD p except you're going to

1063
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,849
negotiate double and Dewey que te on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1064
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:33,220
wire so if you have this you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1065
00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:34,440
implement an<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint they can imprint</font>

1066
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,129
interoperate with all sorts of

1067
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">conferences however you do this</font>

1068
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:40,150
signaling as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have that kind</font>

1069
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:42,250
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know standardization property so</font>

1070
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:46,290
that you know you can make some progress

1071
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:46,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">with just this document</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sup</font>

1072
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:56,480
just to add to what Richard said now we

1073
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:59,510
do have a prototype implementation that

1074
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:02,660
takes or the double and parts of tunnel

1075
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:05,300
and thus is to be magic to do it but

1076
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:07,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's you hack the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> htp to negotiate a</font>

1077
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:09,440
different cipher that's not a real

1078
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:13,070
production implementation but it can be

1079
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,750
done right it's easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say i have this</font>

1080
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,829
working with stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wrote and</font>

1081
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:18,170
stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wrote the stuff that i</font>

1082
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:25,460
wrote it's but if you do that you don't

1083
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:26,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">need the ITF sure so I'll tell you what</font>

1084
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:29,480
I just heard call and say that he's not

1085
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:32,180
opposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like putting his own pen down</font>

1086
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:34,099
to paper so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if I can like twist</font>

1087
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:39,799
his arm into doing something and I'll

1088
00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:41,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">help him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so i think i</font>

1089
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:44,030
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two of us in a copy editor</font>

1090
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:46,490
will get together and and try to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

1091
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:47,990
with something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that works here do you</font>

1092
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:51,560
think we can have something for Chicago

1093
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:53,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah it's realistic ok so I'm sorry</font>

1094
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,078
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to throw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something in the</font>

1095
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:55,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle of this working if it's going to</font>

1096
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">cause you to continue to do work as a</font>

1097
00:51:55,490 --> 00:52:01,399
chair but I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have just</font>

1098
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:03,859
committed to having something at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

1099
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:16,609
in either sip or WebRTC probably web RTC

1100
00:52:03,859 --> 00:52:19,640
for the signaling Ronnie what I heard

1101
00:52:16,609 --> 00:52:21,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">from Colin I mean it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from colin is</font>

1102
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:24,109
that the one that we need I mean the two

1103
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,910
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to clarify the first</font>

1104
00:52:24,109 --> 00:52:30,160
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how do the endpoint know</font>

1105
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:33,140
that it has to do this double double

1106
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:36,529
scription and the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how how</font>

1107
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:38,960
the MK f and the media distribution

1108
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:40,640
connect to each other and learn about

1109
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">each other I don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1110
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,618
<font color="#CCCCCC">complicated but I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think you can</font>

1111
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:47,750
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a solution without having this this</font>

1112
00:52:45,619 --> 00:52:49,900
title so it's not only it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not only the</font>

1113
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:52,640
part that can come from the same way

1114
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:55,069
vendo the nkf and the and the video

1115
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,900
distributor but also the<font color="#CCCCCC"> endpoint how to</font>

1116
00:52:55,069 --> 00:52:59,410
know that it must do this proper

1117
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,410
coordinates

1118
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:05,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so sounds like the plan i'm i'm</font>

1119
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:07,420
i'm hearing consensus on a plan of

1120
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:09,939
roughly of christian you know go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead</font>

1121
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:11,950
yeah it's just saying for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the work on</font>

1122
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:15,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> clue it would really need the web</font>

1123
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:16,810
RTC signaling so it's like sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

1124
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:18,790
continue until we have some sort of

1125
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:21,460
signaling solutions I've be interested

1126
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:24,730
in that yeah so maybe like the three or

1127
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:26,830
four you guys could be able get

1128
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:29,200
something started there so yeah so of

1129
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:31,180
saying I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I'm hearing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coalescence</font>

1130
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:37,359
around a plan of roughly the following

1131
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:40,089
form we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can take the e Katie double and</font>

1132
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:43,360
framework drafts and start progressing

1133
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:45,790
them on ekt may be lagging a little bit

1134
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:51,610
behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> but start getting those last</font>

1135
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:54,610
called and into the queue um the will

1136
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:57,490
give this this little team until<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chicago</font>

1137
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:58,600
to produce something for signaling and

1138
00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:00,759
then we'll take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a look at what we've got</font>

1139
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:04,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">there and we'll leave tunnel open</font>

1140
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:07,210
pending that work that sound about<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1141
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:10,359
Adams giving me a thumbs up running yeah

1142
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:12,100
I think I think ability because you're

1143
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,990
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cost to reviewers any on all</font>

1144
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:15,610
documents not also<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tunnel so</font>

1145
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:17,859
whether you call it working group last

1146
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:19,420
call as a reviewer do review prayer

1147
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:21,130
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> class call I don't think it</font>

1148
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:22,720
makes much different you can do it a new

1149
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:24,640
class call on all of them if you want I

1150
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:28,089
mean it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same thing because you</font>

1151
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:31,210
know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reviews now yeah alright</font>

1152
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:37,800
so with that let me write down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the names</font>

1153
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:37,800
of the dress start calling your names

1154
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:51,598
yeah we are progressing ekt so<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what</font>

1155
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:59,410
I'm about to do is ask for reviewers for

1156
00:54:51,599 --> 00:55:03,790
ekt double tunnel and framework those

1157
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:06,730
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all going to progress more or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> less</font>

1158
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:12,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll probably go ahead and start</font>

1159
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:14,680
pushing ekt double and framework through

1160
00:55:12,069 --> 00:55:17,200
the iesg process once we've gotten done

1161
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:19,270
with working group stuff and tunnel we

1162
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:24,040
will leave open pending signaling

1163
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:26,619
discussion Thank You<font color="#E5E5E5"> mo so we have four</font>

00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:07,140
this one has a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more relation</font>

1175
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:14,829
signaling so maybe smaller I guys Ronnie

1176

<font color="#CCCCCC">right so Ronnie and column and finally</font>

1178
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:26,940
the framework draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you again one</font>

1179
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:26,940
more

1184
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:48,069
you don't see them but that overall

1185
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:55,420
sounds like a plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look forward to</font>

1186
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:56,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing the work from yeah roughly it in</font>

00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:11,440
up with again don't leave it until

1192
