the jabber room if they'd be willing to

19
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,540
that's on the other yeah

20

yesterday

22
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">why we're working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this slides are posted</font>

23
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:41,560
so if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> copy them down to your</font>

24
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,560
computer until<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get this going we can</font>

25
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:54,320
do it without without projecting

26
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:58,010
hopefully this will yes I posted this

27
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:05,360
morning a higher echelon white guy by

28
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:08,570
posting this morning p so this is modern

29
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:13,130
again if you here for return that starts

30
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:17,150
at eleven o'clock so next thing would be

31
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:20,230
imagined<font color="#CCCCCC"> note well I think we've all</font>

32
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,950
seen know well enough times that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

33
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:26,030
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to have a show in</font>

34
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:30,830
anyways but no<font color="#CCCCCC"> weldon it well the agenda</font>

35
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:33,950
we have three topics one is advancing

36
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:36,650
the problem statement document and then

37
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:39,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chris and and and John will both present</font>

38
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:43,849
the the drafts that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> submitted prior</font>

39
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,530
to the meeting agenda bashing if there's

40
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:52,280
anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> people would like to talk</font>

41
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:54,559
about police say so so on the on the

42
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,630
problem statement draft we went through

43
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group last call and got 0</font>

44
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:03,200
comments and i think as has happened

45
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,180
with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some other working groups</font>

46
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,460
the stir is kind of taken all the oxygen

47
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:16,940
out of the room for four related topics

48
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:20,320
or other topics they're leaving<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

49
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:26,000
so I need to do my shadow puppets<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

50
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:30,200
so anyway in order to to advance the

51
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,150
draft we need a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more review and</font>

52
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,030
comment on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it not a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font>

53
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:37,909
but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could get a couple volunteers</font>

54
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,200
to to take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the draft and post</font>

55
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:44,690
comments on the list that would be very

56
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:49,318
<font color="#E5E5E5">helpful in the framework document yes</font>

57
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:52,199
okay thanks Adam anybody else be willing

58
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,720
to inning great thanks I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

59
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,190
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sufficient right yeah okay</font>

60
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,020
anybody else<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wants to please do i</font>

61
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,130
mean the more the merrier but we just

62
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,250
need to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that we show enough</font>

63
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:04,789
interest and then enough indication that

64
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:12,259
the draft has been been looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

65
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:14,340
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and so again sorry for the</font>

66
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:18,380
difficulties here so next will be Chris

67
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,380
I guess if you can bring your

68
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:24,530
so I'll get started right yeah go ahead

69
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:32,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so I submitted a document</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we</font>

70
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:37,310
go identity registry so I this was a

71
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:42,200
basically a brain dump on something we'd

72
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:46,489
been working on internally and very

73
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:50,050
compatible with the concepts of modern

74
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:53,030
as well as some of the stuff bin tere I

75
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,979
think the goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is to maybe talk</font>

76
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:58,610
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> and see where the commonalities</font>

77
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:00,080
are but i'll go ahead and pluck through

78
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,270
the slides talk through the document

79
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:07,880
first and and john can present and they

80
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:12,560
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can discuss afterwards so it's got a</font>

81
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:18,320
couple new things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe aren't part</font>

82
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:20,560
of the current Terry stuff it also has

83
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,470
we actually have an implementation that

84
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:27,619
we've used with the drip stuff so it's

85
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,630
sort of nice from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective as</font>

86
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,150
well and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll try to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about those</font>

87
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:34,460
how there's things sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hook in</font>

88
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:39,439
although trip the sort of generic so

89
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:44,150
it's not explicit thing so one thing we

90
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:46,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">do is explicitly associate services and</font>

91
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:49,400
the other probably big really big thing

92
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,740
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> model where you can have</font>

93
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,860
multiple public identity associations

94
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:57,890
and a routing identifier that's sort of

95
00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:00,220
explicitly a related but separate thing

96
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:05,600
I'll talk through that a little more

97
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:07,990
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> page so the actors in this model</font>

98
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,960
and I have the diagram on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next page</font>

99
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:14,000
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main actors in in this</font>

100
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:17,540
relational model and that's how I sort

101
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">of modeled in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the document is the</font>

102
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:23,510
provider the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually provides</font>

103
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:28,040
the service and manages customers and

104
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:30,200
manages the network probably the user

105
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,920
subscribers so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> person that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

106
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,510
did the actual human being that is

107
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:40,569
subscribing to some service from the

108
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:42,680
provider the service identity that's the

109
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:44,470
identity of the service that the

110
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,989
subscriber is actually subscribing to

111
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:50,060
and it's important to note<font color="#CCCCCC"> here you a</font>

112
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:55,760
provider could offer multiple services

113
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:57,880
that a user can subscribe to or the same

114
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,050
public identity could be associated to

115
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,960
multiple services across multiple

116
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:06,349
provider so just flexible from that

117
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:10,010
point of view the public identity is

118
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:12,850
generally something that you can prove

119
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,660
an identity of so telephone<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

120
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously being one that we're</font>

121
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,969
interested here but that doesn't mean it

122
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:22,040
couldn't be extended to other forms of

123
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:26,300
identities<font color="#CCCCCC"> like email dresses and things</font>

124
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:29,569
like that and then routing identity

125
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:35,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be some probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> URI type of thing</font>

126
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:39,830
that I'll talk a little more about how

127
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,660
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using it but you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know in</font>

128
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:44,420
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> basic case it would just be like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

129
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,040
sip uri but the intent<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is that it's</font>

130
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:49,910
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of global globally</font>

131
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:53,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">growl double identity did you want to</font>

132
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:55,069
take questions the end or now I can I

133
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,560
can take the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> so just I wanted</font>

134
00:12:55,070 --> 00:13:00,949
it gone make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> I understood what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

135
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:03,500
meant by service at energy can you give

136
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:05,599
an example what that would be so I yeah

137
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,800
I have an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you know it</font>

138
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,910
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> boy as a service but it you</font>

139
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,189
could think of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as maybe an</font>

140
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:17,180
application so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

141
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:20,259
describing a user describing water

142
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:23,180
service itself like it would be

143
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:24,949
everybody who subscribes to messaging

144
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:31,489
service for example would have messaged

145
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:32,870
you know exactly yep yep<font color="#E5E5E5"> well John</font>

146
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,610
Peterson but you also mean like you know

147
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,410
Facebook's messenger service<font color="#E5E5E5"> every say</font>

148
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,730
it's it's globally unique that's I think

149
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:40,699
the interesting question about it is

150
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:43,160
this yes it's an enormous lie but yeah

151
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:46,810
actually that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> point so it can</font>

152
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:50,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unique in the scope of the provider</font>

153
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:52,518
it could also be globally unique so like

154
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,839
boy probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be a one that you</font>

155
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:55,250
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be globally unique because you</font>

156
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,410
have multiple providers but it could

157
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:03,370
also be unique within a provider and we

158
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:05,449
use sort of a qualified<font color="#E5E5E5"> domain</font>

159
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:08,990
convention at least that we've

160
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:12,709
implemented so it would be like voice

161
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:14,600
comcast com or something yeah so this

162
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:18,680
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> pond the only when if you talk</font>

163
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,420
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this later just okay but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I the</font>

164
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,880
idea of when I can see people have

165
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,979
talked about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for many years</font>

166
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,130
about having essentially separate

167
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:30,199
providers for different generic services

168
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:32,180
so i could have an SMS provider who

169
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:35,000
example and the voice provider to take

170
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:37,069
of a realistic example yeah I and in

171
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,230
this case I would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two records 1</font>

172
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:41,510
which said SMS we have one that says

173
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:44,110
voice I don't really care who provides

174
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:47,209
voice except for routing identify oh I

175
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:49,040
but I do care if i want to allowed it to

176
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:52,369
that that actually turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to be a</font>

177
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:55,630
wheel nutone problem to the extent that

178
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,769
you followed it for real-time text<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

179
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:59,630
because it will likely be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a combination</font>

180
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:01,310
of over the top

181
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:05,770
vacations that provide real-time text

182
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:09,199
and a classical ims whatever type of

183
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:10,760
legacy voice type of model<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I need to</font>

184
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,620
out separately they're going to be in

185
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:16,010
different providers probably maybe

186
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:19,160
whiteley will provide on<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT side and</font>

187
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:21,290
classic provide on the other so that's

188
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,630
why it makes a big difference whether it

189
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,699
says well I say is a hierarchy implied

190
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:28,550
so that I I don't care that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's voice</font>

191
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:31,060
comcast all I need to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> its voice and</font>

192
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:33,949
I'm good is that what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying yeah</font>

193
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:37,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">so the may be either step back a little</font>

194
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:40,940
bit the intent is that I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

195
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,740
want to contact ending at two one five

196
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,990
five five five one two one two and I

197
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:47,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to contact you for real-time text</font>

198
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:51,050
for example so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look in the registry I</font>

199
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:52,490
do a query for the service of our TT for

200
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,530
the public idea of two one five five

201
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:57,140
five five one two one two and I get a

202
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:58,970
globally unique routing ID that goes to

203
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:03,920
the provider<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's exactly what I</font>

204
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:05,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all we could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yep yep any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clear i</font>

205
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,790
think that is totally in keeping with

206
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,440
what's in my frame were again<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

207
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,760
what's in Terry right there is a subject

208
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,380
to these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually you</font>

209
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:23,030
can use to specify those rights like

210
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:24,500
that and so yeah yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next page so</font>

211
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:27,140
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the diagram that's in the</font>

212
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:31,400
document and use sort of a relational

213
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:33,920
model here so actors and verbs to

214
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:39,020
describe how they're related and used to

215
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,670
be with each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> so hopefully</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

216
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,770
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just explained what we just</font>

217
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:55,160
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about unless there's any other</font>

218
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:57,380
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right pictures are good i</font>

219
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:02,410
guess i could try to incorporate arrows

220
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,410
in the text thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> no we'll see yeah</font>

221
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:15,918
yeah the problem

222
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:17,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is sort of a general</font>

223
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,299
description of some of the API functions

224
00:17:17,749 --> 00:17:22,909
that I think we've talked about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

225
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:26,089
came a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit from some of the stuff</font>

226
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:30,700
we try to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> before stir sort of</font>

227
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:35,799
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> over in the N</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I working group</font>

228
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:38,659
but so you know basic requirements for

229
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:43,609
telephone numbers and identity and can

230
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:49,129
be extended to identity so the ability

231
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:52,189
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have unique identifiers where there's</font>

232
00:17:49,129 --> 00:17:55,369
no single owner enforcing that and

233
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:58,340
having a pool that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be queried for</font>

234
00:17:55,369 --> 00:18:03,230
available things that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably more</font>

235
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:06,080
relevant to telephone numbers and then

236
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:09,019
the ability to support block levels and

237
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,830
perhaps wild cards on on other<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of</font>

238
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:15,619
identities the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to update</font>

239
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:18,080
transfer import identity so update

240
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:24,320
providers update transferring transfer

241
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:26,570
them and then signing transactions which

242
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,710
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> John has in his document as well</font>

243
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:39,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">and and then the distributed registry</font>

244
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:41,389
thing yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is up just to talk</font>

245
00:18:39,499 --> 00:18:45,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the distributed registry a little</font>

246
00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:48,168
bit actually in the diagram have one

247
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:51,649
thing I noted as private the user

248
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:53,720
subscribers so obviously details of the

249
00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:58,518
user subscribers should stay private to

250
00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:00,440
the provider but we expose basically we

251
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:03,350
would expose some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the restful</font>

252
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,330
interfaces that we develop here to the

253
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:08,090
distributed registry in order to do gets

254
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:10,389
and puts against when updates are made

255
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:14,389
and you know get pushed over the

256
00:19:10,389 --> 00:19:17,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">distributed channels and that's sort of</font>

257
00:19:14,389 --> 00:19:21,199
essentially we would map those into the

258
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:22,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">specific implementation of the registry</font>

259
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:32,420
hooked into

260
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:39,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">dripping in the case of drip okay</font>

261
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:45,680
messaging<font color="#E5E5E5"> and control flow so there we</font>

262
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:47,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">go as I explained to you haning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

263
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,030
queries would always be in the context

264
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,250
of public identity and the service so

265
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:56,060
that's sort of a unique pair that would

266
00:19:52,250 --> 00:20:03,260
identify which routing ID would be used

267
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:05,480
to route and just talked about global

268
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:10,070
uniqueness as well so you know the

269
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:12,020
allocation must be unique we need to

270
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,240
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there isn't any race</font>

271
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:17,629
conditions in terms of allocating

272
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,910
numbers so the idea that if you did a

273
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:22,730
yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> check if something's available</font>

274
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,350
and then you try to do a put<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

275
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:28,730
make sure there's no race conditions for

276
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:29,990
somebody else getting in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> between and</font>

277
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,750
that's sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of covered in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drift</font>

278
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:40,790
draft but it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to note in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this as</font>

279
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:43,820
well so next slide is a an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example the</font>

280
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:47,720
telephone<font color="#CCCCCC"> number would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the public ID</font>

281
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:52,310
in this case service ID could be void as

282
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:54,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">I described before and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT and other</font>

283
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:56,000
things and whether they're globally

284
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,830
unique from up that a rated point of

285
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,570
view or if the provider just wants to

286
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:02,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide a unique</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> service that's possible</font>

287
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:07,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well too although less important for</font>

288
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:10,010
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> distributed case the suggestion here</font>

289
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,310
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the routing ID would this is</font>

290
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:15,320
sort of another important concept that

291
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:19,909
at least that we have implemented it

292
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:22,010
that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case of the sip uri the</font>

293
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:24,890
domain actually represents both the

294
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:27,379
provider and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the service so i think i</font>

295
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:29,270
mentioned before like<font color="#E5E5E5"> VoIP example.com</font>

296
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:32,480
would be the domain because it's the

297
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:34,540
service ID and then the domain of that

298
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,260
represents the provider and then the

299
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:43,430
identity is put

300
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:48,170
for the at sign and then sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

301
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:51,260
time stamp signature and the pointer to

302
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:54,860
the public key which i think aligns with

303
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:56,330
what John has in his document yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jen</font>

304
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">Peterson again I think it is definitely</font>

305
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,320

306
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,580
interested in about this I guess and we

307
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,620
can get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the spit we talked about</font>

308
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,240
how this<font color="#E5E5E5"> aligns the Terry data model the</font>

309
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:08,629
degree to which you think the routing ID

310
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,390
should encode in the domain what the

311
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:12,890
service is in a sense of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it is</font>

312
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:14,840
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up a lot in</font>

313
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:16,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> early architecture phenom like is</font>

314
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">cipa service and if so what service to</font>

315
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:21,400
sip provide right<font color="#CCCCCC"> sit provides this this</font>

316
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:24,110
one day boo function that allows

317
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">endpoints to explain their capabilities</font>

318
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,889
and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of negotiate what communication</font>

319
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:30,680
you know protocols<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have in common</font>

320
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:34,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know this this cars no matter</font>

321
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:35,840
how what goes into the the routing

322
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,730
infrastructure right that lets you find

323
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,010
discover the<font color="#CCCCCC"> endpoint you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to reach</font>

324
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:41,660
versus what then should the two

325
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,010
endpoints negotiate among themselves is

326
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:45,410
a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting like architectural</font>

327
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:47,300
vision I definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need something</font>

328
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:49,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">like what you have here for a service ID</font>

329
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,590
the less you say the routing idea i'm

330
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,030
looking for is the one for boy right and

331
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:55,669
what that means is that the things

332
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:57,139
return should work for that if knows but

333
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,970
it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a problem if it also</font>

334
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">worked for video</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is my question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

335
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:02,450
thank you you want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be you know and</font>

336
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:04,699
i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is part of the definition</font>

337
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:07,910
of what that service ID represents right

338
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,860
but for me it's also like you know if

339
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:11,600
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> routes into my network if it's</font>

340
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:14,389
VoIP<font color="#E5E5E5"> i might want to send it here if</font>

341
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,830
it's rtti my one's got it<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you know</font>

342
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,750
so there's a whole bunch of other things

343
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:21,590
and its global<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique is called so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

344
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:24,830
think there's a couple things there but

345
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:27,350
the idea would be even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though it's using</font>

346
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:30,020
sip as a signaling protocol which is

347
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:32,810
sort of generic your your qualifying

348
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:34,760
what that identity is intended to

349
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:37,040
represent in terms of the service that's

350
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,200
being offered within the Sultan your sip

351
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,730
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I guess we you know</font>

352
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,830
the substance my<font color="#CCCCCC"> calmness</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really that</font>

353
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,480
probably as we look at like aligning

354
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:47,449
this model before doing a Terry I would

355
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably argue that there will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be other</font>

356
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:50,090
ways like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the records and things that</font>

357
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,000
here your flat

358
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:54,860
to show what the routing uses of these

359
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,529
things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know encoding them in the</font>

360
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,370
domain that way is a very specific

00:23:56,529 --> 00:24:00,529
implementation specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I to address</font>

362
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:03,260
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> amending it nice in other ways yeah</font>

363
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:05,390
wants to be how we did it but certainly

364
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,740
welcome for feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope that this if</font>

365
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,850
these were broken some flexibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

366
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,770
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there might be advantages to</font>

367
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:11,299
having separate ways to signal that both

368
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:17,539
in this routing layer and then down<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

369
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:22,460
simpler yep thank Dave Crocker similar

370
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:25,279
or related question this appears to be

371
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:28,000
the by virtue of having the routing ID

372
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:31,880
somewhere in the realm of source routing

373
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:37,039
rather than the model which moves the

374
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:39,529
routing to the real-time query<font color="#CCCCCC"> at X at</font>

375
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:42,260
execution<font color="#E5E5E5"> time so that you take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

376
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:44,000
target<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you want you use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to</font>

377
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:47,629
find some real time information rather

378
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,600
than embedding it into the request any

379
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:53,960
thoughts about why you're you're taking

380
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,029
the embedded approach if I'm

381
00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:01,970
understanding correctly which is always

382
00:24:56,029 --> 00:25:04,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">following what you're saying so the I</font>

383
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:06,710
always use email references so that's

384
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:10,158
what I'll do um once upon<font color="#CCCCCC"> time you</font>

385
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:12,230
actually could embed a source route into

386
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,120
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> address there would be the place you</font>

387
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:16,460
want to go to but you'd say go get there

388
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,620
via this and this and this yeah and that

389
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,140
was in what the author would specify

390
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:23,330
yeah and you might guess that wouldn't

391
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:26,120
scale real well you'd be right right um

392
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:27,889
and and so the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> model is I say</font>

393
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,899
where I want to go yeah and the

394
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:32,510
underlying infrastructure does a bunch

395
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:36,949
of queries and later x-ray of silliness

396
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:39,049
MX is the obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> reference</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

397
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:42,070
appears to be more like source routing

398
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:45,740
if i'm understanding well so it could be

399
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:51,379
flexible but the intent is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it</font>

400
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:54,289
more straightforward yes attending

401
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:56,330
speaking of a difference to email was it

402
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:58,490
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> monitors generally speaking one</font>

403
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:03,169
service<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more flavors to it as to</font>

404
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:05,360
its capabilities yeah I and here

405
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:08,480
you have a problem that you have a

406
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:13,250
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify or phone number in this</font>

407
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:15,620
case and multiple services operated by

408
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:18,530
differently administered<font color="#E5E5E5"> lee distinct</font>

409
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:21,169
bodies yes and they could be overlap in

410
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:23,540
a sense that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could have a service at</font>

411
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:25,160
our foes messaging and voice and video

412
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,320
and you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a service that only</font>

413
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:30,340
offers messaging for example to take a

<font color="#E5E5E5">game possible example right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eye and</font>

00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:35,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">messaging could be pop pop I tell you or</font>

417
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:40,370
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you do clearly have a</font>

418
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,419
possibility you could do late binding in

419
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:44,389
a sense you just have a bunch of

420
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,950
identifiers and see whether if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak</font>

00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,740
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol whether it supports</font>

422
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:50,360
anywhere things that you care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and</font>

423
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:53,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you just have to try until you find</font>

424
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:56,300
something or you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially do a</font>

425
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:58,430
hint as to what services you might even

426
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:00,560
want to look at I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> not because they</font>

427
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:04,220
generally don't change all that much if

428
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:07,010
over time I as long as both models are

429
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:09,620
supported I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it as source</font>

430
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:12,110
routing as such as in more as a service

00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:14,540
selection<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am like what kind of</font>

434
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:24,370
the problem will be and I don't know how

435
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:28,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">you envision handling that for services</font>

436
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:31,370
for routing IDs and handle multiple

437
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:33,860
services in combination let's say voice

438
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:36,709
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> video just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take an example if they</font>

439
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:40,520
are separable would maybe two entries or

440
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:42,920
would maybe a multivalued service ID as

441
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:45,200
it would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a numeration of this thing</font>

442
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:47,390
can do voice video<font color="#E5E5E5"> text say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll take a</font>

443
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,180
classical version but that changes how

444
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:54,200
you do lock up the changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

445
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:57,170
relational structure your database I it

446
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,750
changes my ability to for example ask

447
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:01,790
for service that supports all three at

448
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:04,520
the same time which might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I</font>

449
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:06,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">care about all of that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think all that</font>

450
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:09,110
is intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> because one of the things</font>

451
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:11,480
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an interesting use case is sort</font>

452
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:14,570
of what carriers are supporting today in

453
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,790
terms of I have my legacy sip I have

454
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:18,620
multi<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have our CS</font>

455
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:20,240
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> might want them to enter the</font>

456
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,070
network at the same place but then I

457
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,320
might have other logic internally

458
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:26,899
routing logic that might push them to

459
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,909
the rcs specific services or other

460
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,430
things so we could either do that

461
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:33,560
explicitly in the registry or implicitly

462
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:37,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then have internal routing logic</font>

463
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,929
that could so I think it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good to</font>

464
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,870
support both models and then the carrier

465
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:45,350
or provider can decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> how they want to</font>

466
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:47,449
treat those identities because yeah we

467
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:53,300
have a use case as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

468
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:55,130
sort of a you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we offer messaging</font>

469
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:58,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">invoice and other things and we sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

470
00:28:55,130 --> 00:29:02,690
have an umbrella service<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we use as</font>

471
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:04,580
an identifier and and and and do that

472
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then split</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off depending on the</font>

473
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,590
application but I could see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> both ways</font>

474
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:10,880
actually do<font color="#E5E5E5"> Crocker again just for</font>

475
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,899
completeness is something that I'm

476
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty sure everybody in the room</font>

477
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:17,540
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hennings point about</font>

478
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:20,570
multiple service is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> prompted going</font>

479
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:22,129
from MX to create the SRV record so that

480
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:27,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">you could underneath register for</font>

481
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:28,910
different services yep yeah um<font color="#E5E5E5"> also just</font>

482
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">in terms of Terry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lemon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry John</font>

483
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:33,590
Peterson one<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting about the Terry</font>

484
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:36,439
models we do have in fact explicit

485
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:37,820
source routing in it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sense of you</font>

486
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,830
know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept of the source of a</font>

487
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:42,560
query and their kin there can also be

488
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:44,750
though the crowd<font color="#E5E5E5"> source for this query</font>

489
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,610
tell me what the route should be if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

490
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:48,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the source of the traffic in other</font>

491
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:50,300
words are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> anticipated source of the</font>

492
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">traffic um and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a property i</font>

493
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,060
think that turns be very meaningful for

494
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,649
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> those kinds of service</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> writer</font>

495
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:57,020
cases you're describing or inside of a

496
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:58,760
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and there will be if your</font>

497
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,350
route sources inside it then it's great

498
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,150
you need to exit through particular

499
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:03,830
gateways or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> for particular</font>

500
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,690
services which would be very different

501
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:07,699
if you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just out on the internet say</font>

502
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:09,440
yeah so that is something I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

503
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely needs to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a part of the the</font>

504
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,890
model<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

505
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:27,220
I guess next page and then just wrapping

506
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:29,710
up here with some<font color="#CCCCCC"> more details I</font>

507
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:34,270
included in case we need the discussion

508
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:37,420
but I think we've covered a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it so</font>

509
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:39,430
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of the API specific stuff</font>

510
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:42,940
that we need you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> intended</font>

511
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:45,430
to to provide guidance some I do have

512
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,990
some API references documented didn't

513
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:48,430
have a chance to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put them in but I</font>

514
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:50,970
figured we should talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it before</font>

515
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:54,190
we start defining interfaces so

516
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:57,100
basically the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Up Jayd entries</font>

517
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:59,020
porting numbers it gets inputs that are

518
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:02,290
put in posts that are associated with

519
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:05,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and then on the next page removal</font>

520
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:08,470
removal the allocation if it's telephone

521
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,149
numbers the ability to put that

522
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:12,580
telephone back into the pool of

523
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:19,740
available to telephone numbers some

524
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:19,740
those concepts so that's the overview

525
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font>

526
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:27,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay John</font>

527
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:37,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">John Peterson you know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is really</font>

528
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:38,710
great for a number of reasons this is

529
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of what we've needed in modern for</font>

530
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,910
some time we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been having a relatively</font>

531
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:45,040
abstract discussion about kind of what

532
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:47,230
we think the principles would be that we

533
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:50,440
would need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say address the enum</font>

534
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:53,440
like problem in a more<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rev like I guess</font>

535
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,600
way home to try to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out a rich</font>

536
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,300
query semantics<font color="#CCCCCC"> that'll let you express</font>

537
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,909
interesting questions about numbering

538
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,740
resources that will let you create

539
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:05,170
records related to numbering resources

540
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:07,720
they'll let you have these records exist

541
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:09,010
in a clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of scrub ecosystem you</font>

542
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,170
can create them you can update them you

543
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,090
can delete<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and so on and I think</font>

544
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:16,750
this some go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next line I'm sure</font>

545
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:19,060
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been a perennial difficulty for</font>

546
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:20,860
us as we look to extend enum or even to

547
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:22,899
try to figure out kind of provisioning

548
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:24,550
systems that would work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you Nam in</font>

549
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,440
the past because we never really looked

550
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,669
at it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that perspective of the</font>

551
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,160
record being something what kind of

552
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:32,980
atomically move through that life cycle

553
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,990
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is of course you can't</font>

554
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:37,150
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> define much about that</font>

555
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:39,310
information model and Terry is in fact

556
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">the information model without having</font>

557
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,850
some of the concrete examples that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

558
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,050
want to work with of what the data

559
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,879
elements would be that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really put</font>

560
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:47,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">into it like we can define in the</font>

561
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,020
abstract what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like but this</font>

562
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">chris's presentation there is a great</font>

563
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:54,040
example of the kind of thing the Terry

564
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,720
model should be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do if we look at</font>

565
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,159
Terry and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually we can't figure</font>

566
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">out how to map the kinds of things chris</font>

567
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,610
is talking about to Terry that<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

568
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,200
we did a terrible valve job designing it

569
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,939
because this should be a layout this

570
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,650
should be very straightforward these for

571
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,980
us to figure out how to slot it in and

572
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:10,960
how to extend it to accommodate that so

573
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,850
let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a bit just about Terry</font>

574
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">before i get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the new document and</font>

575
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:16,449
into alignment with chris's stuff now we

576
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,340
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft it's called draft Peterson</font>

577
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:20,080
modern carry this is for telephone

578
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:22,810
related information that's what Terry is

579
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,399
short for we now<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a 02 of this again</font>

580
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:26,620
still an individual submission we've

581
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,540
been having difficulty as Steve

582
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:31,270
intimated earlier getting enough

583
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:32,889
eyeballs on the framework<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carrie is in</font>

584
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:36,250
fact an instantiation of that framework

585
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:39,280
pretty directly so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think when we feel</font>

586
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:40,720
we've got that a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more solid we can</font>

587
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,120
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about whether or not Terry should</font>

588
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">be something that we'd adopt really only</font>

589
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,909
made a couple more to

590
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,230
to it though honestly I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean again I</font>

591
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:49,120
think based on some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things in</font>

592
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,600
Chris's draft i can see ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> i might</font>

593
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,100
extend it maybe even change some of the

594
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,659
fundamental elements<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> imagined or</font>

595
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,830
associated with records based on the way

596
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">chris is looking at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it there are a</font>

597
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:00,129
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas i'm going to talk about i</font>

598
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,590
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably should be promoted into</font>

599
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:03,790
that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think kind of the next step</font>

600
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:06,610
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk through</font>

601
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:08,889
today um is what we think would look

602
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:11,230
like to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chris's model and to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

603
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:15,040
a Terry binding that is based on that

604
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:17,168
exact registry model since it's

605
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">just an abstract model</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I also noticed I</font>

606
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:21,580
think it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hard for us to talk</font>

607
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:23,560
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this in too much of the abstracts</font>

608
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:26,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wanted to at least show a data format</font>

609
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,449
that we could mint these records into

610
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:30,159
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've just been talking about the</font>

611
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:31,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">information model very at a very high</font>

612
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,520
level these are the fields the<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine</font>

613
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:37,659
won't be in it so I put out a little bit

614
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:39,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a straw man draft slide that will</font>

615
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:42,340
show um I guess I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

616
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:45,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">strong them on the next slide but that</font>

617
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:48,730
that is trying to put Terry into<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON in</font>

618
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:50,560
a pretty casual way I'd say at this

619
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:52,240
point because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we do want to know</font>

620
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,590
that we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the right data elements</font>

621
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:59,169
again given something like Chris's

622
00:34:53,590 --> 00:35:00,760
registry example vodka slide so what we

623
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:03,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">really want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to do with these</font>

624
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">JSON elements they'll be talking about</font>

625
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:07,359
today is to fulfill what we call the

626
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,950
cherry operations and this speaks very

627
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,600
much to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the API calls that Chris was</font>

628
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:12,939
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> referring to with his gets inputs</font>

629
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,890
and boots and so on we want to really

630
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:17,140
have three<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could do with</font>

631
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:19,509
Carrie you want to be able to acquire

632
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:21,009
numbers this is both the searching

633
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:22,960
capability you're referring<font color="#CCCCCC"> to how do i</font>

634
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:25,060
interrogate number inventory and then

635
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,010
get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single number or walk of numbers</font>

636
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:28,810
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that inventory and have that be</font>

637
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:30,580
assigned<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me now at least whatever</font>

638
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:33,250
that that attestation of assigning means

639
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,779
no Terry contacts there's a management

640
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:37,240
operation that both enables you to

641
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:39,130
provision initial information against

642
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,319
the those records when they've been

643
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:43,300
acquired in that fashion<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll also let</font>

644
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,140
you modify them port them things like

645
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,330
that would all fall under that

646
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:48,069
management operation and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally</font>

647
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:49,600
the retrieval operation retrievals will

648
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:51,820
restart<font color="#CCCCCC"> that retrieval is the enum</font>

649
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,799
basically problem of<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we know that</font>

650
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:55,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">their records out there for this given</font>

651
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,930
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am given the situation of the</font>

652
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,950
network resources associated with that

653
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:01,390
how do I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that information who do I</font>

654
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:03,879
ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what is the career you need to</font>

655
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:05,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">look like when again the core concede is</font>

656
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,240
that we've looked at these kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

657
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,310
isolation you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've gone through</font>

658
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:12,129
these efforts like that spearmint or let

659
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:14,290
drinks enum we<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at parts of these</font>

660
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:15,850
and the conceit here is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously</font>

661
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:17,770
these protocols are all accessing and

662
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:20,380
mutating a related set of information

663
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:22,330
some kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> anatomic record and so</font>

664
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,880
Terry's ambition is to provide a common

665
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:27,310
information model for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that record itself</font>

666
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:35,740
and then for these operations that that

667
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:39,520
operate on the records next time so it

668
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:40,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">looks like this um this should look at</font>

669
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,550
least somewhat similar to chris's

670
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:46,050
picture though a bit different the

671
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:49,000
service provider in this kind of model

672
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:50,770
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> this the communication service</font>

673
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,870
fire could fulfill any one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main</font>

674
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:54,580
roles that we see a mess obviously the

675
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:55,870
intermediaries that client requests are

676
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,060
going through<font color="#CCCCCC"> is someplace</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the service</font>

677
00:36:55,870 --> 00:37:00,040
provider is likely to be that big thing

678
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:02,500
labeled services and another candidate

679
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:04,720
for it even the authorities on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the side</font>

680
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,980
so if AT&T owns a numbering resource and

681
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,299
they wanna be able to provision records

682
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,100
associated with it into one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

683
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,830
databases they could also be a service

684
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:14,049
provider so these are logical roles that

685
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:16,480
are played by participants in ecosystem

686
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:17,890
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine and we kind of base this</font>

687
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,840
on a DNS like model where their

688
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:21,790
registries and registrar's and register

689
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:24,070
and so on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> given that there's a</font>

690
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:25,630
separation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is at least logical in</font>

691
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:28,780
the architecture that we imagine that

692
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:30,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the ipn and I sorts of cases those</font>

693
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,170
functions<font color="#E5E5E5"> would largely be completely</font>

694
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,490
composed for the more distributed

695
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:35,200
registrated<font color="#CCCCCC"> case though that would</font>

696
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:37,089
actually be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different distributed</font>

697
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,220
register case would look much more like

698
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:41,260
where the authorities<font color="#E5E5E5"> that provision</font>

699
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,759
Terry records and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> tear records are</font>

700
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,320
then available to be queried by people

701
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,190
could be the service providers

702
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,750
themselves they would just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

703
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:48,730
authorities where these records the

704
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:51,220
service is a distributed thing lives out

705
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:52,720
in cloud or in the DHT and so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

706
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,669
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the service provider probably for</font>

707
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,009
a trip like case sir at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least it would</font>

708
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:59,140
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a layer of indirection from the</font>

709
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:00,610
service provider unless chris would like

710
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:04,480
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct me in my characterization of</font>

711
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:07,690
drug now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to understand what you</font>

712
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,090
said the difference between distributed

713
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:11,550
and on distributed so i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine you</font>

714
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:13,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">can imagine a case where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

715
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:15,600
who as<font color="#E5E5E5"> comcast obviously you have</font>

716
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,280
customers you're both the authority and

717
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,259
the service people query for those

718
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,480
customers then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can imagine a case</font>

719
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,490
where instead we move out the

720
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,490
intelligence<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people query into like</font>

721
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:28,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">a set and in this case you would</font>

722
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:29,490
remain the authority as a participant in

723
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,290
it in other words you be creating

724
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:34,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">regulate internal versus external view</font>

725
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:38,550
or sorry well so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean in this instance</font>

726
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:40,200
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the place that you query to learn</font>

727
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,480
these records from the retrieval

728
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,919
operation in a distributed registry but

729
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,380
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer necessarily be like your</font>

730
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,390
service right Comcast surface and we

731
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,980
live out in this cloud as a consequence

732
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:51,540
although you're the authority for it

733
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,970
logically<font color="#CCCCCC"> you generate the records you</font>

734
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:56,640
sign them and they go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the strip</font>

735
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:58,350
yes cloud you aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service anymore</font>

736
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,259
that literally get screwed in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font>

737
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:03,600
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> service and Terry right okay that's</font>

738
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,250
all I mean federated service versus an

739
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,750
individual server or even more radically

740
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:09,150
distributed than federated right i<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

741
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,980
you know again if you can kind of take

742
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,600
all of these DHT days to purchase their

743
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,130
logical logical extreme imagine a

744
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,440
registry that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coupled right</font>

745
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:19,200
from the operation of any individual

746
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,280
service provider right the other other

747
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,890
people get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this or other people</font>

748
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:31,860
uncomfortable shaking our heads I don't

749
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:35,120
know Alyssa Cooper um would then the

750
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:37,500
acquisition flow<font color="#E5E5E5"> also go through this</font>

751
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,990
federated distributed service and how

00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,990
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that relate to the authorities</font>

753
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:44,490
authority over acquiring<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure so I mean</font>

754
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:46,500
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tripp is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> based on the notion</font>

755
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:48,120
again I st to characterize your own

756
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,680
posle too much in front of you but yes

757
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:52,020
there would be some number ranges that

758
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,759
would have effectively be seated to this

759
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,440
distributed system and if you're a

760
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,910
protect you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend the system</font>

761
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,740
you can then<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the acquisition</font>

762
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:00,390
interface to<font color="#E5E5E5"> seize free numbering</font>

763
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:03,330
resources when you delete you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

764
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:04,890
release them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this right and what what</font>

765
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:06,810
what really deposition process always

766
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:08,839
gives you in Terry is authority but it

767
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:11,700
makes you into the person who then can

768
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:14,040
provision the records and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for</font>

769
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,330
the service these are the service fields

770
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,880
that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to associate with that in</font>

771
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:19,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> record so is there not a model where</font>

772
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,320
you would wear that would look

773
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:24,149
beneficial for retrieval but not for

774
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,080
acquisition like do those things that

775
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">they have to be</font>

776
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">no that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I totally agree there is I hope</font>

777
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,260
you get it is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific least as I</font>

778
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,730
understand that proposal for drip which

779
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,860
i think is based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this notion that you</font>

780
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,480
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> free in fact that I think that's</font>

781
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:38,190
essential can see that you want even the

782
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,080
acquisition dimension of that to be

783
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:41,700
distributed<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that way but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's totally</font>

784
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible to do the retrieval in that</font>

785
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,580
very distributed way and have the

786
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:51,060
acquisition actually be very centralized

787
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:53,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Henning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm too but I think</font>

788
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:55,740
it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be helpful to distinguish two</font>

789
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:57,450
kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution and we one is</font>

790
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:00,390
whatever what you might find is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

791
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:02,759
a physical distribution my more like if

792
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:04,950
you want to use month blockchain as an

793
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,920
example way of the idea is generally

794
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:12,480
speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> or ph key as you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned we</font>

795
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:14,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">are this is morphus cloud of</font>

796
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:18,050
independently possibly independently

797
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:21,750
resource entities but the ideal is that

798
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:23,660
collectively or<font color="#CCCCCC"> individually they all</font>

799
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:26,550
provide the same information they're not

800
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:31,350
acceptance a mechanical why like for DHT

801
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:33,600
we identify our just split by mechanical

802
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:36,770
reason like<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the DHT would identify</font>

803
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:39,779
ranges but there is no particularly

804
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:41,850
administrative coherence to that it's

805
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:44,940
not like one server holds a<font color="#CCCCCC"> TNT's</font>

806
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:46,410
records yellow one holds whatever the

807
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">Canadian records or something the</font>

808
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:51,450
country and then you have a separate

809
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:55,130
model which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm think of more as</font>

810
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:58,799
a federated model which is indeed<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

811
00:41:55,130 --> 00:42:00,180
administrative division between logical

812
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,830
entities which one<font color="#CCCCCC"> selves can be</font>

813
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:05,850
distributed them and that's generally

814
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:11,819
doesn't have to be a single so logical

815
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:14,339
SQL<font color="#CCCCCC"> Server I and where I actually can't</font>

816
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:16,980
just go logically like I can do to DHT

817
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:20,040
where I can go to any node and say give

818
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:22,860
me that mapping and it will do its thing

819
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:25,890
by just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to HT mechanics here I would</font>

820
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:28,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to say all this is a canadian phone</font>

821
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:30,930
number so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to the canadian</font>

822
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:33,780
server based on some other look up or

823
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:38,160
based on the identifier prefix in this

824
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:40,559
case I area<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cutlass hunter</font>

825
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">ode and Reuben so I think it's helpful</font>

826
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:45,690
to distinguish those two models simply

827
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:48,150
because they have different implications

828
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:50,520
in terms of the mechanics of looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

829
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:53,250
things in one case the underlying system

830
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:56,460
does at all for you is block chains and

831
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:58,140
dhts and what have you do that or the

832
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,760
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> models that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented in</font>

833
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:02,819
one of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> early prototypes which all</font>

834
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:06,119
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus plain replication in that</font>

835
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:08,190
case and the second point that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

836
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:12,690
thickness come up indirectly in both

837
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:15,270
presentations is I believe it would be

838
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:19,410
extremely helpful to think early on as

839
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:24,420
to who can associate data with a record

840
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:26,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">a burn and the original provisional I so</font>

841
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:30,660
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like say I have a comcast</font>

842
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:33,899
moisture base but as a subscriber and

843
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:35,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to attach say a certificate a</font>

844
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,010
better business bureau certificate to it

845
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">Comcast isn't involved with that at all</font>

846
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:42,390
button somebody's or in video relay

847
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:44,700
service<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a one of a complete</font>

848
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:47,009
example we have is prominent we need to

849
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:49,770
run a two layer database essentially

850
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:51,960
because we have a service provider that

851
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:54,538
provides telecommunication services and

852
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,539
we have a real a provider that provides

853
00:43:54,539 --> 00:44:00,960
relay services in that so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is two</font>

854
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:03,420
level database I which works but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it more</font>

855
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,910
complex probably of all know needs to be

856
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:08,670
i'm exporting harder all of these

857
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:14,629
telephones yeah so if one could

858
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:17,520
associate I different identifiers

859
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:20,940
without that maybe you'll pick to the

860
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:23,250
entity<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I can when somebody can</font>

861
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,950
actually essentially have parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

862
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:29,579
database record that I can add to as a

863
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:32,490
subscriber for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> that allows me to</font>

864
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:35,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">add information to bout that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

865
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:36,868
completely irrelevant the provider

866
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,690
doesn't the service provider doesn't

867
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:42,569
care I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would make sure adding</font>

868
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:44,609
functionality to two databases much

869
00:44:42,569 --> 00:44:47,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">simple it is today because today even</font>

870
00:44:44,609 --> 00:44:49,540
adding a single field<font color="#E5E5E5"> is literally a</font>

871
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:53,770
federal procurement action

872
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:57,910
lancia process and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it is it makes</font>

873
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:59,830
adding features two numbers hurdle is

874
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:02,710
extremely high which means most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it</font>

875
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:04,720
gets huge door never get done yeah so

876
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:06,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">just because Oh Terry does have the</font>

877
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,169
concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there can be multiple</font>

878
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,850
cottage the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> number and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

879
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:11,380
this stuff actually falls out from that

880
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:14,710
in other words when you so when you're

881
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:16,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing a retrieval operation the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nature</font>

882
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:18,460
of your query<font color="#E5E5E5"> will well you know perhaps</font>

883
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:21,100
limit the number of records that you'll

884
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:22,480
get back but there could be subscribers

885
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,950
who provision records against<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

886
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,930
there could be serviced runners to do it

887
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:27,460
there could be all and so in necessarily

888
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:29,290
all have different signatures like

889
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,760
there's different scopes<font color="#E5E5E5"> authority so</font>

890
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:32,500
mean Terry is built on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

891
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,350
pluralistic concept i think that there's

892
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:37,270
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be anybody who has some</font>

893
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:39,370
authority over a number and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

894
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:40,960
about how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too fine but</font>

895
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:42,580
can can provision these records and

896
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,230
really it's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the retrieving entity</font>

897
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:46,240
whether they trust the credentials that

898
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:47,590
were used to attest them if they do then

899
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,850
they use the records and thought they

900
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:51,790
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gives everything</font>

901
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:53,589
you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted from that yeah i was</font>

902
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:58,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">just going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to this chris one that i was</font>

903
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:59,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">just going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the point of drip and</font>

904
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:03,670
I think distributed systems in general

905
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:06,280
the ideas that you want both as a

906
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:09,850
consumer<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from other folks</font>

907
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:11,770
and the the initiator of information

908
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:14,200
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the system you want a</font>

909
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:18,940
complete view of the system so like even

910
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:21,669
if so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the example you know if</font>

911
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:24,070
you do have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canadian registry and a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> US</font>

912
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:25,630
registry I probably want read access on

913
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:28,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Canadian registry that can exist</font>

914
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:30,250
separately but I still want an

915
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:32,050
up-to-date copy because I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to route</font>

916
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:36,000
my telephone calls to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right place as</font>

917
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:39,130
soon as you know Shaw influenza<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

918
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,530
takes hold of a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and allocates</font>

919
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:45,130
it to a customer so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the idea of</font>

920
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:50,200
replication and distribution is sort of

921
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:51,760
a necessary condition at least in the

922
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:54,819
ecosystem where you're both reading and

923
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,920
writing and managing data but I think it

924
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:58,180
also you know again that this lets us

925
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,650
treat the service is something that

926
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:01,029
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be run by comcast could be run by</font>

927
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,500
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you could find these</font>

928
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:02,920
records like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a bus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> station right and</font>

929
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,359
copy them

930
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,619
your computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and still trust them again</font>

931
00:47:04,359 --> 00:47:07,000
provided you trust the authority that

932
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:09,040
generated them you have the cryptograph

933
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,930
insurance of them that lets this apply

934
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,058
equally well to a very distributed model

935
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:14,649
like that as to one where it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

936
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:16,540
the service provider you go to where I

937
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:18,700
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to go to AT&T and ask for</font>

938
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:20,440
this so Terry is designed to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

939
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:24,848
either of those extremes that's one of

940
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:27,700
the constraints<font color="#E5E5E5"> the model next up um so</font>

941
00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:29,349
yeah basically all these operations

942
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:31,118
break down to a variety<font color="#E5E5E5"> of requests and</font>

943
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:33,069
responses and these are what my little

944
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,450
toy draft trying to show what requests

945
00:47:33,069 --> 00:47:36,640
and responses might look like for some

946
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:39,430
of these operations is intended to make

947
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">a bit more substantial this is where we</font>

948
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:43,299
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> begin to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see the questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

949
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:45,819
the alignment is between<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work and</font>

950
00:47:43,299 --> 00:47:47,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">chris's work like for example as we</font>

951
00:47:45,819 --> 00:47:49,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the request you know all</font>

952
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:50,559
requests<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a source allah quest come</font>

953
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,419
from someone there's some administrative

954
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:55,450
identity upon the originator of the

955
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:56,980
query and that may determine where the

956
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,390
great lands<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some cases that may</font>

957
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:00,220
determine whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they who is</font>

958
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:01,868
authorized in some cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has a</font>

959
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:04,750
subject there's there some specific

960
00:48:01,869 --> 00:48:06,609
resource you're asking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

961
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:08,589
this probably fits in with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a public ID</font>

962
00:48:06,609 --> 00:48:11,259
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're describing for the most part</font>

963
00:48:08,589 --> 00:48:12,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">press attributes that are assistive at</font>

964
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:15,099
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> terry request can include things</font>

965
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:17,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a service discriminator VoIP is</font>

966
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:21,490
given as an example of an attribute in

967
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:22,930
terry drafts today and this will

968
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:25,629
ultimately yield response responsible

969
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:26,919
response code and this could just be

970
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:28,630
things like success if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

provisioning a record or failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking for records associated</font>

974
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,059

<font color="#CCCCCC">associated with it the subject has not</font>

yet been allocated say or responses<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

977
00:48:40,329 --> 00:48:43,900
contain records in some cases

978
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:45,670
provisioning requests can contain

979
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,349
records it's really again the record is

980
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:49,630
the fundamental building<font color="#E5E5E5"> block of this</font>

981
00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:51,099
records can cover range the TNS they can

00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:53,200
cover identifiers other than tiens

983
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:57,819
records are very kind of broad in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

985
00:48:57,819 --> 00:49:00,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is where we can kind of look at</font>

986
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:02,650
what the elements were that you were

987
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,160
identifying and say okay or we roughly

988
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:10,270
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you know at least a</font>

989
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:12,790
ballpark for this in the subject of this

990
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:15,009
you see you know I was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this is</font>

991
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:16,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a very rough sketch that I'm</font>

992
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:18,339
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use to just</font>

993
00:49:16,839 --> 00:49:20,140
make this a bit more concrete than the

994
00:49:18,339 --> 00:49:22,089
just endless list of attributes which

995
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,019
are what is in the draft day the subject

996
00:49:22,089 --> 00:49:24,670
field you can see a service

997
00:49:23,019 --> 00:49:26,890
discriminator that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tea that you</font>

998
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:29,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">see for TN right before the telephone</font>

999
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:30,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">number the attribute here indicates</font>

1000
00:49:29,589 --> 00:49:32,578
you're looking for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific service</font>

1001
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:35,079
that service is SMS so this is a

1002
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:37,839
discriminated request or SMS associated

1003
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:39,670
with that telephone number and it does

1004
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:41,049
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this request source in it and this</font>

1005
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:42,339
instance this gives you a logical

1006
00:49:41,049 --> 00:49:45,009
identity of who the request is coming

1007
00:49:42,339 --> 00:49:46,630
from obviously doing some kind of

1008
00:49:45,009 --> 00:49:49,059
cryptographic thing for that could make

1009
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:50,259
sense in some contexts in other contexts

1010
00:49:49,059 --> 00:49:51,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">they'll be clear if you're using</font>

1011
00:49:50,259 --> 00:49:54,099
actually rest to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

1012
00:49:51,759 --> 00:49:55,359
obviously there are HTTP level

1013
00:49:54,099 --> 00:49:56,859
mechanisms we could lie on Twitter

1014
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:59,200
indicate the source of the query and

1015
00:49:56,859 --> 00:50:01,719
similarly probably we would be encoding

1016
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,460
in the URL itself a lot of the subject

1017
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:05,469
information that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would just be mirrored</font>

1018
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,329
in a restful api between what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see in</font>

1019
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:10,839
subject here and what would go into the

1020
00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:11,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">URI itself but I mean overall this</font>

1021
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:14,078
looking at the kinds of things you're

1022
00:50:11,859 --> 00:50:15,640
talking about anything were obviously we

1023
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,200
have a lot of overlap in terms of you

1024
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,759
know what was already kind of in

1025
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,930
baseline Terry hopes in your model

1026
00:50:18,759 --> 00:50:25,089
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> lime um yeah we have some</font>

1027
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:26,200
responses defined in Terry I haven't

1028
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:27,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">really gone to the trouble of creating</font>

1029
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,890
like response codes yet or anything like

1030
00:50:27,999 --> 00:50:32,229
that obviously one would it were

1031
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:33,910
bringing this forward though again those

1032
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:36,968
two would probably have some mapping to

1033
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:40,089
base HP codes for restful api for a lot

1034
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:41,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these cases here is a example of</font>

1035
00:50:40,089 --> 00:50:42,999
where the source of their quest would

1036
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:47,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">not be authorized</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd get back a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1037
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:49,779
simple record<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this form next long</font>

1038
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:51,910
yeah in terms of what goes into a record

1039
00:50:49,779 --> 00:50:53,920
this too is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think this may be a place</font>

1040
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:55,118
<font color="#CCCCCC">where we're architectural II I'm may be</font>

1041
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,619
thinking a little bit differently than

1042
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:59,140
your model is I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1043
00:50:56,619 --> 00:51:00,609
the API whereas I'm more focused on the

1044
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,920
notion<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's this object right</font>

1045
00:51:00,609 --> 00:51:05,200
that lives in use databases and the

1046
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:07,420
purpose of the API is simply to operate

1047
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,098
on that record because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd architectural</font>

1048
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:10,269
II think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it that way I'm most</font>

1049
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:12,729
concerned about what goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1050
00:51:10,269 --> 00:51:15,189
record itself and so a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the Terry</font>

1051
00:51:12,729 --> 00:51:17,680
discussion is about how you populate it

1052
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:22,630
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what kinds of things like</font>

1053
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:24,009
in it but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is this is I</font>

1054
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:25,869
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going through most of</font>

1055
00:51:24,009 --> 00:51:27,640
this before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the entities as well</font>

1056
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:29,140
in the modern framework line up pretty

1057
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,730
well with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entities</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font>

1058
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:34,420
identifying and

1059
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:36,070
the registry identity model but a

1060
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:38,890
concrete example might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be helpful next</font>

1061
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:40,540
slide so here's me trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a</font>

1062
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:42,460
success response to show what it might

1063
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:44,710
look like to have put in a query and

1064
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:46,600
actually getting a record in return from

1065
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:48,780
that so as you see all these records

1066
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:51,190
have like some kind of a UID in them

1067
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:53,170
they all have an authority in the next

1068
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:54,820
five you just as unsurprisingly the out

1069
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:57,460
registry identity was we're both

1070
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:59,440
thinking that from from stir necessarily

1071
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:01,890
a signature that<font color="#E5E5E5"> accompanies that and</font>

1072
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:05,170
again the<font color="#E5E5E5"> combination of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that authority</font>

1073
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:07,509
in some cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe the contact and the</font>

1074
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:08,619
signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> lets you know who it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

1075
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:11,080
you're trusting when you're trusting

1076
00:52:08,619 --> 00:52:12,400
this record<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is fundamental to</font>

1077
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,750
the way we look at Terry again you could

1078
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,609
find one of these on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Florida bus</font>

1079
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:16,720
station it's fine provide the signature

1080
00:52:15,609 --> 00:52:18,790
checks out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you trust the trust</font>

1081
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,399
anchor that is responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for creating</font>

1082
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:23,350
the record in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this instance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the payload</font>

1083
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:26,770
here is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that service feel that has</font>

1084
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:29,200
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> URI and it's a sip burada you got from</font>

1085
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:31,090
that obviously there can be all kinds of

1086
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,680
attributes and discriminators that are

1087
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:34,990
associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that service there can</font>

1088
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:37,240
be a menu of such services in any single

1089
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:39,220
record and to your point<font color="#CCCCCC"> Henning you</font>

1090
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,240
could get a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1091
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:42,040
this there could be one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

1092
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,569
provisioned by a user<font color="#E5E5E5"> that looks like</font>

1093
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and then a very different one this</font>

1094
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:46,600
version by service provider and as they

1095
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:48,040
consumer of these records to hang on

1096
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,020
whom<font color="#E5E5E5"> you trust and why I'm all kinds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1097
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:52,000
services you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reach you can</font>

1098
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:55,600
exercise<font color="#E5E5E5"> the services that are described</font>

1099
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,660
in it as you see fit<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's that's a</font>

1100
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:01,089
basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea right behind behind all this</font>

1101
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:04,359
and kind of basic example of encoding so

1102
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:06,090
click<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next slide is on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Pig already</font>

1103
00:53:04,359 --> 00:53:08,440
talked enough about this next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1104
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:09,700
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked enough about this to keep</font>

1105
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,960
going keep your<font color="#E5E5E5"> line we already went</font>

1106
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:13,000
through what retrieval and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1107
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">are this is what we actually need to</font>

1108
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,310
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the interesting bed</font>

1109
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:20,080
so I took a look at chris's draft and we

1110
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:23,590
had like it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the brief conversation</font>

1111
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:25,330
about this again<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do think most of</font>

1112
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:27,190
these concepts are directly comparable

1113
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:29,529
to things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terry</font>

1114
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:31,180
model today one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i saw actually in</font>

1115
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:32,800
the registry identity draft that we

1116
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:34,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't do in the tree model today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

1117
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:37,270
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is having an allocation</font>

1118
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,040
time stamp associated with the record

1119
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:41,109
that lets you know like when the record

1120
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,609
specifically was created<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1121
00:53:41,109 --> 00:53:44,290
probably a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful feature for</font>

1122
00:53:42,609 --> 00:53:44,680
this to have that could see<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving into</font>

1123
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:46,210
the base

1124
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,009
line of the Terry information model and

1125
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:51,059
until all the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> instances like</font>

1126
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:53,230
this that we would build on top of it

1127
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:55,089
but in terms<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the identities and</font>

1128
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,740
things like that again I we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1129
00:53:55,089 --> 00:53:58,990
like an exact mapping to what you call

1130
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:00,549
service routing and public identities

1131
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:02,680
but I think we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a slightly different</font>

1132
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:06,790
combination of things that end up making

1133
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:08,950
up much of the same semantics clearly we

1134
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:11,410
treat service not in the this is

1135
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:12,939
Facebook's SMS necessarily sense of

1136
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:15,220
we're going to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> new ID or</font>

1137
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:17,440
something for individual providers

1138
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:19,990
instance of a service though of course

1139
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:22,960
pointing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> URI that is a service here</font>

1140
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:25,000
is necessarily pointing to some service

1141
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,800
that is provided by some sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> rider</font>

1142
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">than you know as a consequence I mean I</font>

1143
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:32,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think we kind of get that any way that</font>

1144
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:35,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">we depict the services in a model like</font>

1145
00:54:32,589 --> 00:54:37,690
this so that if the real question is to

1146
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:40,000
what degree the discriminators for the

1147
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:42,069
services things like VoIP or SMS and so

1148
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,440
on are sufficient for that or whether

1149
00:54:42,069 --> 00:54:47,558
you think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to have something</font>

1150
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:51,250
more like<font color="#CCCCCC"> add a uid to designable this</font>

1151
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:52,809
is Comcast's<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait serve as and you know</font>

1152
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:54,640
architectural<font color="#E5E5E5"> I again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's</font>

1153
00:54:52,809 --> 00:54:56,380
six of one half dozen of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other to be</font>

1154
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,598
honest because you do get that

1155
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:00,250
ultimately that URI and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1156
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:02,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell you it's the or I to comcast</font>

1157
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:05,559
service unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think are some reason</font>

1158
00:55:02,589 --> 00:55:07,270
why the inspector of the record would

1159
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:09,490
trigger something that is like some

1160
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:11,740
service logic based on the fact that

1161
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:13,540
it's Comcast's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lloyd book that would not</font>

1162
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:15,129
be obvious from looking at the uri IV so

1163
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:19,290
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tease out of it what you think</font>

1164
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:22,960
the requirement is behind this well

1165
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:29,380
partially it's just the pure routing

1166
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:32,170
until so you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about service</font>

1167
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:34,390
incorporated into the routing ideas I

1168
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:36,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">college the fact one back to actually</font>

1169
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:41,049
enforce its like back 15 to my example

1170
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:43,000
record one more this good yeah yeah so I

1171
00:55:41,049 --> 00:55:46,720
mean you know example.com and the

1172
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,880
service element here is where Comcast's

1173
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:51,368
give a name would go right if is for

1174
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,349
comcast service and so kind of the way

1175
00:55:51,369 --> 00:55:55,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I thought about this you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1176
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:57,220
is an indication of what goes into the

1177
00:55:55,809 --> 00:55:58,460
service fields you or I and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

1178
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:00,560
reference it you'll be

1179
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:02,540
contacting them for X Y or Z there could

1180
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,799
be attributes then that are further

1181
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:05,359
associated with this and I showed this

1182
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:08,390
in the query they would say things like

1183
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:10,670
VoIP or SMS right so you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> say this</font>

1184
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:13,759
specific you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will have these</font>

1185
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:15,200
attributes associated with it but all

1186
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,619
you need to know to figure out that this

1187
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:20,270
is Comcast's VoIP service is to see that

1188
00:56:17,619 --> 00:56:21,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">example.com there says comcast done that</font>

1189
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:24,440
right and that the attribute associate

1190
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:26,660
with it is white and so I mean this one

1191
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:30,290
asking is there some road I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

1192
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:37,420
a uuid for the service beyond just like

1193
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:39,890
wipe no no you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use that directly I</font>

1194
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:42,140
think I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I was advocating for</font>

1195
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:44,060
uuid it is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought the thoughts</font>

1196
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:45,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">are globally unique identifier and not a</font>

1197
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:47,630
silly uuid like globally unique

1198
00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:48,859
identifier for the services and but you

1199
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:50,359
kind of kind of said you wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1200
00:56:48,859 --> 00:56:52,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">it both ways or that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could either be</font>

1201
00:56:50,359 --> 00:56:55,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">very generic right now actually we</font>

1202
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:59,060
specifically use you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know some textual</font>

1203
00:56:55,550 --> 00:57:00,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay dislike thing yeah and when you do</font>

1204
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,509
that for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple reasons one is you</font>

1205
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:05,509
know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a routing point of view it</font>

1206
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:07,490
it's more explicitly says where you want

1207
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:09,260
to go we also use it from a logging

1208
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:11,149
point of view so if you're doing things

1209
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:16,550
in one application versus another with

1210
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:18,950
the same identity you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one</font>

1211
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:21,470
other concepts i can bring up that we

1212
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:24,460
have which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily related</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1213
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:29,089
that but is something interesting I just

1214
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:31,550
remembered it is for our routing IDs we

1215
00:57:29,089 --> 00:57:36,200
actually use<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you IDs as the user</font>

1216
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:43,180
part and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to avoid any leaking of</font>

1217
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:43,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">PPI data in any of our signaling or</font>

1218
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:49,820
logging systems or other things so

1219
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:52,220
that's the sort of another orthogonal

1220
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:56,000
concept to think about that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1221
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:58,959
mentioned but from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the domain part of</font>

1222
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:03,500
the routing ID yeah I mean I think it's

1223
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:06,800
nice to have the explicit domain and

1224
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:11,200
service association they're just so you

1225
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:13,930
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly where it's going to answer</font>

1226
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,640
because ultimately I want to if I want

1227
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:18,730
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send a call if I want to send a VoIP</font>

1228
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:23,560
call to<font color="#CCCCCC"> two one five five five five one</font>

1229
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:26,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">two one two I need those two pieces of</font>

1230
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:30,369
information to get the global unique

1231
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:32,650
routing address or you are I that I'm

1232
00:58:30,369 --> 00:58:36,579
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send it to and why not include</font>

1233
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:38,760
those explicitly in the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the URI</font>

1234
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:42,820
that's used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually route it yep</font>

1235
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:44,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">that Philly make sense yeah I mean I</font>

1236
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:49,839
guess they could put that for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris</font>

1237
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:52,119
comparison slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks um I mean I get</font>

1238
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:53,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mike I guess I'm confident from our</font>

1239
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:55,270
initial look at this any way that we

1240
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:57,460
could probably converge pretty quickly

1241
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:58,990
on what we think the necessary fields

1242
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:02,230
are to cover the identities in this

1243
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:04,060
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well for kind of the</font>

1244
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:06,010
provider subscribe or distinction

1245
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:07,630
against and Terry doesn't doesn't draw

1246
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:10,300
that this to explicitly just as there's

1247
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:12,040
a contact right and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the contact for</font>

1248
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:15,040
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> record could be a service provider</font>

1249
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:17,140
it could be a user the point being it's

1250
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,490
ultimately the authority of designer

1251
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:20,770
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> determines whether not you trust</font>

1252
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:22,990
them and so we look at that I guess a

1253
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:26,980
higher level in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that Carrie is</font>

1254
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:29,560
oriented the allocation times timestamp

1255
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:31,270
I definitely want and from the operation

1256
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,828
perspective again the operations and

1257
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:34,270
Terry were designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do all sorts of</font>

1258
00:59:32,829 --> 00:59:36,550
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do with telephone number so</font>

1259
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:39,339
unsurprisingly things like porting and

1260
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:41,589
and so on or entirely what what it's all

1261
00:59:39,339 --> 00:59:42,730
about yeah yeah I guess I was just

1262
00:59:41,589 --> 00:59:44,380
thinking back to the me I mean

1263
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:47,040
theoretically it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1264
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:50,200
anything right like as long as it's um

1265
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:52,540
there's a way to route it oh yeah yeah

1266
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:55,210
you know it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> XYZ if it as long</font>

1267
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:59,349
as this was provider understands where

1268
00:59:55,210 --> 01:00:01,599
it's going to and well again is what yes

1269
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:04,000
as long as the entity that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets</font>

1270
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:07,630
routed to but you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the domain</font>

1271
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,250
then that provides less indication or

1272
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:11,920
you could always incorporate it in the

1273
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:13,450
user part<font color="#E5E5E5"> two there's lots of I think</font>

1274
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,339
we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking convention here it is</font>

1275
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:16,450
its syntax I think that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

1276
01:00:15,339 --> 01:00:17,589
order we all agree on what the

1277
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:19,240
information is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that each of you convey</font>

1278
01:00:17,589 --> 01:00:21,040
the question is just like weird yet

1279
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,680
stick at right maybe you stick it into

1280
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,009
the domain name itself it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> voice</font>

1281
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:26,290
comcast.net

1282
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:27,670
or if there is you know comcast.net and

1283
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:29,770
then there's an attribute field next to

1284
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:32,800
it that has like<font color="#E5E5E5"> boy it right so this is</font>

1285
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:36,130
merely syntactic right convention I mean

1286
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:37,420
an interesting component of doing it the

1287
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:38,830
way that I'm describing is that you can

1288
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:41,170
have multiple attributes associated with

1289
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:44,470
that say so if you have this address

1290
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:46,090
supports voice and video and SMS you

1291
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:47,680
could then<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the CRI with three</font>

1292
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:49,720
attributes associated with it and say

1293
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,700
that services<font color="#E5E5E5"> I support our void video</font>

1294
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:53,669
and SMS whereas if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're encoding the</font>

1295
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:57,189
domain name and that's like VoIP

1296
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:58,450
comcast.net um you know you wanted how

1297
01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:03,040
do you wanna do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that joined you voice</font>

1298
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:07,210
SMS video comcast.net where can you show

1299
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:09,040
how that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be represented should go</font>

1300
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:11,800
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the query I think the fury shows</font>

1301
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:13,390
that yeah so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at the</font>

1302
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,500
query the query I just put it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1303
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:15,759
attribute field into everett that has

1304
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:18,100
service associated with thats just

1305
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,660
imagine that service you know these are

1306
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:21,970
arrays right you just specify multiple

1307
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:23,140
services that are associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

1308
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:26,439
telephone<font color="#CCCCCC"> number with the subject in</font>

1309
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:28,029
question so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean the the distinct you</font>

1310
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:30,190
imagine after we feel just like that

1311
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:32,830
gets in the record and is attached to

1312
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:34,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">the service</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uri and that's something</font>

1313
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:37,120
that's in Terry but isn't in the example

1314
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:38,710
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing up the Terry record and</font>

1315
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,720
again the alternative would be though if

1316
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:42,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">we literally were encoding these service</font>

1317
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:45,490
identifiers into the domain names I

1318
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:47,770
think it gets syntactically you know

1319
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:53,080
gnarly to show multiple services

1320
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:54,160
associated with the same resource we can

1321
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:56,319
take this offline to an hour and<font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font>

1322
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:58,000
you a favor using separate records i

1323
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:00,730
think but<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's no possibility</font>

1324
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,730
sure um so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

1325
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:05,560
confused here like you have service<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

1326
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:07,630
but in the record service<font color="#CCCCCC"> is associated</font>

1327
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:09,730
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URI but this is a query there's</font>

1328
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:13,240
no record here yeah yes so queries have

1329
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:15,790
their own understand that but are you

1330
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:18,970
implying that so what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mapping</font>

1331
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:21,220
from service of SMS to the record it's a

1332
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:23,200
discriminator of records that you want

1333
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:25,600
to be retrieved so in other words this

1334
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,919
this you're putting a limit saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1335
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:30,310
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in records that don't</font>

1336
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:31,720
have this quality so if you have a VoIP

1337
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:33,070
record anyone see it because the

1338
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:36,029
attribute I'm looking for in this query

1339
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:36,030
is just the SMS

1340
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:42,480
henning I take what we were somewhat

1341
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:44,609
dancing around and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this goes back to</font>

1342
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,820
your relational model question that I

1343
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:51,540
asked earlier in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your terms of response</font>

1344
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:54,480
also in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my uniqueness and</font>

1345
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:57,870
records you mean what are in database

1346
01:02:54,480 --> 01:03:01,110
terminology what a primary keys and what

1347
01:02:57,870 --> 01:03:03,029
not who took keys and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> queries to</font>

1348
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:06,350
you support and why do you support exact

1349
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:09,000
match queries only or do you support

1350
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:11,160
boolean type of queries predicates step

1351
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,920
of queries or you support wild cut

1352
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:15,930
queries I mean all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these are</font>

1353
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:17,940
fundamentally what we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

1354
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:20,970
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the reason that</font>

1355
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:24,150
we've had trouble what if enum is not

1356
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:28,919
just that sticking information and DNS

1357
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:31,860
is kludgy at best I if it's not intended

1358
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:36,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">from particular I for that and that the</font>

1359
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:39,210
query model is by nature be limited it's

1360
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:42,089
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult outside a single</font>

1361
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:44,820
domain to do you know asians and other

1362
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:46,920
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might like to do so I</font>

1363
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:50,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">wonder if we shouldn't think of is it a</font>

1364
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:53,790
little differently namely that we

1365
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:58,710
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a primary key being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> please</font>

1366
01:03:53,790 --> 01:04:01,520
things not to namely global identify a

1367
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:05,820
telephone number now a case a service ID

1368
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:08,310
SMS and your example and a third

1369
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:10,320
randomly assigned thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> normally</font>

1370
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:13,320
don't query for but allows me to have

1371
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:16,080
multiple entities so for example again

1372
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:18,990
think of the video<font color="#E5E5E5"> relay service example</font>

1373
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:22,230
I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a telephone number which</font>

1374
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:26,549
said tells me that the provider for that

1375
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:28,740
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a KO that gets the trunk tube video a</font>

1376
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:31,320
service provider and I have a second

1377
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:33,029
entry which tells me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the video</font>

1378
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:35,430
relay service provider that provides the

1379
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:38,790
upper layer service application layer

1380
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:41,460
service if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want is whoever van</font>

1381
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:44,759
company not related to that and

1382
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:46,260
similarly i can think of attaching the

1383
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:48,740
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of better business by crude</font>

1384
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:51,410
whatever else<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whoo</font>

1385
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:53,600
to overseeing service you have certified

1386
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:56,149
they only a test to a fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1387
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:59,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">my voice number actually kind of a TV</font>

1388
01:04:56,150 --> 01:05:02,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">version of a certificate in that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1389
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:05,780
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> and secondly that's so I don't</font>

1390
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:09,170
think that's how on to do technically

1391
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:12,830
but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> well into your model the harder</font>

1392
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:15,440
question which changes what particularly

1393
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:18,830
federated model what you really want to

1394
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:21,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">do is do wow you get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a wild carding</font>

1395
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:26,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece or actual queries that are not</font>

1396
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:28,670
simple give me Eva all subject related

1397
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:33,259
records by removing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attribute field</font>

1398
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:37,850
I but is clearly just simply a an query

1399
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:39,740
of I exact matches which is what you

1400
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:41,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">have here currently employed and I think</font>

1401
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:44,080
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is true for both proposals if I</font>

1402
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:46,580
understood correctly so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

1403
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:49,130
discussion needs to be had early on

1404
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:52,009
because it affects what dhts don't work

1405
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:54,380
very well for example wave sql-like

1406
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:57,680
queries yeah just doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

1407
01:05:54,380 --> 01:06:00,080
compute literally I but they've worked

1408
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:02,810
just fine or application months and on a

1409
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:04,910
big problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have espero of semantics</font>

1410
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:09,440
or LDAP semantics if you want to take

1411
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:11,000
something closer to home yep I let Alex

1412
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,980
talk about you can talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> luck and</font>

1413
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,990
earth sabah sleep at all but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that looks</font>

1414
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:16,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">me over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can share some of the horror</font>

1415
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:20,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">stories of drinks that you have watching</font>

1416
01:06:16,850 --> 01:06:22,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">originals day I hope anyways what was</font>

1417
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:25,670
the significant struggle was the

1418
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:28,790
difference between being able to query

1419
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:31,040
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> range being able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> query for an on</font>

1420
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:33,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">the guy take range that's the correct</font>

1421
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:35,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">board you know what I mean and all kind</font>

1422
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:39,590
of weirds collections like variable

1423
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:43,090
number links so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> depending on</font>

1424
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:45,410
what you said you need to figure or

1425
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:47,240
decide at some point where it's just the

1426
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:52,160
exact number or whether it's essentially

1427
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:56,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">a supporting is several types of queries</font>

1428
01:06:52,160 --> 01:07:00,080
for several collections of public

1429
01:06:56,030 --> 01:07:01,609
entities our public identities so well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1430
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,690
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think at least I've been looking</font>

1431
01:07:01,609 --> 01:07:05,359
at like I do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have something</font>

1432
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:07,339
like a search function i mean i'd say

1433
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:09,200
that the way that we would instantiate

1434
01:07:07,339 --> 01:07:11,180
that search function in a restful api

1435
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:13,490
you know what looked like you know that

1436
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:14,990
you you would say give me the data

1437
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:16,729
structure<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all the things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meet</font>

1438
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:17,899
the phone search criteria<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so what we</font>

1439
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:19,339
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be almost as well like right</font>

1440
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:21,500
you've interrogated a service and it

1441
01:07:19,339 --> 01:07:23,150
would perform some you know hamster

1442
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:25,819
wheel function in the back and you know

1443
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:27,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">min to response for you um which is a</font>

1444
01:07:25,819 --> 01:07:29,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">very different matter i think then</font>

1445
01:07:27,609 --> 01:07:31,640
interrogating for things that are likely

1446
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:33,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">to yield records i think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font>

1447
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:35,509
be yielding a collection of pointers to

1448
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,650
records rather than a record itself now

1449
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:38,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how i've seen the search</font>

1450
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:42,079
function is being different from this

1451
01:07:38,869 --> 01:07:43,700
specific query function no i said<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font>

1452
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:45,079
we've only really sketched this like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1453
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:46,129
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean we're we're still trying to</font>

1454
01:07:45,079 --> 01:07:47,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">figure out if we've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the data model</font>

1455
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:49,220
right and this is like I think the first

1456
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:51,410
real proof of it that we're exploring

1457
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:53,118
now but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it is possible to do</font>

1458
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:54,290
search you just need to look at search

1459
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:56,089
like something very different from the

1460
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:57,619
other functions and I think we're

1461
01:07:56,089 --> 01:07:58,970
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the limitations the DNS you</font>

1462
01:07:57,619 --> 01:08:01,280
just can't do that with something like

1463
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:03,049
the DNS but you can like a restful api

1464
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,190
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean you're good to say like</font>

1465
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:05,359
give me the pointers for all the records

1466
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:08,540
or associate with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you'll get back a</font>

1467
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:10,490
JSON structure has a mole am I think

1468
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:12,619
that the important use case in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

1469
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:14,868
is the I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you still remember the</font>

1470
01:08:12,619 --> 01:08:16,759
weird European way to route numbers so

1471
01:08:14,869 --> 01:08:18,560
they I located in blocks to search for

1472
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:21,259
editors and the numbers ported out it's

1473
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:24,620
actually being hope I hope routing so

1474
01:08:21,259 --> 01:08:26,299
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> series arthritis Rob</font>

1475
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:28,299
directly and the others routed to the

1476
01:08:26,299 --> 01:08:30,830
blog owner and the block owner<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1477
01:08:28,299 --> 01:08:32,060
obligated folded t or dead end so the

1478
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:34,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is whether the protocol would</font>

1479
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:38,150
actually sort of do the hamster wheel

1480
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:41,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">seeing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a behind to like give an entity</font>

1481
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:43,698
that director destination or it would

1482
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:45,199
like return both information like okay

1483
01:08:43,698 --> 01:08:47,929
the blocks going there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then little</font>

1484
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:50,660
number there so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like zombies from</font>

1485
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:53,270
the past yeah yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gone and</font>

1486
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:54,979
and and I get a mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this</font>

1487
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:57,920
also goes back to our point about what

1488
01:08:54,979 --> 01:08:59,988
what's the job of the actual like it

1489
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">said as opposed to this lookup function</font>

1490
01:08:59,988 --> 01:09:03,198
right in unfortunately there there is

1491
01:09:01,939 --> 01:09:04,099
going to be a lookup phase and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1492
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:06,500
eventually you're going through a call

1493
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:07,609
over the wall and even if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

1494
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:09,620
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right Roger it gets to be</font>

1495
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:11,270
forward it right i mean it's we're never

1496
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:12,769
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to totally like you</font>

1497
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:14,380
know mitigate that but i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the the</font>

1498
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:16,609
truth<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the matter is i can imagine</font>

1499
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:18,739
very delicate of

1500
01:09:16,609 --> 01:09:20,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">to this where you know you go to one</font>

1501
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:21,799
service<font color="#CCCCCC"> inquiring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is actually</font>

1502
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:23,779
record for this reside somewhere else

1503
01:09:21,799 --> 01:09:26,028
and you then go and acquire the record

1504
01:09:23,779 --> 01:09:28,040
from them the Terry model is intended to

1505
01:09:26,029 --> 01:09:30,020
be completely agnostic to those<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of</font>

1506
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:31,969
architectural questions again this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1507
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:33,440
something you simply can't do with the

1508
01:09:31,969 --> 01:09:35,359
hierarchy of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS right and that's</font>

1509
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:38,719
like one of the reasons why this is a

1510
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:40,580
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more interesting model yeah it's</font>

1511
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:41,839
just a question whether that so what

1512
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:43,399
you're saying is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the model actually</font>

1513
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:44,750
would allow for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hamster wheeling to</font>

1514
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:52,519
happen post on the server side and

1515
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:54,530
folsom a factoid it would yeah okay I'm

1516
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:55,850
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out on that so when</font>

1517
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:57,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things are provisioned i'm under</font>

1518
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:59,780
the very patient also in ranges

1519
01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:01,519
sometimes right and a signatures occur

1520
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:03,769
at provisioning time not when the record

1521
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:06,350
returned those like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

1522
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:08,150
range of things i might get like a

1523
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:09,710
handful of objects<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are like those</font>

1524
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:11,089
ranges plus other stuff and their

1525
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:12,320
signatures and all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and then it's</font>

1526
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:14,480
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me as a client to kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of window</font>

1527
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,040
that down to what I care about yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1528
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:17,780
now they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> there they're your crew</font>

1529
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:19,130
intermediaries I have them as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ND in</font>

1530
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:21,170
this they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually allowed to perform</font>

1531
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:23,810
weird functions that for certain

1532
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:26,300
environments would whittle it down for

1533
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:27,469
you but right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would eat like</font>

1534
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:32,270
Reese<font color="#CCCCCC"> ein it was something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

1535
01:10:27,469 --> 01:10:35,780
trust<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay guess so Henning speaking and</font>

1536
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:38,090
I i do believe given the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns experience</font>

1537
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:40,340
and other things but we've tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my</font>

1538
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:44,810
new little while cutting here a little

1539
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:48,020
bit of and then we a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of wag</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font>

1540

<font color="#E5E5E5">tear to take some of 18 I'm example it's</font>

1541
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:53,300
all about you know you get almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1542
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:56,989
the complexity but you never get quite

1543
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:59,840
the generality that you really wanted so

1544
01:10:56,989 --> 01:11:02,150
I'm I fully recognize a depending on

1545
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:04,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">implementation structures that some</font>

1546
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:07,070
implementation will not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1547
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:09,739
the kind of queries that you would want

1548
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:11,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's perfectly fine but if</font>

1549
01:11:09,739 --> 01:11:13,759
you build an instance of at which does

1550
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:16,550
not support because if the choices you

1551
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:19,820
made does not support generalized

1552
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:22,480
predicate queries good mine that's just

1553
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:24,920
hopefully you made that decision I

1554
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:29,540
knowing what you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself or not</font>

1555
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:30,090
yeah I but I I would advocate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1556
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:31,920
this is

1557
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:35,369
actually what we're building is a

1558
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:38,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">version of evo if you like it it's a no</font>

1559
01:11:35,369 --> 01:11:41,848
sequel tap database or a sequel type

1560
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:46,409
database<font color="#E5E5E5"> whichever why but probably more</font>

1561
01:11:41,849 --> 01:11:48,540
likely a somewhat of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hybrid between</font>

1562
01:11:46,409 --> 01:11:51,000
the two namely in the sense that it has

1563
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:53,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ability to add additional attributes</font>

1564
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:58,730
to that without redesigning the whole

1565
01:11:53,250 --> 01:12:01,830
database without doing a mine I transfer

1566
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:04,320
schema transformation yep because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1567
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:08,849
is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> schema directly except for some</font>

1568
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:12,750
fixed fields yet I also allowing

1569
01:12:08,849 --> 01:12:14,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">predicates style queries because a we</font>

1570
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:18,090
know how to do those in many practical

1571
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:20,879
implementations and bail well understood

1572
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:23,610
in terms of correctness and operations

1573
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,920
we don't have to invent pose we have

1574
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:27,809
some history of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that in el de up</font>

1575
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,639
and actually in the service location

protocol as well which<font color="#CCCCCC"> Weber which is</font>

widely used for any more variety of

01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:39,179
reasons but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know at least how to do</font>

1579
01:12:34,139 --> 01:12:41,760
those I and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> also allows us to do to</font>

1580
01:12:39,179 --> 01:12:43,530
not have to glom on my way the

1581
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,330
alternative basically is you get one

1582
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:47,159
record or you get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> million records and</font>

1583
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:50,010
you go to certainly my good luck sorting

1584
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:52,589
them out at the client side I in that

1585
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:55,320
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically the DNS model you can</font>

1586
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:57,929
do in a except our if you're allowed to

1587
01:12:55,320 --> 01:13:00,030
do that and then you get to inspect the

1588
01:12:57,929 --> 01:13:02,610
database I mean you get to do search

1589
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:05,570
local now one interesting question is I

1590
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:09,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we need to answer separately is</font>

1591
01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:10,920
the permission structure namely one of

1592
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:13,889
the problems as you know from a

1593
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:15,869
telephone database is that not just for

1594
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:18,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">write access for obvious reason but read</font>

1595
01:13:15,869 --> 01:13:21,299
access is fairly closely guarded as well

1596
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:23,428
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> variety of privacy and business</font>

1597
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:25,320
reasons namely I want to be able to

1598
01:13:23,429 --> 01:13:27,239
charge<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that and I don't want people</font>

1599
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:30,769
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> copies of the database</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

1600
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:34,799
sell my data set out for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lower price I</font>

1601
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:37,679
normal so<font color="#CCCCCC"> both of those will likely</font>

1602
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:41,330
persist so I don't have a good answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1603
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:43,980
that but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> suspect there will be a</font>

1604
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:46,440
different answer namely I can see

1605
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:52,589
you that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can i'm allowed to retrieve a</font>

1606
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:57,120
record that is mine I'm and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some way</font>

1607
01:13:52,590 --> 01:14:00,330
right but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not allowed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to query as a</font>

1608
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:03,390
consumer for example for a record that

1609
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:06,450
is when every prefix of 212 area code

1610
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:09,390
and it I that needs to be part of a

1611
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:13,530
model<font color="#E5E5E5"> assumptions how I can express that</font>

1612
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:15,420
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for modification but also for</font>

1613
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:18,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">weeds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't rely exclusively on</font>

1614
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:20,730
encryption I and key materials because

1615
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:23,190
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to work but i don't</font>

1616
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:25,320
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that maps very well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i probably not</font>

1617
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:26,669
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think you're right um so yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1618
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:29,160
definitely think you're right and I

1619
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:31,020
guess I've you know been conveniently

1620
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:32,040
kind of hand waving that the services

1621
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:33,720
themselves will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of that</font>

1622
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:35,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsibility for the architectures</font>

1623
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:37,590
that are relevant in the sense of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1624
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:39,900
ipn and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I write is a closed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network and</font>

1625
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:42,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually set of entities that I've</font>

1626
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:44,549
accessed the ipn and I are prescribed

1627
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:46,620
and you know a service like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1628
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:48,450
existed in that environment would have

1629
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:50,250
that that limitation to it whereas

1630
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:52,050
something like drip say if we imagine

1631
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:53,640
that was more<font color="#E5E5E5"> open and that everyone was</font>

1632
01:14:52,050 --> 01:14:55,140
pushing and pulling numbers from that

1633
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:56,970
and experimenting and doing cool things

1634
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:58,890
that that would have a very different

1635
01:14:56,970 --> 01:15:01,560
quality would want pretty much anybody

1636
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:03,930
to go with query and get a route right

1637
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:06,870
to choose to for a service it can

1638
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:09,270
support either<font color="#CCCCCC"> model</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it on the job</font>

01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:14,250

well the kinds of you our eyes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds</font>

1643
01:15:16,290 --> 01:15:23,190
that is that the routing ID and yours it

1644

1646
01:15:24,570 --> 01:15:28,860
depending on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> preferences of the</font>

creator of The Associated record and a

1649
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:33,750
just like an edge<font color="#CCCCCC"> SPC for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your network</font>

1653
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:40,410
sorry I think there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some knobs</font>

1654
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:42,210
to tweak around that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you're</font>

1655
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:43,650
definitely correct that the acquisition

01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:46,739
interface and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the management interface</font>

1657
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:48,870
need to have some permission system that

1658
01:15:46,739 --> 01:15:50,700
expresses at least what the intention is

1659
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:52,230
if the authority that generated this for

1660
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:54,300
which qui resources should be authorized

1661
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:56,459
and there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some cases well just be</font>

1662
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,660
explicit and implicit and the design of

1663
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:58,830
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system and then</font>

1664
01:15:57,660 --> 01:16:00,630
others where I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll need</font>

1665
01:15:58,830 --> 01:16:02,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm not sure that's</font>

1666
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:03,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">the lowest hanging fruit in terms of</font>

1667
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:04,980
what the kinds of things I'm try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

1668
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:08,269
aligned at this point but I agree we

1669
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:11,129
definitely need it just to address some

1670
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:13,230
block number block issues and things

1671
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:15,810
like that i mean i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> in restful</font>

1672
01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:17,820

1674
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:22,259
explicit in terms of functionality so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1675
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:25,050
think we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have functions</font>

association with each of them and and

1683
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:46,710
and things like that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1684
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:50,100
shouldn't worry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> adding new nouns</font>

01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:51,630
and verbs for<font color="#CCCCCC"> each function I mean</font>

1686
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:54,390
that's typically what you want to do in

1687
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:59,550
terms of accessing a resource in a

1688
01:16:54,390 --> 01:17:01,800
restful system yeah Tim Crocker the

1689
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:03,750
discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> has ranged in a way that</font>

1690
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:06,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">leaves me confused about a kind of core</font>

1691
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:10,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">point and it relates to exactly the</font>

1692
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:12,980
sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that Henning was raising</font>

1693
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:15,630
there's this basic difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

1694
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:18,059
any service but especially a query

1695
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:21,030
service in under a single administrative

1696
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:22,530
control versus multiple so<font color="#E5E5E5"> x500 was</font>

1697
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:24,990
meant to be multiple that didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go so</font>

1698
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:26,790
well ldap besides simplifying the

1699
01:17:24,990 --> 01:17:29,280
technology does work well but that's

1700
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:31,650
under single administrative control is

1701
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:33,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> target here for a single</font>

1702
01:17:31,650 --> 01:17:35,849
administration not talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

1703
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:36,960
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> users there are organizations as</font>

1704
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:38,610
users and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

1705
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:42,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">administrative control of the query</font>

1707
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think that the fundamental distinction</font>

1708
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:48,000
here is between authorities and services

1709
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:50,010
so there's a sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> in which authorities</font>

1710
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:54,630
generate the records and the relying

1711
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:56,790
parties a lot separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> is me da that</font>

1712
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:58,890
gets those two yet right and one one

1713
01:17:56,790 --> 01:18:00,960
could actually do the DNS with I mean

1714
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:04,170
you made the reference for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the slide</font>

1715
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:06,810
yeah and so I was taking this as highly

1716
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:08,360
conceptual and not implementation if in

1717
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:10,260
fact you meant there is a single

1718
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:11,460
administrative entity in charge of the

1719
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:12,930
query service I

1720
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:14,190
the fact that there's different people

1721
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:15,780
feeding into it and different people

1722
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:17,730
pulling from it is is not the

1723
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:21,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting question it's how many are</font>

1724
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:22,650
administering the content in there well

1725
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:23,880
that's the authorities though so we

1726
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:25,349
reimagine authorities could have

1727
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:27,540
relationships with multiple services

1728
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:31,350
they could be so i apologize i misspoke

1729
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:34,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">i meant running the query service itself</font>

1730
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:36,660
do you mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a single controlling</font>

1731
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:37,800
entity for that service module of course

1732
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:40,019
not we've talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it being</font>

1733
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:42,540
distributed federated consolidated or

1734
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:45,150
found on bus station dude and flowing

1735
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:49,110
again yet and the operational examples

1736
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:51,719
that we have to base for doing that well

1737
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:54,150
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bus station floor not much for</font>

1738
01:18:51,719 --> 01:18:55,770
again we have a few proposals here for

1739
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:57,269
ways to do distributed hash tables for

1740
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:58,560
example to move objects like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

1741
01:18:57,270 --> 01:19:00,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">make it point you to other things have</font>

1742
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,100
this property that dunt the<font color="#CCCCCC"> double PhDs</font>

1743
01:19:00,450 --> 01:19:03,599
I can certainly point you to centralized

1744
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:05,700
and federated alternatives for this I

1745
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:08,190
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is practically</font>

1746
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:09,989
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> say in the IP and I today is</font>

1747
01:19:08,190 --> 01:19:12,150
basically federated right you if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1748
01:19:09,989 --> 01:19:14,099
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call comcast you go to comcast</font>

1749
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:15,629
service and you say hey like what you

1750
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:17,430
know I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the cell phone number what</font>

1751
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:19,320
does it end up connecting to that's a

1752
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:20,880
federated approach and all we're doing

1753
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:23,519
here again is trying to get a bit of

1754
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:26,040
architectural commonality around these

1755
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:28,350
records injected into what I think is a

1756
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:30,000
set of familiar services of this forum

1757
01:19:28,350 --> 01:19:32,790
go immediately not the bus station<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1758
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,520
okay we've got about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left</font>

1759
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:37,680
just so just any quick comment on that

1760
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:39,570
is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's useful to distinguish</font>

1761
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:42,270
between two kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of even on the</font>

1762
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:45,420
operation side two kinds of models and

1763
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:48,660
one is an untrusted model which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1764
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:50,400
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> less a federated x500 model where</font>

1765
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:52,380
there's really no notion that these

1766
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:54,210
entities<font color="#E5E5E5"> have understood if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would call</font>

1767
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:55,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">but design correctly all or trust really</font>

1768
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:59,790
didn't play as much of all during those

1769
01:19:55,890 --> 01:20:04,230
early days I had any trust relationship

1770
01:19:59,790 --> 01:20:07,230
with each other at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I and the other</font>

1771
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:11,040
one to ask when to answer a somewhat

1772
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:14,370
vaguely related example is the TV white

1773
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:16,680
spaces database in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the United States we</font>

1774
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:18,120
avail about it does and so not hundreds

1775
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:22,280
not thousands because Trust doesn't

1776
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:24,760
scale that well to that number<font color="#E5E5E5"> I operate</font>

1777
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:27,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">independent but consistent data</font>

1778
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:31,239
basis and they can generally trust each

1779
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:34,690
other meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I put a entry in one</font>

1780
01:20:31,239 --> 01:20:36,638
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will believe that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they should also</font>

1781
01:20:34,690 --> 01:20:38,558
inherit that entity that the other

1782
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:41,820
entity has validated whatever they need

1783
01:20:38,559 --> 01:20:46,150
to do and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> administra</font>

1784
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:49,239
submissively independent I they don't

1785
01:20:46,150 --> 01:20:51,670
share passwords with each other and but

1786
01:20:49,239 --> 01:20:53,980
they have by legal and other

1787
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:57,579
constructions obligated to trust each

1788
01:20:53,980 --> 01:21:00,190
other in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and I suspect that in the</font>

trust model not a technical trust model

1793
01:21:08,289 --> 01:21:14,199
that will essentially said you get to be

1794
01:21:10,539 --> 01:21:15,820
part of a club if you play by rules and

1795
01:21:14,199 --> 01:21:18,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">will kick you out of a club if we are</font>

1796
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:23,889
founding finding you to have I

1797
01:21:18,119 --> 01:21:27,820
deliberately violated those rules just a

1798
01:21:23,889 --> 01:21:30,550
comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the operational side I don't</font>

1799
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:34,780
have good<font color="#CCCCCC"> telkom examples but in the</font>

1800
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:39,880
cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> and container world there's many</font>

1801
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:41,380
services including Google there's that

1802
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:46,929
there's open source examples actually

1803
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:49,630
like at CD uber Nettie's console some

1804
01:21:46,929 --> 01:21:52,869
others that implement in fact drip was

1805
01:21:49,630 --> 01:21:55,659
pretty much essentially made to model

1806
01:21:52,869 --> 01:21:58,750
this we're in the cloud world you're

1807
01:21:55,659 --> 01:22:00,420
managing you know thousands tens of

1808
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:03,550
thousands hundreds of thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1809
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:05,260
containers out there they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going up</font>

1810
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:08,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">and down then you can communicate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> across</font>

1811
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:10,420
multiple sites across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world they</font>

1812
01:22:08,199 --> 01:22:12,400
have distributed registries essentially

1813
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:15,190
based on gossip protocols and things

1814
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:17,339
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that works extremely</font>

1815
01:22:15,190 --> 01:22:22,839
well you know it's obviously running in

1816
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:27,840
very highly highly loaded systems so I

1817
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:31,360
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's 12 particularly point2 I</font>

1818
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:34,599
also wanted to maybe go back to because

1819
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:37,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sort of still reconciling the</font>

1820
01:22:34,599 --> 01:22:43,150
service thing in my head

1821
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:46,059
mental but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think a big</font>

1822
01:22:43,150 --> 01:22:47,589
difference in what I'm putting forward

1823
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:51,910
and what you're putting forward and

1824
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:57,250
maybe we need to intellectually come to

1825
01:22:51,910 --> 01:23:01,929
terms with<font color="#E5E5E5"> is whether or not and correct</font>

1826
01:22:57,250 --> 01:23:04,570
me if I'm wrong a identity like in your

1827
01:23:01,929 --> 01:23:09,850
example here at zip<font color="#CCCCCC"> kool analysis at</font>

1828
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:11,530
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> com should that try to in the</font>

1829
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:15,310
form that it is should that represent

1830
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:17,469
multiple services as an identifier or in

1831
01:23:15,310 --> 01:23:20,530
the model on putting forward as I'm

1832
01:23:17,469 --> 01:23:23,679
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the that is the</font>

1833
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:25,360
identifier that is owned by the either

1834
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:29,199
the provider of the user depending how

1835
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:32,139
you want to look at it and is is how I

1836
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:35,110
reference myself to the world versus how

1837
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:39,460
I actually route calls and messages and

1838
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:40,750
and other things and I think seems to me

1839
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:43,989
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fundamental difference of</font>

1840
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:45,850
where we're at well like I said I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1841
01:23:43,989 --> 01:23:47,589
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we always come up</font>

1842
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:50,500
against when discussions get to this

1843
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:52,390
level is how much we want to give these

1844
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:53,980
kind of directory services that sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1845
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:57,160
front of our real-time communication

1846
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:59,440
systems information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what the</font>

1847
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:01,449
services are that are cut behind the URI

1848
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:03,160
is that r advertising you could look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1849
01:24:01,449 --> 01:24:05,589
this is a multi-stage transformation for

1850
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:06,910
example I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine you started with</font>

1851
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:09,730
a telephone number<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got this back</font>

1852
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:11,830
right and like okay so I got syphilis

1853
01:24:09,730 --> 01:24:13,599
example.com back from the retrieval

1854
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:15,880
operation now I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how</font>

1855
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:17,050
to out that right now we you know we

1856
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,550
interrogate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS these things</font>

1857
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:20,310
ordinarily though practically speaking

1858
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:23,290
not not as much as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we probably should</font>

1859
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:24,969
according to RC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 363 anyway so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

1860
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:27,760
there you could imagine doing another

1861
01:24:24,969 --> 01:24:31,900
Terry query to then get Alice<font color="#E5E5E5"> of example</font>

1862
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:33,790
calm down to Alice at boy example.com I

1863
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:35,769
mean I could also imagine models where

1864
01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:38,410
you get back this and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

1865
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:42,940
several<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these services that represent</font>

1866
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:44,889
different potential male voice<font color="#E5E5E5"> vs video</font>

1867
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:47,500
versus SMS that you get multiple

1868
01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:49,719
wouldn't disagree with and you probably

1869
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:50,550
have your own local routing tables that

1870
01:24:49,719 --> 01:24:53,010
might

1871
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:54,989
now just how we do things today in

1872
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:58,380
service provider world is you know we

1873
01:24:54,989 --> 01:25:00,980
met things to hearing agreements and

1874
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:05,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that SBC destination ingress egress</font>

1875
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:07,678
locations etc so we're not going VoIP

1876
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:09,510
routing directly but we have conversion

1877
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:10,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">tables underneath that that do those</font>

1878
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:14,130
things that doesn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

1879
01:25:10,619 --> 01:25:15,989
couldn't use this directly as a routing

1880
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:19,010
table if we want to get to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font>

1881
01:25:15,989 --> 01:25:21,869
where but it is truly globally routable

1882
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:23,940
well and this this to maybe gets us back

1883
01:25:21,869 --> 01:25:25,739
to and why we're here right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah i'm</font>

1884
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:27,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">glad i've got the appending your today</font>

1885
01:25:25,739 --> 01:25:29,579
since heading was one of the prime

1886
01:25:27,179 --> 01:25:31,170
movers behind us starting to investigate

1887
01:25:29,579 --> 01:25:32,969
you know kind of this isn't necessarily

1888
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:34,469
about what the source<font color="#CCCCCC"> water</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world looks</font>

1889
01:25:32,969 --> 01:25:36,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">like today this has always been this</font>

1890
01:25:34,469 --> 01:25:38,550
speculative exercise right we're trying

1891
01:25:36,510 --> 01:25:41,429
to explore what kinds of resources we

1892
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:43,760
think might be useful to have as number

1893
01:25:41,429 --> 01:25:47,250
administration changes going forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1894
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:48,630
so I mean you know I I think we and we

1895
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:50,489
wanted to work before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1896
01:25:48,630 --> 01:25:52,050
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also want to be able to do you</font>

1897
01:25:50,489 --> 01:25:53,848
know other things that well let me be

1898
01:25:52,050 --> 01:25:55,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">clear I'm not suggesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we only</font>

1899
01:25:53,849 --> 01:25:59,190
support that model I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

1900
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:01,079
can support both models yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font>

1901
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:02,790
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that again i think you know i</font>

1902
01:26:01,079 --> 01:26:04,710
could encode your eyes the way that you

1903
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:06,059
have them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your document in this right</font>

1904
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:08,460
there's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevents that from being</font>

1905
01:26:06,059 --> 01:26:10,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">VoIP example calm and having a booth</font>

1906
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:12,480
attributed so she better whoever us want

1907
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:14,040
to express that syntactically again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1908
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:18,058
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the semantic is</font>

1909
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:21,360
actually different so we were talking

1910
01:26:18,059 --> 01:26:23,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this earlier like again the reason</font>

1911
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:24,179
why whenever we get to this point

1912
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:26,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">architecture like in our genome</font>

1913
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:28,469
discussions<font color="#E5E5E5"> i always get a little cagey</font>

1914
01:26:26,099 --> 01:26:32,460
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of things like how you you</font>

1915
01:26:28,469 --> 01:26:34,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">know let's say that you have sip sip is</font>

1916
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:36,300
a is a one Alou protocol that does

1917
01:26:34,139 --> 01:26:38,010
capability negotiation once you send

1918
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:39,989
someone an invite that contains an offer

1919
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:41,610
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> offerors responded to by an answer</font>

1920
01:26:39,989 --> 01:26:43,530
you use the offer and the answer to

1921
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:44,369
converge to the services<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we share</font>

1922
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:46,559
in common that we're going to

1923
01:26:44,369 --> 01:26:48,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">communicate over if you have something</font>

1924
01:26:46,559 --> 01:26:50,940
it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a void URI does that mean that</font>

1925
01:26:48,389 --> 01:26:53,790
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> both share a video capability like</font>

1926
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:55,469
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> negotiating that like or again</font>

1927
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:57,840
because because the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sip has</font>

1928
01:26:55,469 --> 01:27:01,139
this capability negotiation dimension to

1929
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:03,119
what it does and yeah we can kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1930
01:27:01,139 --> 01:27:04,440
anticipate like this is a service that

1931
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:05,519
is available behind the

1932
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:07,620
but does that mean this is the only

1933
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,360
service that this is and but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1934
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:11,460
are very architectural<font color="#E5E5E5"> II complicated</font>

1935
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:14,040
that's why I get cagey but but couldn't

1936
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:17,250
it be that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Comcast prefers to use VoIP</font>

1937
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:19,410
example.com and a tu prefers to use a

1938
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:23,370
clamp or song and play gonna do their

1939
01:27:19,410 --> 01:27:24,930
internal mapping so yep you know why I

1940
01:27:23,370 --> 01:27:27,090
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> convention either like</font>

1941
01:27:24,930 --> 01:27:28,530
especially in specifications or anything

1942
01:27:27,090 --> 01:27:31,980
sometimes you practically do those

1943
01:27:28,530 --> 01:27:35,340
things for other reasons but seems like

1944
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:37,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's some flexibility to really do</font>

1945
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:41,370
what you want but the model<font color="#CCCCCC"> hospital has</font>

1946
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:43,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">to allow for that I think we're yeah I</font>

1947
01:27:41,370 --> 01:27:45,540
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give a minute to allow for</font>

1948
01:27:43,699 --> 01:27:47,339
logistical change over to the next

1949
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:49,860
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group so I mean I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guess what I'd</font>

1950
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:52,860
say is that it I think we got I think

1951
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:54,989
we're close<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if we go talk about</font>

1952
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:56,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">this we could maybe come back in the</font>

1953
01:27:54,989 --> 01:27:57,570
not-too-distant future with something

1954
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:58,830
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more consolidated from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what's an</font>

1955
01:27:57,570 --> 01:28:00,599
registry identity and what you see in

1956
01:27:58,830 --> 01:28:02,400
this document may be flushes out a bit

1957
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:04,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">more what the RESTful API might look</font>

1958
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:06,120
like that supports this and I hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1959
01:28:04,770 --> 01:28:07,320
people would find this an exciting idea

1960
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:08,699
if anyone thinks is a terrible idea

1961
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:11,429
these would up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us it's terrible</font>

1962
01:28:08,699 --> 01:28:18,419
idea our till the list or don't we're

1963
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:22,020
gonna listen yeah this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

1964
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:24,090
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um just going back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our the</font>

1965
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:27,510
problem statement framework document

1966
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:29,250
could we set a deadline for when the

1967
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:30,690
reviews will come in from our reviewers

1968
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:35,550
that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I does I think a couple</font>

1969
01:28:30,690 --> 01:28:40,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">weeks good enough for ya that's true mr.</font>

1970
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:43,140
a week after Thanksgiving then yeah make

1971
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:49,920
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> three weeks yep so that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be like</font>

1972
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:54,480
just december nine<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks okay good idea</font>

1973
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:55,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks ok well let's adjourn from the</font>

1974
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,910
room as quickly as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible because we</font>

1975
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:59,670
have another working group that starting

1976
01:28:56,910 --> 01:29:01,170
up a real time right away so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1977
01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:03,060
follow on conversations being the

1978
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:08,510
hallway instead of in here thanks

1979

so you have columns against the Kyrian's

1981
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:24,510
things considered<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix it or no I did</font>

1982
01:30:21,130 --> 01:30:24,510
eat Roger not 100 bucks
