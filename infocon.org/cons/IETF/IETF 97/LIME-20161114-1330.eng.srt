00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,679
bad things could happen

31
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,699
ok

32
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:21,169
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the chairs slides um</font>

33
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:23,900
well actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should put up the agenda</font>

34
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:26,900
first well actually the agenda is rather

35
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:29,570
short as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chair slides a update on</font>

36
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,770
the connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> less or documents that an</font>

37
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,169
update on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection oriented</font>

38
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,150
documents so it could could be a very

39
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:38,479
short meeting and then we can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

40
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:42,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">time that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't use informal meeting</font>

41
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:46,099
in a face-to-face update session

42
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:52,008
face-to-face editing session so let's

43
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:55,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">leap into the chair of slides our</font>

00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:56,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">Charter is on this website and if we go</font>

45
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,750
back to our<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter we had three</font>

46
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:02,840
deliverables yang data models and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

47
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:06,080
turned out having um we divided it into

48
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:09,020
two at first<font color="#CCCCCC"> and three later to around</font>

49
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,020
connection less protocols one around

50
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,639
connection oriented we were also going

51
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,919
to have an architecture document<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

52
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,110
applicability document but those both

53
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,940
got subsumed into the data models

54
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:23,150
because they they were both<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a</font>

55
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:26,360
paragraph long so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically our task is</font>

56
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,679
to finish three documents and those are

57
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">the three documents that we currently</font>

58
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">have as working group items all the</font>

59
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,130
other documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been subsumed now</font>

60
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:39,860
what is our status well the two

61
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,570
connectionless documents in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my opinion</font>

62
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,000
and that's why there's a question mark

63
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:46,219
there they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really close to being</font>

64
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,900
ready for working group last call we had

65
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">two really productive into her meetings</font>

66
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,310
and I think they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty close to</font>

67
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:55,159
cooked the connection oriented document

68
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:56,870
isn't all that far behind it we learned

69
00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:00,680
an awful lot doing the connection less

70
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:04,310
and we kind of know how to how to attack

71
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:08,289
that one now but<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the news isn't</font>

72
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:10,849
cheery um it's much later than you think

73
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:14,479
this working group was<font color="#CCCCCC"> charted two years</font>

74
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:19,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago to do three young models and the</font>

75
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:21,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">yang models were due over a year ago the</font>

76
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:23,090
window of opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> is passing when</font>

77
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,190
this working group was initially

78
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:28,210
chartered we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we were</font>

79
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:31,210
building a framework<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was augmented</font>

80
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:33,610
and different<font color="#E5E5E5"> working groups that did</font>

81
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:36,399
different oam mechanisms would augment

82
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,349
it BFD would put some stuff in and

83
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,779
everybody who doesn't know IM model

84
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,399
would put something in well as it turns

85
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:43,838
out we've taken so long that these

86
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,480
working groups are going ahead without

87
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:55,060
us as time slips so does our relevance

88
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:58,420
so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group chairs</font>

89
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,459
bombshell um we're going to work really

90
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:04,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">hard and get the connectionless drafts</font>

91
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:07,420
to the iesg by the next IETF meeting the

92
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:10,959
connection oriented draft by the meeting

93
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,729
after that and we will shut down at that

94
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:17,020
meeting regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

95
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:19,600
progress we made so if we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> making</font>

96
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:23,160
significant progress in the next two ITF

97
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,390
that's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> an indicator that um</font>

98
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,040
that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not making significant</font>

99
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:30,370
progress and probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't get there</font>

100
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:35,740
before before the window of opportunity

101
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:39,910
closes anyhow um is there any any strong

102
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:42,279
reaction to any of that front bumpers

103
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,260
quick questionnaire<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I'm sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

104
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:46,120
name again Frank brokers what's the

105
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:50,649
rationale so if you go one slide back

106
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:56,440
mm-hmm<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

107
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:58,450
connectionless is me already<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I think</font>

108
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,339
the connection orientated is a little

109
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:03,760
further along than the connection less

110
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:08,790
yes yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so it gets one more IETF</font>

111
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:11,649
and I think if you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> one step or hmm I</font>

112
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,510
do believe that the connection or I

113
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:16,149
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the numbers wrong so they</font>

114
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:18,279
the connection oriented it is a little

115
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:20,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">further along than the connection less</font>

116
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:24,040
whoops my bad right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's cool</font>

117
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:25,690
unless on this slide if I meant to give

118
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,540
the connectionless a little bit more

119
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:31,149
time sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> i right I reverse them on</font>

120
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,069
this slide a connection less should get

121
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:35,110
more time okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> site</font>

122
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:39,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">not in good shape I'll fix</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that slide</font>

123
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,910
and post it again Greg yes great what

124
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:45,609
does

125
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:48,730
Greg Greg risky I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what I</font>

126
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:55,360
wonder is that at some point we agreed

127
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:58,570
that yes we work on a paradigm packet

128
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,530
switching networks connection-oriented

129
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:06,010
connectionless OEM but we understand

130
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:12,640
that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more abstract</font>

131
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:14,860
model that will unify this to into some

132
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,069
single model which could be very thin

133
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:20,730
very light but still will be very

134
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:27,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">helpful because that will ultimately the</font>

135
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:30,760
realization of our goal as ah abstract

136
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:32,680
OEM model for the multi-layer

137
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,990
environment because in a multi-layer

138
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,050
environment the transport usually will

139
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:40,690
be a connection-oriented network and

140
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,510
then overlay will probably be

141
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:45,250
connectionless<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this sounds like a</font>

142
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,600
reasonable thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

143
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can abstract from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

144
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,870
connectionless and connection oriented

145
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,400
and put it on its own domain that is

146
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,900
what you're saying no yes abstract

147
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,060
what's common factor out what's common

148
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'd agree that might that might be a</font>

149
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,650
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to do the question is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can it</font>

150
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:09,160
be done in two I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ETFs or will it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

151
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:13,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">six</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idf's again with enough thrust and</font>

152
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:18,100
pitbull I so it all depends on

153
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:20,050
participation of the group if you can

154
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:24,330
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that pig fly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I encourage you to do</font>

155
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,329
so and we'll all<font color="#CCCCCC"> have barbecue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

156
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:36,580
binoculars I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> confused here because</font>

157
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:40,180
okay the goal of lime was to get one

158
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:43,240
young model then we said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's</font>

159
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:45,550
impossible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get one yang model me to</font>

160
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,610
divide us into two connection elestren

161
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:51,040
oriented then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> divide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into three for</font>

162
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,930
the method which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with now we're</font>

163
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,680
telling with was correct that maybe you

164
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,229
want to go back

165
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,810
the abstraction which was the goal

166
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:02,140
initially but it proved<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be not</font>

167
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:05,979
possible so what am<font color="#CCCCCC"> I missing there well</font>

168
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:08,770
um there is a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> as to whether</font>

169
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:11,050
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible or not and it's probably</font>

170
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,610
not appropriate for the chair to say it

171
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,770
is or isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the work of the</font>

172
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:18,010
working group but what the chair can say

173
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:21,699
is if you can do it correctly and

174
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:26,800
quickly show it to me and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font>

175
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:29,020
then two models three models or maybe no

176
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,500
models is the right answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

177
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:34,959
understood then we conclude it wasn't

178
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,959
possible a thesis was my understanding

179
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:40,420
by dividing into connection lesson

180
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:43,359
oriented hmm my conclusion was that the

181
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:46,959
groove concluded it was not possible in

182
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:50,380
abstraction mm-hmm and I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

183
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,609
was the conclusion too um I see some of

184
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,339
the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who were in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> favor of</font>

185
00:13:51,610 --> 00:14:00,100
splitting it up and don't see any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

186
00:13:54,339 --> 00:14:05,529
them coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the mic that's an</font>

187
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:08,589
invitation my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jim actually I</font>

188
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:10,209
think obviously bigger<font color="#CCCCCC"> punch up into</font>

189
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:12,250
several job i think is based on

190
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:14,020
discussion and the consumers who will

191
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,779
follow these condenser if we break these

192
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:19,300
consistent by too much it all of this

193
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:25,330
job into why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think i was also kind of</font>

194
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:30,790
confused<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ragnar ski again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay a little</font>

195
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:34,570
bit history their initial draft to one

196
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:37,569
group came from the true model and it

197
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:41,170
took some time to agree that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the trio</font>

198
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:44,079
presents connection-oriented through<font color="#CCCCCC"> OEM</font>

199
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:49,150
presents connection-oriented OEM

200
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:52,569
paradigm and then we didn't split it we

201
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:54,930
just designated we clarified what it

202
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:57,790
does and then started the work on

203
00:14:54,930 --> 00:15:01,689
connectionless but at a time of the

204
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:05,230
discussion are at least my recollection

205
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,520
was that we agreed that even though

206
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font>

207
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,079
technology specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> a.m. our</font>

208
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:15,160
ultimate goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to have an abstraction</font>

209
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:17,680
layer that unifies these two models<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

210
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,770
so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> about merging them because</font>

211
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,140
they cannot be merged they are distinct

212
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:29,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the paradigms of the network are</font>

213
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:32,110
distinct but we agreed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's well</font>

214
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,410
worth effort to have an abstraction

215
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:38,470
layer that uses probably i don't know we

216
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:42,430
we call the test points and test

217
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:45,790
functions that will hide specifics of

218
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:47,319
their network paradigm let me ask let me

219
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:50,939
propose something and ask for a show of

220
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:54,400
hands from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people in the room I</font>

221
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:56,680
challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Greg to produce some text</font>

222
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:00,040
that describes the abstraction layer and

223
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,689
I don't mean an email<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean yang Yang</font>

224
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:07,660
model that describes the abstraction

225
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:09,520
layer hang on if within four weeks you

226
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:13,660
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that done and the working group</font>

227
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:17,050
salutes it then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopted and it goes</font>

228
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,730
in to our work path if it's not complete

229
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:23,349
or the working group doesn't salute it

230
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:25,060
then it may be the right thing to do but

231
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,710
we just don't have the time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it</font>

232
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:30,640
because the window of opportunity is

233
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:34,900
closing there enough i just want to

234
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:37,540
mention<font color="#E5E5E5"> that probably before berlin i</font>

235
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:41,260
send over<font color="#E5E5E5"> a proposal and i got no</font>

236
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:44,160
response to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> could you send it again</font>

237
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:46,950
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time with yang</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tet with yang i</font>

238
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:51,819
send with some yang prototype that

239
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:53,730
basically used<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reference fat ok I'd</font>

240
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:57,010
ask you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again today and</font>

241
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:59,860
that will start discussion of it I'll

242
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:01,569
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dig it up this week</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok then</font>

243
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:05,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometime this week is yeah the week is</font>

244
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:11,470
kind of busy hmm by the way does

245
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:15,510
everybody like that proposal is anyone

246
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:17,390
paying attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

247
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:22,260
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> jeff has is always paying attention</font>

248
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:24,959
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a channel actually I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

249
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:27,300
I follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Greg's proposal actually</font>

250
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,550
you know for sale<font color="#CCCCCC"> OEM model actually</font>

251
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,200
solid dude on top of the length of logic

252
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,840
model network approaching model has all

253
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,950
the abstract thought logic so we already

254
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:42,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">do such kind of attraction so if we'll</font>

255
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:45,510
grab a compose another active Rosie and

256
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:49,100
we can take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but the way</font>

257
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:56,940
already chaiyya chaiyya<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to do that</font>

258
00:17:49,100 --> 00:18:00,480
the thing is that again in connection

259
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:05,870
oriented and connectionless networks the

260
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:09,690
topology could be described by the same

261
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:13,199
model but OEM is different because if

262
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:16,320
you are connection-oriented then you

263
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,080
have to care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about their miss connection</font>

264
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,980
defects which is not the case in

265
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:26,520
connectionless<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so there are some</font>

266
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:31,040
distinct differences in models that is

267
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:34,860
why we discussed and agreed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

268
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:37,889
yank models for OEM connection-oriented

269
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">elfin connectionless at this point</font>

270
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:42,660
probably debating about it in

271
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:45,300
abstractions won't help very much if you

272
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,860
could make the proposal in email we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

273
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:51,990
discuss the proposal on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> list and</font>

274
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,520
today's<font color="#E5E5E5"> November 14th on December 14th</font>

275
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,470
will have a cut off on the discussion

276
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,510
either we accept the proposal or not and

277
00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:03,420
we can remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> December</font>

278
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:06,420
14th is Beethoven's birthday Benoit the

279
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,890
Nautilus so you know if the obstruction

280
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,540
would speak about is simply like the

281
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,850
endpoints it could be like it tight

282
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:14,310
death which anyway we have hit apology

283
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:18,810
right that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing I should go</font>

284
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:22,710
to your next slide please shut down by

285
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:25,560
ITF 99 I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing so many times</font>

286
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:28,860
that those draft and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yang models are</font>

287
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:32,580
almost ready for<font color="#CCCCCC"> so many meetings</font>

288
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:35,639
at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> state is important the window of</font>

289
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,639
 mention I strongly believe in to

290
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,580
that if we don't deliver it does not

291
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,110
matter right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different OEM</font>

292
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:48,530
mechanism will have their own yang

293
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:55,040
models and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are not relevant actually</font>

294
00:19:48,530 --> 00:20:00,480
I want to clarify and so we already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

295
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:05,010
yank models that I believe I should not

296
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:08,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">be impacted by lime models but it</font>

297
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:13,559
bearable be beneficial for the lime to

298
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:19,890
use them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rbd young model</font>

299
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:23,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">a t1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> p and model</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can name mpls</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> LSP</font>

301
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:32,790
model so these models already<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist and</font>

302
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:35,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">I believe that why model has to</font>

303
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:37,470
accommodate them rather than force these

304
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,020
models to change so clearly but the

305
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:44,630
question now is given<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these models</font>

306
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:46,940
exist what value<font color="#CCCCCC"> does lie mad ah I</font>

307
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:50,429
believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a value and</font>

308
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:55,260
especially the value because we want to

309
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:59,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">create some abstraction and so because</font>

310
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:02,610
for the same of VFD BFD is working in

311
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:05,760
connection oriented networks in mpls-tp

312
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:12,629
as it works in connectionless networks

313
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:14,760
in itni p.m. pls so I'm drawing a mental

314
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:17,520
model of what we would have if we

315
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:23,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">continued with all of these models plus</font>

316
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:26,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">com lime there would be end models which</font>

317
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:29,730
overlap which model a partially

318
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:31,950
overlapping set of stuff now the

319
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:34,980
partially over lettings overlapping

320
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,600
stuff would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> modeled one way for one</font>

321
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,750
protocol another way for another

322
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:42,189
protocol and yet a third way by yang in

323
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,629
the abstract way

324
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,580
I'm scratching my head and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering</font>

325
00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:50,139
what the value does that add but again

326
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:53,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">in my view are four existing models why</font>

327
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:57,428
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> though can argument are the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> b of d</font>

328
00:21:53,919 --> 00:22:01,169
and be done with it because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you</font>

329
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:03,720
don't have to redefine how you enable

330
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:07,389
continually check-in connectionless

331
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,070
network because you already have<font color="#CCCCCC"> VFD</font>

332
00:22:07,389 --> 00:22:11,709
model so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what you're doing is</font>

333
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:15,399
turning lime on its head at one<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

334
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:18,850
lime was the common area that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an</font>

335
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:24,489
abstraction that all the other protocols

336
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:29,980
didn't have to do now lime augments and

337
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:34,120
other protocols with with something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

338
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:38,529
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> already have in my view the lime is</font>

339
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:45,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">their model of saying or enabling</font>

340
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:49,179
operator to execute or instantiate

341
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:51,789
certain om functionality<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

342
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:53,879
basically if you're in the network and

343
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:58,000
you want to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we want to monitor</font>

344
00:22:53,879 --> 00:23:00,939
continuity between a and B then are you

345
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,950
go into more technical our<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology in</font>

346
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:09,190
paradigm specific definition which is

00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:11,379
based or argumentative I tech nology

348
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:15,490
specific solution how you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it whether</font>

349
00:23:11,379 --> 00:23:19,480
it's a BFD or it's something else 1731

350
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:23,580
like and then in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that environment you</font>

351
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,580
provide the specific parameters of your

00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:28,600
protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's see I want to go a</font>

353
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,639
little more into the role of chairing

354
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:34,059
and not the debater so does anybody else

355
00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:39,610
have any other any other feelings on

356
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:44,980
this this is channel actually based on

357
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:48,399
collaboration from the greg i feel i did

358
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:53,320
with the contradiction you know for for

359
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:55,678
the motor design though so I guys I feel

360
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,678
confused

361
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably the best thing we</font>

362
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,870
can do is ask Greg to proposes yang

363
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:07,220
model proposes changes to the yang model

364
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:09,629
will evaluate them by<font color="#E5E5E5"> December 14 and</font>

365
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:12,870
either move<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward with them or not but</font>

366
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:23,669
in any event we're still<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at an</font>

367
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:26,820
ietf 99 deadline any other comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

368
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:28,890
um now we will move on to the this time

369
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,629
I'll get them right I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> confuse the</font>

370
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:33,360
connection lesson connection-oriented we

371
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:36,650
will go with the connection less update

372
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,649
first and

373
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,360
and I have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> long one</font>

374
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:17,379
and that is certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wrong one</font>

375
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,700
I thought this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be easier to</font>

376
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,700
control

377
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay let's do it this way</font>

378
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,780
there

also introduce our proposal I think we

make some consensus that the technology

you may do that no if we're saying that

00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:41,270
you need to do augmentation because

483
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:12,490
to defend<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of parameters it can</font>

describe in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> techno specific modules</font>

485
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:19,750
though so perhaps we want to address a

486
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:22,360
land problem of the urban didn't learn

487

<font color="#CCCCCC">independence a problem perhaps we need</font>

491
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:37,300
attribute and if you have if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

492
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:41,290
neither talk about specific module is it

493
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:46,030
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can provide another solution</font>

494
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:50,290
for the user the user can flexible chose

495
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:53,139
to use it kind of a specific module uses

496
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:55,990
module and the land structure built a

497
00:33:53,140 --> 00:34:00,730
new module to address it Lance narrow<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

498
00:33:55,990 --> 00:34:03,880
I have two questions to that first if

499
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:07,360
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to be a tied to the</font>

500
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:10,899
specific mechanism to do continuity

501
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:15,250
check then why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> connectionless OEM</font>

502
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:21,100
model includes the container with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list</font>

503
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:25,050
of RFC 58 8158 8350 84 and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

504
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:28,870
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> specific to me write a</font>

505
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:32,230
second of all are if you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there</font>

506
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:35,679
are other mechanisms to do continue to

507
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:40,149
check in<font color="#E5E5E5"> connectionless networks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font>

508
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:43,600
be interested to learn which you mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

509
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:46,359
first first question is thus far into

510
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:49,810
theta shows as captivity it's now<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

511
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:53,169
defense in detail it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows this</font>

512
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:57,700
device<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok i cants policies choose and</font>

513
00:34:53,168 --> 00:35:00,850
we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> not defined it it more we not</font>

514
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:05,980
defined more technology talk no specific

515
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:09,940
details so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a part of I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it</font>

516
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:13,890
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a part of abstract module it can</font>

517
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:16,930
provide ability it can provide the

518
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:17,740
letter user know of what what what

519
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:19,779
should I

520
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:23,020
quote excuse me about it it's quite

521
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:26,950
specific that your<font color="#E5E5E5"> listing I be the</font>

522
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:30,250
single hub<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-hop and Vav over mpls</font>

523
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:32,589
LSP and Vav or to the way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's</font>

524
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:36,780
a very specific you're not saying oh I

525
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:39,730
can do continua t check and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do it</font>

526
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:43,840
you'll figure it out when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do</font>

527
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:47,380
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's that's the</font>

528
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:54,190
level of abstraction for the line is I

529
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:57,190
do continue to check fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we can</font>

530
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:58,869
discuss it later and I I think that

531
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:05,080
that's that's the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we had</font>

532
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:08,950
for not the first idea and i sent the

533
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:12,520
comments in working group adoption call

534
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:17,500
and it's still there and at the same

535
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:20,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">time you say that augmentation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VFD</font>

536
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:23,050
model is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> to technology specific I</font>

537
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:28,869
think that these two statements don't

538
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:30,180
connect to me look I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think somebody want</font>

539
00:36:28,869 --> 00:36:33,280
you want to comment on the same issue

540
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:35,500
yeah question on the combination<font color="#E5E5E5"> so red</font>

541
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,560
would it be is the proposal to just get

542
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:40,359
rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> references and with that</font>

543
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,310
solve the problem because then that's a

544
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:45,340
fairly easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach solve the problem</font>

545
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:47,710
ah that would be only half solution in

546
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:50,950
my view I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the solution would</font>

547
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:54,670
be yes remove this list of RFC's not

548
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:58,029
only related to BFD but orbs is because

549
00:36:54,670 --> 00:37:00,609
they are too cryptic they require a

550
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:02,830
person to know what this RFC is about

551
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:05,170
and instead of that use the

552
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:08,850
functionality if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing for</font>

553
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:11,710
example LSP thing then its on demand

554
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:14,980
continua tea and connectivity check you

555
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:18,550
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it overall LSP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on to the wire</font>

556
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:20,460
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> ls meeting for the 379 this</font>

557
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:23,470
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the better the reference</font>

558
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:27,130
but we have a model for LSP thing or

559
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:30,029
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP pain if it's likely a network</font>

560
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:32,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

561
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:35,490
reference particular RFC you just say on

562
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:37,410
demand continually check and activity

563
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:39,540
verification period everything else

564
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:43,020
technology-specific and if we have

565
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:46,680
already model like in case of LSP being

566
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:49,220
just augmented there that's actually

567
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:52,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">fairly easy change to make would be okay</font>

568
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:54,899
yes yeah then the same in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same in</font>

greetings from one of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> lives I</font>

00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:38,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so you've meant it that means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

581
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,259
the line model in infinitely like what

582
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:46,070
we have also imprint<font color="#CCCCCC"> almost other models</font>

583
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:49,770
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh well otherwise how would you</font>

584
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:54,300
instantiate BFD if you don't implement

585
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:56,460
the v-model like the don't you can do

00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:05,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">as well so it feels the discussion of</font>

590
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:07,230
the Lima augmenting of the emoji

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:21,690
am again um I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that if because</font>

again the lime in my view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the line</font>

don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about other examples because</font>

598
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:31,529
yes we can talk actually we agreed that

599
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:33,120
performance measurement is will be

600
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:36,270
separate and actually that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

601
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:39,569
that I realized that is not on our

602
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:43,440
timeline so what will happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> line</font>

603
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:45,720

604
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,869
something that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we missed in</font>

605
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:52,230
the earlier discussion today but if we

606
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:56,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about for example our existing LSB</font>

00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:03,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">they have to be implemented if you want</font>

609
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:09,780
to realize the potential of

610
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:12,030
connectionless om ah CFM is not

611
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:15,119
connectionless CFM requires your

612
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:16,560
connection you define your MA<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mag</font>

613
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:23,609
and it's different<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a connection</font>

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:26,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">oriented model action it's a different</font>

615
00:40:23,609 --> 00:40:33,750
question I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that we haven't really</font>

616
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:38,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">got to do how lime relates to ethernet</font>

619
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:55,530
for the carrier ethernet service so how

620
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:57,390
why model and MAF 38 correspond<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

621
00:40:55,530 --> 00:41:07,410
then with then we can then we can ignore

622
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:10,710
CFM<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm again uh we had this</font>

623
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:15,540
discussion and how who I'm work related

00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:20,599
decided we I don't know whether we have

626
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:23,849
a clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution I think that our</font>

627
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:27,150
implicit agreement was that why model is

628
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:29,730
applicable to technologies developed at

629
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:36,300

631
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:41,940
that's again if I misrepresenting please

632
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:43,859
correct me because that that's my that's

633
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,869
my that's my recollection of our

634
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:49,109
discussion we had this discussion yes

635
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:54,140
but we I think that agreed that we only

636
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:54,140
lime covers thrill and mpls-tp

637
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:04,420

discussion we can some concern sir and

642
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:19,750
we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't need to and argue</font>

645
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:28,630
you defined is a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of specific module</font>

661
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:28,210
screaming bound hi I'm Roger Luca and

662
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:30,970
I'm a co-author of this scheme amount

663
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:33,940
and draft in the net not working group

664
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:36,129
and I'm a bit worried that now that

665
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:39,070
scheme amount becomes sort of

666
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:42,790
fashionable term that people will start

667
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:44,980
using it instead of normal augment that

668
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:49,839
that we have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for several</font>

669
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:52,510
years so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is that scheme amount</font>

670
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:56,349
is useful in cases where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to use</font>

671
00:43:52,510 --> 00:44:01,450
the same yen module in different places

672
00:43:56,349 --> 00:44:04,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">in your data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are key like you f</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

673
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:07,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">a module that could work for a simple</font>

674
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:09,549
physical device and then you also won't

675
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:11,860
use it in some kind of

676
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:14,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">realization like in routing instance and</font>

677
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:17,800
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so suddenly the same</font>

678
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:20,890
data becomes somewhere berating inside

679
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:23,170
the hierarchy and then of course if you

680
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:25,000
for example one to augment this module

681
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:28,240
eight something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else you have to specify</font>

682
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,850
a precise place so and you cannot do it

683
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:34,330
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same time for both for the</font>

684
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:37,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">top-level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> location and for some mounted</font>

685
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:40,450
location so that's for this this is the

686
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:44,110
use case for scheme amount if you talk

687
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:47,200
about like adding some technology

688
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:50,320
specific knobs and things like that then

689
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,410
in my view<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a normal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> augment should</font>

690
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:56,260
work so as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really have only</font>

691
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:59,319
a single place or you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put this</font>

692
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:01,930
new stuff then an augment should work so

693
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:04,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would recommend you to look at at</font>

694
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:06,580
augment first as as soon as you realize

695
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:10,000
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't work for for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our use</font>

696
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:12,970
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

697
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,190
scheme among but as far as I can tell

698
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:17,770
this could work and also I'm a bit

699
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:20,440
confused about the use of grouping which

700
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:22,990
is what probably also mention is really

701
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,910
but a real the group he is some<font color="#E5E5E5"> group in</font>

702
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:30,689
defunding days technology specifically

703
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:33,879
such as dirty and obvious and Tiaras LCP

704
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:36,040
mpls-tp as it offends some<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

705
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,110
reels in<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't want to</font>

706

709
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:49,870
land motive there's a different me today

710
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:51,940
I don't know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> details just to warn</font>

711
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:55,089
you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these groupings you don't work</font>

712
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:58,540
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> object-oriented classes for example</font>

713
00:45:55,090 --> 00:46:00,400
so that really you you you if you want

714
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:03,430
to use a grouping let's use a specific

715
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:06,940
grouping from a specific module so it's

716
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:09,940
not possible like to to have some object

717
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:12,340
oriented inheritance and so you just go

718
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:15,130
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a grouping into it will it will be</font>

719
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:16,870
somehow magically<font color="#CCCCCC"> filton middle stuff</font>

720
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:19,420
that that's really really harmful for

721
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:22,330
the particular device so but I just yes

722
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:22,930
this is about this is the fourth our

723
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:25,270
land

724
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:28,660

00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:33,130
extend the alarm to Jocelyn their<font color="#CCCCCC"> Theory</font>

726
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:35,589

729
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:44,500
the means a flick bility yeah so my

730
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:46,510
conclusion this moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just go for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

731
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:48,640
augment possible and if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

732
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:54,520
problems and feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> free</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to contact me if</font>

733
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:59,879
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to us thank you thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bergner</font>

734
00:46:54,520 --> 00:47:03,940
skiing in I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to stress is that</font>

735
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:07,210
if argument statement that list

736
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:10,510
explicitly the model that we argument in

737
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:15,970
till I'm Liam model connectionless is

738
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:23,650
not part of their model then it would

739
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:27,220
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be augmented so it cannot be part of</font>

740
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:30,700
all you can argument no it has to be

741
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:34,379
part of the base model the augmentation

742
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:37,720
has to be part of the base model if our

743
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:41,579
operator doesn't want to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> proactive a</font>

744
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:45,759
continuity verification then it's fine

745
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:49,599
but you cannot do augmentation on a fly

746
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:53,290
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wheel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so please understand</font>

747
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:56,589
that okay this is a purple Emily faced

748
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:58,990
for land we just provide this a common

749
00:47:56,589 --> 00:48:02,710
structure on the we can now that defined

750
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:06,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">is some techno specific modules you know</font>

00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:09,059
which each other way clarity to Colonel

00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:11,980
aesthetic module need to defending the

protocol working group and kind of

754
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:19,030
specified working group therefore in the

755
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:21,579
lime audio we we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just can provide the</font>

00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:36,430
provide this article city's ability you

760
00:48:33,069 --> 00:48:40,150
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this but we don't</font>

00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:42,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">12 effort and why is ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

762
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:45,840
again I have to point the contradiction

763
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:51,069
of your statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the fact that</font>

764
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:54,130
model lists their numerous RFC's which

765
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:57,750
are technologists specific so either

766
00:48:54,130 --> 00:49:00,630
remove all of them out of your model and

767
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:03,220
have no connection to their

768
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:07,750
instantiation because otherwise if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

769
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:11,290
don't have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of use existing methods</font>

770
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:14,260
which are protocols or am protocols be

771
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:18,580
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> D or anything else then I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

772
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:22,810
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> value of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> line model at all okay if</font>

773
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:26,920
you cannot do from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lyme obstruction to</font>

774
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:33,580
go into technology specific protocol

775
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:37,750
then what's the value I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

776
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:41,250
their value of lime is that you say I

777
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:44,350
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or am functionality and</font>

778
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:47,260
that gets you into technology specific

779
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:49,779
or if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the operational</font>

780
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:53,290
state say give me the operational state

781
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:58,120
between a and B and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it either does</font>

782
00:49:53,290 --> 00:50:01,330
you on demand verification or post the

783
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:05,470
state of a proactive session and how

784
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:07,330
does its technology specific but if you

785
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:10,209
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this connection to their</font>

786
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:14,430
technology to the specificity of your

787
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:14,430
paradigm what's the value of lime

788
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:40,280
binoculars so let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me ask the stupid</font>

789
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:45,259
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and goes I'm slightly confused</font>

790
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:53,210
so connection less and<font color="#E5E5E5"> bfg which one or</font>

791
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:56,780
comment which one for<font color="#CCCCCC"> lanza kwon do we</font>

792
00:50:53,210 --> 00:51:01,010
use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> landline at this motive and also</font>

793
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:04,010
in holds a BFA module so we imported the

794
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:09,590
FD module pocket fine now under you are

795
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:12,740
you know cell and module<font color="#CCCCCC"> liability we do</font>

796
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:16,520
some tennis<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your let me</font>

797
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:19,970
clarity it a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually we in our face</font>

798
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:22,340
model with not extend from base pft

799
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:26,209
model we empower network topological

800
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:29,150
model and import a<font color="#CCCCCC"> metal instance model</font>

801
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:33,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">but we don't actually import a PFD model</font>

802
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:35,720
here we show this applicability we tell

803
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:38,660
you how to extend it base model so we

804
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:41,000
talk about the youth organizer honest

805
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:46,879
apply to the model exchange not apply to

806
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:48,950
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> pace</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the model</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I'm</font>

807
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:53,180
hearing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bfg model will go along</font>

808
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:56,450
alone anyway right that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so</font>

809
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:59,740
we want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a line model that will</font>

810
00:51:56,450 --> 00:52:03,319
be augmented for OEM specific technology

811
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:06,259
right yeah good so which one do we have

812
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:09,290
we've got like a potentially sfc or beer

813
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:11,180
or auntie one so these are those guys

814
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:14,690
are talking to in<font color="#E5E5E5"> film trying to get</font>

815
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:18,319
them to linked to lime while for BFD too

816
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:21,910
late this the idea trail<font color="#CCCCCC"> working groups</font>

817
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:28,100
they have trail OEM llamado and augment

818
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:30,799
seal motive yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so change so</font>

819
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:33,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">commitment let's see if I understand the</font>

820
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:37,790
answer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your question the ultimate</font>

821
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:41,150
value of lime depends on our ability to

822
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:42,900
influence these other working groups to

823
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:46,500
augment line

824
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:50,700
what this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> charmander Stan it</font>

825
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:54,390
was too late for<font color="#E5E5E5"> BFD already is now the</font>

826
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:56,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">next question is are the other groups</font>

827
00:52:54,390 --> 00:53:00,240
highly motivated to do so or are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

828
00:52:56,970 --> 00:53:04,169
working on an airplane that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will never</font>

829
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:06,479
leave the ground that's the question

830
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:09,319
what is the value of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lime or we're too</font>

831
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:13,589
late already if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have like a</font>

832
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:16,558
module with a container a pointer to an

833
00:53:13,589 --> 00:53:19,288
<font color="#CCCCCC">oem specific yang module I mean all</font>

834
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:25,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so what is the value right a</font>

835
00:53:19,289 --> 00:53:27,779
container telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay BFD anyone this</font>

836
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:29,520
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a derail in question but maybe we</font>

837
00:53:27,779 --> 00:53:31,890
should think about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for just a while</font>

838
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:39,359
and think about whether it makes sense

839
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:41,759
to continue work<font color="#CCCCCC"> project just one</font>

840
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:45,920
comment so if the situation is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

841
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:49,349
have some modules<font color="#CCCCCC"> at our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or they ready</font>

842
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:52,589
some other working groups and you want

843
00:53:49,349 --> 00:53:55,140
to take these modules and put them to

844
00:53:52,589 --> 00:53:57,390
some place in your hierarchy then of

845
00:53:55,140 --> 00:54:01,259
course it may be a use case or false

846
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:03,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">king among because in this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> case the</font>

847
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:07,410
extra stuff that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to add needn't</font>

848
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:09,660
care about your your basic structure so

849
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:11,879
they needn't put any augments in there

850
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:14,038
more you so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just take their</font>

851
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:17,460
modules and put it somewhere there are

852
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:20,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">some limitations what you can do and</font>

853
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:22,500
cannot do but that's of course the

854
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:25,289
option but I really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

855
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:27,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">details I would have to look into what</font>

856
00:54:25,289 --> 00:54:30,119
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and trying to achieve</font>

857
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:32,339
because i cannot tell me we can discuss

858
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:35,190
it more just to come in on that below

859
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:38,430
again so let's remember that<font color="#CCCCCC"> charter was</font>

860
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:41,369
about consistent configuration reporting

861
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:43,980
and presentation if we change based on

862
00:54:41,369 --> 00:54:45,809
what letter set right the configuration

863
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:47,609
it's too late<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FD they're going</font>

864
00:54:45,809 --> 00:54:49,470
to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own module they're not</font>

865
00:54:47,609 --> 00:54:51,180
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a hierarchy that we've got</font>

866
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:54,149
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you do a scheme amount to what</font>

867
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:56,700
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> had right that's the first thing so</font>

868
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:58,829
for BFD the config part is over

869
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:03,089
we might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to influence some other</font>

870
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:05,130
OEM mechanism the new ones sfc beer or

871
00:55:03,089 --> 00:55:08,099
maybe t1 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever will</font>

872
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:11,430
come right maybe if you got a nice model

873
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:14,190
we could augment that now to come back

874
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:17,940
to BFD then then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> value of lime</font>

875
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:21,540
is what the potentially the command the

876
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:23,280
the consistent reporting<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they</font>

877
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:25,980
wink of a scheme amount that says and

878
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:28,320
this is the container that the pond

879
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:30,930
amount points for BFD and it's the same

880
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:33,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">level of the different mechanisms this</font>

881
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:38,970
is the only added value of lime in that

882
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:41,250
case which is tiny but it right so I

883
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:43,439
think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just acknowledges for certain</font>

884
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:45,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that this is Frank for certain</font>

885
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:49,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">things the train has clearly left the</font>

886
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:51,450
station via fig on trolled on fine check

887
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:55,380
there are other trains waiting in the

888
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:56,819
station beer maybe sfc let's go try

889
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:59,400
right and given that the work has

890
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:01,589
progressed quite far let's give it a try

891
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,420
let's go publish this stuff and then if

892
00:56:01,589 --> 00:56:05,250
people pick it up and it's good if

893
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:08,220
people don't pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it wasn't</font>

894
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:10,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">good enough so and you have some printed</font>

895
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:12,509
paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's worth while</font>

896
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:14,550
continuing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then getting it done and</font>

897
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:16,170
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quickly as opposed</font>

898
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:17,910
to are seeing the question should we go

899
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:20,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">and continue right now given that you're</font>

900
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:22,859
so close to the finish line velocity I

901
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:25,200
got not run was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it seemed that it</font>

902
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:27,930
took us like so much time<font color="#E5E5E5"> at ease in</font>

903
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:32,189
little hat ujin's try to summarize this

904
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:35,910
right and and you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked to have</font>

905
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:37,890
a wiki with the different OEM mechanism

906
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:40,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">connection let fashion oriented whether</font>

907
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:43,170
we influence those guys whether in their

908
00:56:40,109 --> 00:56:45,290
interest to augment line etc we have to

909
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:48,720
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to this which was requested like</font>

910
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:51,029
three meetings ago right because if in

911
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:54,000
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> column telling is their</font>

912
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:57,839
interests to augment<font color="#E5E5E5"> line and the answer</font>

913
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:04,190
is no from everybody then except to

914
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:04,190
improve the reporting then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> value is</font>

915
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:25,770
Jeff Jeff tell us<font color="#CCCCCC"> your name hi my name</font>

916
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:28,710
is Jeff hey Jeff so Benoit specifically

917
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:32,099
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BFD</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point BFD does allow for</font>

918
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:33,840
configuration of VFD through other means

919
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:35,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">no that's for the reasons why we have</font>

920
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:37,310
that dependency across several other

921
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,930
modules we have groupings exported for

922
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:44,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">time and configuration so for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

923
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:47,310
ospf can enable the FD sessions line can

924
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:50,819
do exactly the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think your</font>

925
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:53,130
broader question is what should the

926
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:57,590
general<font color="#E5E5E5"> design pattern be 40 am like</font>

927
00:57:53,130 --> 00:58:01,560
things so that a device specific module

928
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:03,960
can be not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only in control of its own</font>

929
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:07,109
fate but allow for other no external

930
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:10,710
things by being<font color="#E5E5E5"> an example to do its job</font>

931
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:14,069
and similarly how can those device

932
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:16,589
specific modules you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide</font>

933
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:18,540
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is useful so that the</font>

934
00:58:16,589 --> 00:58:20,820
layer independent portion of mine can

935
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:24,270
actually get its job done the first one

936
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:26,060
in terms of general configuration the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FT</font>

937
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:28,080
is obviously a good example of that

938
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:30,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">Elle's ping I haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at the</font>

939
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:32,520
module as an example so it would be

940
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:35,130
interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if there's some way</font>

941
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:37,589
to provide similar groupings to allow

942
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:41,270
for external components to configuration

943
00:58:37,589 --> 00:58:43,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't have a strong opinion about the</font>

944
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:47,030
layer independent portions of the

945
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,030
operational state

946
00:58:54,119 --> 00:59:01,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so i will try to summarize what we</font>

947
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:04,240
just heard here and that is that again

948
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:06,700
the window of opportunity seems to have

949
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:10,089
gone for BFD and for trill we may get

950
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:13,419
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> window of opportunity for other oam</font>

951
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:16,390
mechanisms so let's work fast and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

952
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:17,800
this done so<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't you know it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seems</font>

953
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:20,109
like a relevance has to do with our time

954
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:26,619
to publication and I'm sorry you<font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font>

955
00:59:20,109 --> 00:59:27,910
slept Frank I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok Frank um Frank</font>

956
00:59:26,619 --> 00:59:30,220
mentioned we're so close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the finish</font>

957
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:32,170
line<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get to get to the finish</font>

958
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:34,839
line it's worth it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take another</font>

959
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:36,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">year to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the finish line but the</font>

960
00:59:34,839 --> 00:59:40,029
train will clearly have left the station

961
00:59:36,869 --> 00:59:44,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">so anyhow with that any more comments on</font>

962
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:45,910
connection less let's talk about the

963
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:48,700
connection oriented draft yeah one<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

964
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:50,529
chance that it would continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> jolicoeur</font>

965
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:52,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">ouya in the window for the DMV</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

966
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:56,800
ensure all<font color="#CCCCCC"> close absolute zero today</font>

967
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:59,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">standing on sale model hmm no for me ft</font>

968
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:02,920
it's closed but maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other so</font>

969
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:06,910
let's let's try hard to get get done by

970
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:08,680
ITF 99 and maybe we'll be there in time

971
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:15,848
to be relevant for some other away and

972
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:18,450
not mechanism<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't come up in fact if</font>

973
01:00:15,849 --> 01:00:23,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">flying proves to be useful then nothing</font>

974
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:27,129
prevents somebody from<font color="#E5E5E5"> adapting the BFD</font>

975
01:00:23,109 --> 01:00:29,170
model just be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we had the</font>

976
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:32,710
situation already weather radar outing

977
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:35,230
module that also try to provide some

978
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:38,230
some kind of a framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> that routing</font>

979
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:41,890
protocol would use but we now have<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

980
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:47,200
some more use for me GP for example that

981
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:51,009
just ignore<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work and just they</font>

982
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:53,828
wrote bethe model that starts from the

983
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:56,349
top and so what we've been trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

984
01:00:53,829 --> 01:00:59,230
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to convince people that maybe this</font>

985
01:00:56,349 --> 01:01:02,820
framework can be useful for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of</font>

986
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:06,210
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will take time so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

987
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:08,310
it's not carved in stone so if you want

988
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:11,040
you can just adapt their module use a

989
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:14,220
different name and put the<font color="#CCCCCC"> VFD stuff</font>

990
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:16,590
using an augment or something if it's

991
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:20,490
useful for you so that's another option

992
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">I I don't think that the fact that bfg</font>

993
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:25,259
working group is done means that you

994
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:28,980
cannot use their work in some other way

995
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:33,270
I need I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're real candidate ok</font>

996
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:37,320
any more on<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection less let's move</font>

997
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:39,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">on to connection-oriented then ok so</font>

question there are some AOE arrows in

1048
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:53,119
this module so in the previous version

1049
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:56,119
the sale module can pass the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PM exam but</font>

1050
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:59,780
enough camp as a young editor a truth

1051
01:04:56,119 --> 01:05:04,130
check and the way this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is arrows and now</font>

1052
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:08,930
it can pass the full of boxes to choose

1053
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:14,990
and this way<font color="#CCCCCC"> are deserve a proposal to</font>

1054

comments regarding the relationship

1062
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:46,370
between this model and mpls-tp<font color="#CCCCCC"> om model</font>

1063
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:53,270
so regrettably<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see this model as a</font>

1064
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:55,069
tool model it's not mpls-tp or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> model</font>

1065
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:58,490
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do have I'm pell st peoria</font>

1066
01:05:55,070 --> 01:06:03,970
model and I suggested<font color="#E5E5E5"> to argument it so</font>

1067
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:07,520
the document has information formational

1068
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:11,540
reference not the reference lists

1069
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:13,670
mpls-tp OEM yang model as informational

1070
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:17,210
reference but it not referenced anywhere

1071
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:20,080
in the text so which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of odd it's</font>

1072
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:25,600
a stale reference which is not used and

1073
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:31,840
again I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because mpls-tp is</font>

1074
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:37,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">another connection oriented network and</font>

1075
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:40,610
developed at ITF next to<font color="#CCCCCC"> trill if you</font>

1076
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:42,920
don't want to replicate mpls-tp<font color="#E5E5E5"> OEM</font>

1077
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:46,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">model you need to argument this model</font>

1078
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:49,100
into this base model<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so uh</font>

1079
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:52,910
otherwise you just replicating and

1080
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:57,770
duplicating mpls-tp OEM yang model that

1081
01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:59,299
already exists isn't this exactly the

1082
01:06:57,770 --> 01:07:02,810
same conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just had a minute</font>

1083
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:06,110
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yes your vacuum again so again</font>

1084
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:11,390
if if you if we agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> or we think that</font>

1085
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:14,150
mpls-tp OEM model left the station then

1086
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:22,009
remove the references from this document

1087
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:24,250
and make it trill model hear it anymore

1088

some next steps um and I see two big two

1092
01:07:37,859 --> 01:07:44,249
big obstacles to getting getting there

1093
01:07:40,309 --> 01:07:45,660
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> obstacle is the one of factoring out</font>

01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:13,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">December 14 um actually no I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

1101
01:08:05,099 --> 01:08:16,500
it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> December 17th but 16 okay</font>

1102
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:17,608
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay whatever Beethoven's birthday is</font>

1103
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:23,250
that's the day you'll come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font>

1104
01:08:17,609 --> 01:08:24,299
their 16th okay and um<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll decide you</font>

1105
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:26,698
know whether to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that piece of</font>

1106
01:08:24,299 --> 01:08:29,028
abstraction or not by then the other is

1107
01:08:26,698 --> 01:08:31,769
we have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> recurring discussion about</font>

1108
01:08:29,029 --> 01:08:36,929
augmentation and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it showing up</font>

1109
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:40,759
in both drafts um do you just reference

1110
01:08:36,929 --> 01:08:44,880
an RFC do you pull in parts do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

1111
01:08:40,759 --> 01:08:47,250
other working groups to augment the line

01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:49,699
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the line model and I think</font>

1113
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:51,960
we've come up with a solution that says

1114
01:08:49,698 --> 01:08:53,818
then somebody tell me if we don't have

1115
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:55,649
consensus on this solution but I think

1116
01:08:53,819 --> 01:09:01,080
the solution we have consensus on is

1117
01:08:55,649 --> 01:09:03,870
that we will not reference any rfcs for

1118
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:08,509
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> oam specific stuff we won't</font>

1119
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:12,948
reference the BFD rfcs but we will ask

1120
01:09:08,509 --> 01:09:16,259
other working groups not trill not BFD

1121
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:20,278
to augment the line model<font color="#E5E5E5"> with their</font>

1122
01:09:16,259 --> 01:09:24,479
stuff do I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that agreement right for</font>

1123
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:29,400
everybody except<font color="#E5E5E5"> BFD in trill for BFD in</font>

1124
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:33,238
trill what will we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so my</font>

1125
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:37,408
understanding is that will reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1126
01:09:33,238 --> 01:09:38,679
other groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on OEM frameworks</font>

1127
01:09:37,408 --> 01:09:44,080
and solutions

1128
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:48,550
to review lime models and consider their

1129
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:51,010
relevance is that right understanding

1130
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:53,320
because basically we're not enforcing

1131
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:56,020
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Y model onto them that's true if</font>

1132
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:58,780
they if nobody contributes anything if

1133
01:09:56,020 --> 01:10:02,620
nobody augments us at all we are useless

1134
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:04,800
with a capital<font color="#E5E5E5"> you okay i see head</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">started from two problems first one</font>

1142
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:34,450
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> yang was a very new thing second</font>

1143
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:39,130
one being the OEM technologies involved

1144
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:42,429
are very distinct things so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I'm</font>

1145
01:10:39,130 --> 01:10:45,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">DFD is anything i know well BF DS</font>

1146
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:47,530
management module and yang for the ietf

1147
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:51,040
has to be self-contained and

1148
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:53,830
self-sufficient for<font color="#E5E5E5"> ietf purposes and it</font>

1149
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:58,080
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to also serve in the capacity that</font>

1150
01:10:53,830 --> 01:11:01,930
it does for all the various protocols so

1151
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:04,320
we have to have something that can

1152
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:08,200
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> no satisfy those requirements</font>

1153
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:12,070
does lime add anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to that not</font>

1154
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:14,019
necessarily mm-hmm does lime making use

1155
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:18,400
of technologies add something

1156
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:20,320
potentially mm-hmm but if you can't

1157
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:23,259
figure out what you know that looks like

1158
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:26,740
now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've gone through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think in a</font>

1159
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:28,480
partial attentional I'm roughly two and

1160
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:30,010
a half different schemes of you know

1161
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:32,290
what the relationships of things look

1162
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:35,710
like know what the initial one being<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

1163
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:37,960
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of know why 1731</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i triple e</font>

1164
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:41,140
flavored no it was not something that

1165
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:43,120
was a good fit and the authors of no

1166
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:47,350
dental<font color="#E5E5E5"> that work to try to actually work</font>

1167
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:49,570
around that if you can't figure out what

1168
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:52,470
that looks like how can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask people</font>

1169
01:11:49,570 --> 01:11:52,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build on top of that</font>

1170
01:11:56,850 --> 01:12:02,350
offers<font color="#E5E5E5"> any it's an old discussion no</font>

1171
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:04,840
that's that's where most of the churn in

1172
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:06,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">the documents has gone through is trying</font>

1173
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:09,640
to actually find good mappings between

1174
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:11,710
these things know if this was not act I

1175
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:14,680
TF technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

1176
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:16,710
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> cleaner problem because I tu and</font>

1177
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:19,960
other organizations but they build

1178
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:22,660
technologies build<font color="#CCCCCC"> o</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am as a first level</font>

1179
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:24,520
thing into each of them and therefore

1180
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:27,160
it's clear what they actually don't tie

1181
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:35,950
together ITF technologies don't do that

1182
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:42,070
now they're loosely coupled I agree with

1183
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:45,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jeff characterization of that so far in</font>

1184
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:51,219
too many<font color="#E5E5E5"> occasions we left Oh am hanging</font>

1185
01:12:45,010 --> 01:12:53,020
as a abandoned child something like I

1186
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:57,550
can compare only to the mid work that

1187
01:12:53,020 --> 01:13:02,400
you know being very late always but at

1188
01:12:57,550 --> 01:13:05,320
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time for new encapsulations and</font>

1189
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:09,700
that's something that would hope well

1190
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:13,240
I'm may be relevant that work on<font color="#CCCCCC"> sfc</font>

1191
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:16,059
beer and there are three as that's where

1192
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:20,760
we try to come up with a comprehensive

1193
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:27,570
OEM mechanisms in parallel to doing on

1194
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:31,720
networking technology so where I think

1195
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:34,990
something like lime has challenges is to

1196
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:37,900
build that base model if they'll get

1197
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:39,639
this with some other organization the

1198
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:42,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">underlying base models would already be</font>

1199
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:44,020
there oh and I do you have circuits and

1200
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:45,040
you know they have the only important

1201
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:47,320
circuits and all the stuff that builds

1202
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:49,870
on top of the circuits the layers just

1203
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:53,290
keep on building up what we do not have

1204
01:13:49,870 --> 01:13:55,900
an ietf no spec and sfc as an example

1205
01:13:53,290 --> 01:13:59,290
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is effectively going to be a IP</font>

1206
01:13:55,900 --> 01:14:02,920
technology there's no IP technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> OEM</font>

1207
01:13:59,290 --> 01:14:04,510
that we can build on top of so we're we

1208
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:05,559
don't have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same foundation that the</font>

1209
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:08,050
other organizations

1210
01:14:05,559 --> 01:14:10,300
and that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right there i</font>

1211
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:11,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">think is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really the thing that line has</font>

1212
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:14,489
been fighting with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire time is</font>

1213
01:14:11,829 --> 01:14:17,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">successful yeah well I'm is trying to</font>

1214
01:14:14,489 --> 01:14:23,949
find some commonality among things that

1215
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:26,169
aren't really common<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so going back</font>

1216
01:14:23,949 --> 01:14:28,419
to next steps um there's the piece of

1217
01:14:26,169 --> 01:14:33,839
abstraction that's the easy part<font color="#E5E5E5"> now how</font>

1218
01:14:28,419 --> 01:14:36,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">to tackle the augmentation problem um I</font>

1219
01:14:33,839 --> 01:14:39,010
thought we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a solution that we'd</font>

1220
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:45,789
agreed to that was to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> rid of the</font>

1221
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:50,169
references to specific oam rfcs and just

1222
01:14:45,789 --> 01:14:52,239
wait for other working groups to augment

1223
01:14:50,169 --> 01:14:53,889
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lung data model does everybody agree</font>

1224
01:14:52,239 --> 01:15:00,280
that that's what we agreed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this</font>

1225
01:14:53,889 --> 01:15:01,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting is anyone wait does anyone not</font>

1226
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:04,030
agree that that's what we're we agreed

1227
01:15:01,599 --> 01:15:06,999
deal does anyone agree remember the

1228
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:10,389
agreement differently<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'll assume I</font>

1229
01:15:06,999 --> 01:15:12,879
got it right then so i'll be looking for

1230
01:15:10,389 --> 01:15:16,709
a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> rev of the connection less draft</font>

1231
01:15:12,879 --> 01:15:22,479
pretty quickly like soon after

1232
01:15:16,709 --> 01:15:25,379
Beethoven's birthday yes and with any

1233
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:27,669
luck we can send that to last call in

1234
01:15:25,379 --> 01:15:32,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">january-february and send it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the iesg</font>

1235
01:15:27,669 --> 01:15:33,639
by next time and probably the<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection</font>

1236
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:38,589
oriented one should<font color="#CCCCCC"> go soon after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1237
01:15:33,639 --> 01:15:43,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">no okay do we need a online editing</font>

1238
01:15:38,589 --> 01:15:43,859
session in January a interim

1239
01:15:47,499 --> 01:15:57,978
should I take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a no authors do we</font>

1240
01:15:51,530 --> 01:16:02,929
need not an interim in January I guess

1241
01:15:57,979 --> 01:16:05,329
not well in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> case um we have a path</font>

1242
01:16:02,929 --> 01:16:07,760
forward I know this has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a difficult</font>

1243
01:16:05,329 --> 01:16:13,429
meeting thank you all for bearing with

1244
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:16,820
it see you all wherever we're meeting

1245
01:16:13,429 --> 01:16:25,090
next time Tom where are we meeting next

1246
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:25,090
time Chicago cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay see you all there</font>

1247
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:34,989
and who has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the blue sheets</font>

1248
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:33,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">hey ok who are you to be that's ok</font>

1249
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:44,620
frustrated to my comments well you're

1250
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:48,519
talking about the augmentation ones or

1251
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:49,690
the involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lisa jerseys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok I thought</font>

1252
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:51,280
that was in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> agreement we just</font>

1253
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:55,450
rattled off that we would not let the

1254
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:58,330
RSI I send them one years in before they

1255
01:17:55,450 --> 01:18:02,010
still they change now let me hit that

1256
01:17:58,330 --> 01:18:02,010
you make it clear
