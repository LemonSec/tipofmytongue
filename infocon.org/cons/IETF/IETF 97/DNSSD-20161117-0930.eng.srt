18
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,010
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know where the etherpad is</font>

19
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,090
it's it's always in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group</font>

20
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,890
air if you just search<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the working</font>

21
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:26,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">group name it's followed by status you</font>

22
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:29,988
will typically find it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> google and</font>

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,989
it's on the agenda to thank you Bob

24
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:37,500
which we can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> which we can yes so</font>

25
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">again a few of the info pages so if you</font>

26
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,739
have the slide deck there you can follow

27
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,269
those terms of where we are with the

28
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,130
various<font color="#E5E5E5"> documents that the working</font>

29
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:49,350
groups working on we obviously have the

30
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:54,170
requirements document that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> published</font>

31
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:58,519
some time ago now dns SD hybrid

32
00:02:54,170 --> 00:03:01,140
stewardess<font color="#CCCCCC"> conley applied the updates</font>

33
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,420
plus a couple of extra ones that were

34
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:07,350
done yesterday are things are actually

35
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,790
now on 05 rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 for Stuart's</font>

36
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:12,390
just going to very briefly present on

37
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:14,640
that we think it's done modulo a couple

38
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,200
of comments and possible thought about

39
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,880
what we're actually calling this and

40
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">Stuart will talk about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shortly</font>

41
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,940
otherwise we expect is push that upward

42
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:29,010
towards publication it does have

43
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:32,070
dependencies though on DNS push and that

44
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:36,840
in turn has a dependency on the DNS op

45
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:38,519
work on the signaling DNS signaling so

46
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,620
everything all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

47
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,570
have to be published together but that

48
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,560
shouldn't stop us starting the process

49
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:49,590
of putting things before the OSG the

50
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,480
mdns dns interop is done we're just

51
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:55,140
waiting on a shepherd right up for that

52
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,060
for that to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the rsg</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> view that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

53
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,920
be quite soon there and then the other

54
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">two pieces of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work that we have that we</font>

55
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,140
will be hearing about today other work

56
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,750
on dns SD privacy so that's now been

57
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:10,290
split into two documents both being

58
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,270
conducted in this working group so the

59
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:15,030
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of high-level privacy document and</font>

60
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:17,430
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the specific document on head</font>

61
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:21,230
pairing works for the privacy protocol

62
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:24,660
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've looking at both of those today</font>

63
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:26,790
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> christian is somewhere in</font>

64
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,710
a plane right now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> daniel it's three</font>

65
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,860
a.m. in the morning so neither of them

66
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,630
could present so either myself or we

67
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,680
might have Ralph presenting remotely for

68
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:40,170
that one just to see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I'll see</font>

69
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:41,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ralph is now on me TECA yeah good so</font>

70
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,740
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we are with everything</font>

71
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,650
things are progressing what we want to

72
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> achieve today first is just to</font>

73
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:52,409
round off anything left with a hybrid

74
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,480
proxy before we push that one up figure

75
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">out also what's left to be done with dns</font>

76
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,520
push and to get an update on where we

77
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,640
are with dns<font color="#E5E5E5"> signaling as I said that's</font>

78
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">being taken to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS op group so we</font>

79
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,940
have close collaboration going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on for</font>

80
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:11,549
that one that was presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Monday or</font>

81
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,850
Tuesday you know tuesday<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not in</font>

82
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,140
short it is today sorry so that that's

83
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,080
progressing or<font color="#CCCCCC"> here a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lamb</font>

84
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:21,120
summary of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that from stuart today and</font>

85
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll also discuss that the privacy work</font>

86
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,440
so we've got some slides from<font color="#E5E5E5"> christian</font>

87
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:30,390
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> daniel and we'll just run through</font>

88
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,850
those quickly we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have Ted giving a</font>

89
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:35,770
short talk on his ideas for stateful

90
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:39,680
multi-link extensions as well

91
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,760
I think if you have time at the end you

92
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,110
might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have it just a quick</font>

93
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,300
review of where we are with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

94
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">milestones which is as with many working</font>

95
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,419
groups a little bit behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you</font>

96
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,520
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a look at those and consider</font>

97
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:51,109
where we might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go after we've</font>

98
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:56,870
done the work that you've got before<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

99
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:58,780
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so agenda bashing this is the</font>

100
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,520
plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> for today we've got 90 minutes</font>

101
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:04,460
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can keep that to schedule</font>

102
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:12,620
so any points about the agendas have you

103
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:15,979
unhappy with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay great so first</font>

104
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:25,990
thing is over to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stuart for the hybrid</font>

105
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:36,229
proxy which is all that one not that one

106
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:45,320
that one again okay it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good to</font>

107
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:49,510

know anything about macs right that's

112
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,638
the best possible tech support I could

113
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,639
have

114
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,850

117
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:11,490
USB stick is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> May could it be a</font>

118
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:16,010
battery thing do you have yours with you

119
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,010
could maybe one or Tim's got one as well

120
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:54,380
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say for its back and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

121
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:56,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">like we had a bunch of changes during</font>

122
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,840
last call I was a bit slow making those

123
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:02,300
updates apologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that my attention</font>

124
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:05,060
got drawn off finishing the push

125
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:08,329
notification document which then got

126
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:13,369
split up into two documents with the

127
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:16,280
session signaling but I finally made all

128
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,660
the efforts all the updates I think all

129
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,079
the edits have been made for the

130
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:28,939
comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were received and that is</font>

131
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:30,890
now done so next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I didn't get all</font>

132
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,410
the changes made in time for the draft

133
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,970
deadline two weeks ago so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> finished</font>

134
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,880
that this week and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was submitted</font>

135
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:43,480
yesterday and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all complete except</font>

136
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,480
for one question for the group next one

137
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:52,040
in continuing<font color="#E5E5E5"> are developing this we</font>

138
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:56,839
have run into an interesting new use

139
00:09:52,040 --> 00:10:00,620
case and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to describe that the way</font>

140
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:03,020
the hybrid proxy works right now is it's

141
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:07,310
a proxy on the network that<font color="#CCCCCC"> does queries</font>

142
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:08,960
on your behalf and it's analogous to me

143
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,599
picking up the phone and calling you and

144
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,160
saying I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the office right now</font>

145
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,870
can you bring up the printer browser and

146
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:19,490
tell me what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see and you're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

147
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:22,060
query on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my behalf we have also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

148
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:25,790
looking at scenarios where the

149
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:28,099
complementary solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense which</font>

150
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:30,770
is where a device that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is offering</font>

151
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:35,060
services wants those to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be visible on</font>

152
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:38,680
remote network the use case here is

153
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:40,729
things like 6lowpan mesh networks where

154
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,910
multicast is not supported in a

155
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:46,250
reasonable way and the hybrid proxy has

156
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:49,040
currently defines<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's those nodes on</font>

157
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:51,680
the mesh use unicast queries to discover

158
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,410
what services are available say on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

159
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,829
home Wi-Fi network but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if one of those</font>

160
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:58,550
know

161
00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:00,980
wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to offer a service then you'd be</font>

162
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:03,890
nice if it could cause the network and

163
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:06,680
say I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the multicast cloud</font>

164
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:08,810
here but can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertise the service</font>

165
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,790
on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> behalf this is my IP address I'm</font>

166
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:14,869
reachable by unicast I just can't

167
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:17,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">participate in multicast and we will be</font>

168
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:20,720
writing a draft to describe that it's a

169
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:22,729
similar kind of mechanism you make a

170
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,760
connection you<font color="#E5E5E5"> send requests the proxy</font>

171
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:28,100
advertisers on your behalf what I

172
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,530
realized<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that we may be running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

173
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,930
a confusing terminology thing so what

174
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:35,510
I'm suggesting is we call the current

175
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,550
thing the discovery proxy and we call

176
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,470
the new thing that advertising proxy and

177
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,910
then nobody will get confused I'm

178
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,410
raising it here<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

179
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:45,350
calling this hybrid proxy for a long

180
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:48,110
time so if anybody is really wedded to

181
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,910
that name I don't to feel like with

182
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're pulling the rug out from under</font>

183
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,839
your feet at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last minute but if</font>

184
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,120
there's no objection to that I'm

185
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:59,240
proposing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we switch that name before we</font>

186
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:02,270
send it to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knitting nodding</font>

187
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:07,430
and smiled I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing any any cons</font>

188
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:09,560
and I question the ribbons so you would

189
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">recall it discovery proxy might you call</font>

190
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:15,739
it hybrid discovery proxy so the hybrid

191
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:20,630
is still there is that yeah is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

192
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:23,660
to discovery prophecy<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok right ok so i</font>

193
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:25,340
think we probably have a wee humming or

194
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,640
showing hands what's your preference um

195
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:30,350
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so cool let's let's do too um let's</font>

196
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:35,810
do a hum for folks who want to change

197
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:37,820
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> name to discovery proxy let's do a</font>

198
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:41,089
chin I harm if we want to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font>

199
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:43,400
something else there we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have it then</font>

200
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:46,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">leave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is is leave as is or leave as is</font>

201
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:51,160
if I'm for anybody wants to leave as is

202
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was unanimous I was a good hum</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

203
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:59,120
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard agreement in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IHF on</font>

204
00:12:53,780 --> 00:13:00,439
anything ok so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're done with</font>

205
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:06,190
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's that was the last</font>

206
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,190
slide on that ok I try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

207
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:26,950
next up push fast nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right ok</font>

208
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:34,869
that's the intro and presenting this on

209
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:37,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">behalf my name i co-authored tom this</font>

210
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:41,350
got derailed a little bit couple of

211
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:43,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">ATF's ago our ray Bellus pointed out</font>

212
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,480
something which was a good point which

213
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,130
is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> document conflated a lot of</font>

214
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,050
details about how you manage a long live

215
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:54,160
session with the details of how you

216
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:57,279
subscribe for change notifications and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

217
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,860
agreed with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis it does delay</font>

218
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,980
things a little bit but we agreed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

219
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:09,550
split it out into two documents which we

220
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:13,980
did and the new push message that the

221
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:17,649
new session signaling draft describes a

222
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:21,070
new message format and the push draft

223
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:22,930
has been rewritten to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use that new</font>

224
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,899
mechanism a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the stuff about</font>

225
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:27,130
session lifetime and session termination

226
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:29,350
has been moved into the session

227
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:32,529
signaling draft which is where it

228
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:36,959
belongs so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> clean it did result</font>

229
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:36,959
in a bunch of rewriting in the document

230
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,980
despite a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of texts moving out of</font>

231
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,750
the document it's still the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

232
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:51,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">of pages because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i added some packet</font>

233
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:54,130
diagrams so it came out the same in the

234
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,720
two weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> since that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> submitted we've</font>

235
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,370
been working on implementing the new

236
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,670
stuff and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> realized we have an</font>

237
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:04,089
oversight minor thing which i'll fix the

238
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:07,240
reconfirm message gives the name type

239
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:10,630
and domain that the receiver is

240
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:15,339
disputing the validity of we need to add

241
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:17,709
the our data because the the receiver

242
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:19,059
needs to say which particular record is

243
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:22,059
disputing

244
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:23,738
if if a multi-homed host has three<font color="#CCCCCC"> IP</font>

245
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:25,329
addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what is not reachable it's</font>

246
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:27,429
only that one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in question it's</font>

247
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:30,248
not all of the addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> so minor</font>

248
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:32,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">oversight I will fix that hopefully in</font>

249
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:34,929
the next few days and that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

250
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:37,029
submitted and then that document should

251
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:39,189
be done just pending the final

252
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:40,959
discussion on the session signaling

253
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:47,079
which is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next thing for us to talk</font>

254
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:48,518
about so before we move to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next one</font>

255
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:53,998
are there any questions or<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments on</font>

256
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:53,999
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's good nice and simple</font>

257
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:13,080
this is the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated one we have</font>

258
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:14,430
six co-authors on this document<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font>

259
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,620
a lot of people were interested in

260
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:26,189
session signaling it's been in the back

261
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:27,870
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people's minds for a while the the</font>

262
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:30,420
main motivation here is managing long

263
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:33,950
long live connections Sarah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have</font>

264
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:36,719
been talking this week and<font color="#CCCCCC"> realized that</font>

265
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:39,329
that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> people talk about long live</font>

266
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,550
connections there are a couple of

267
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:45,469
different scenarios<font color="#E5E5E5"> which are not</font>

268
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:49,649
exactly the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same one is a dns server</font>

269
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:51,450
doing traditional one-shot queries and

270
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:53,790
it was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep the connection open just</font>

271
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:55,050
for efficiency it's done<font color="#CCCCCC"> a query there</font>

272
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,360
might be another one coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a couple</font>

273
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">seconds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it saves tearing down the</font>

274
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,149
connection making you want especially

275
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:05,550
when TLS is used it saves the TLS set up

276
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:08,099
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other use case is for push</font>

277
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:09,409
notifications which we care about where

278
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:11,339
you want to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> the connection up</font>

279
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,470
because you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a long day of operation</font>

280
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:15,990
running and you're expecting to get

281
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,880
notifications of interesting events that

282
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,679
is not just an idle connection that

283
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,569
you're keeping around for convenience

284
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,939
it's an active connection that you're

285
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:26,280

287
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,200
you actually get those push

288
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:33,660
notifications when they come so we have

289
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,320
to have some wording that reconciles

290
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:40,260
those two use cases and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

291
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:45,149
the section signaling meets the needs of

00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:54,210
signaling document is that array are

295
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:56,940
particularly advocated for a truncated

296
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:59,280
header we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need the num questions</font>

299
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:10,470
other people have argued that they

300
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:13,199
should all be there with value<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 because</font>

301
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:16,490
it makes pausing with TCP dump easier

00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:22,658
you make their comments at the mic right

304
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:22,658
sorry thanks you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get upgrade</font>

305
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,248
yeah sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> put aboard a rebel something</font>

306
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:30,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">I actually would still prefer to have</font>

307
00:18:28,249 --> 00:18:31,909
the extra eight bytes there there's my

308
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,299
colleague mark andrews who really the

310

00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:44,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">things they're a good I sment on both</font>

312
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:48,919
sides which makes it the hardest one the

313
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:51,559
result because either would work<font color="#E5E5E5"> um mark</font>

00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,730
is um remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's on me check IM he may</font>

317
00:18:54,619 --> 00:19:00,529
carry on shooting this is being

318
00:18:56,269 --> 00:19:02,299
discussed on<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns off I int accepted i</font>

319
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:09,919
think i just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the little</font>

320
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:13,190
ghosts yeah I'm here um basically for

321
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:17,869
for dns you have to have the opcode the

322
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:19,669
our code and the QR bit there if we

323
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:22,580
don't have anything for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those extra four</font>

324
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:24,710
bytes I'd fill them up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway but</font>

325
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:29,029
you aren't required to keep them as

326
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:31,009
councils they can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything if you if</font>

327
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:33,649
it really depends on<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the op code is</font>

328
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:36,169
going to do and what extra stuff you're

329
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:40,428
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have shoved in there if it's</font>

330
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:42,169
got it has got stuff in there dude

331
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:44,749
normal use they don't have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

332
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:47,389
countess or stuff like that you just

333
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:50,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">want at least 12 bytes but the head the</font>

334
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:51,949
head of this OP code could be four bytes

335
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:57,470
as long as the payload is over 20 bytes

336
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:59,090
12 or more bites that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes sense yes it</font>

337
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:01,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">does so it sounds like we have some</font>

338
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:03,230
editing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document to do I did the</font>

339
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">last round of editing on this document</font>

340
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,759
and it sounds like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

341
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:09,559
misunderstood the opinions that other

342
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,240
people were expressing so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to</font>

343
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:13,249
go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the standard 12</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bite header</font>

344
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,559
and there's no objection to that I think

345
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:17,740
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a bunch people happy and</font>

346
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:21,769
maybe remove some of the controversy

347
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:24,559
yeah the the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last eight bytes can be</font>

348
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:29,029
payload though they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be</font>

349
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:30,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">countess they can be anything I think it</font>

350
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:34,159
makes it very difficult then when

351
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,289
you have variable length tlv payloads if

352
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,029
they happen to be too short then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

353
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:40,820
have to add extra padding to make them

354
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:47,059
up to the 12 bytes so it's got out of

355
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:49,939
butter what is only one till they dapat

356
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:52,460
if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to beat anything so it's a</font>

357
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,440
minimum just saying a minimum size is

358
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,779
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all we set them all 20 issue what</font>

359
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:02,450
if you want it's it's just Taylor it's

360
00:20:56,779 --> 00:21:04,820
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pad either way I think if we set</font>

361
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:08,210
them all to<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero and then have</font>

362
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:10,580
additional stuff after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that then things</font>

363
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:13,580
like TCP dump and Wireshark will just

364
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:15,740
show us an empty<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS message with some</font>

365
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:18,350
mysterious data tacked on the end and

366
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,629
then maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> later the parser will be</font>

367
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:23,209
updated to understand that if we say

368
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:26,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the eight bytes have to be there</font>

369
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:28,249
but they can be used<font color="#CCCCCC"> for anything I that</font>

370
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:31,159
seems like it might be confusing because

371
00:21:28,249 --> 00:21:34,809
we have already in the push notification

372
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:37,909
draft we have requests and responses

373
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:40,428
defined and some of the responses are

374
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:43,429
nothing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the our code to indicate</font>

375
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:48,289
success or failure and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes out as</font>

376
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:52,039
being a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4-byte tlv because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's to bite</font>

377
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:56,029
type<font color="#CCCCCC"> two bites are length and the length</font>

378
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:59,480
is zero and there's no data so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've also</font>

379
00:21:56,029 --> 00:22:03,710
looted I'd be gone on to have a link

380
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:05,809
length field after the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first after the</font>

381
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:10,269
first four<font color="#CCCCCC"> bytes I just got your payload</font>

382
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:14,269
name the title the TLB so that you got

383
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:20,090
internal consistency on the packet on

384
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:22,549
the message well the tlv is type length

385
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:24,408
value and if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no value then the</font>

386
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:27,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">V part of that is missing it just</font>

387
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:29,990
becomes a TL and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> x 2 bytes and</font>

388
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:35,059
that's not big enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 12</font>

389
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:38,360
minimum that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're yep this is absurd I</font>

390
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:41,539
think you know our thinking in some of

391
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,758
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tale days but yeah that's that</font>

392
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:46,129
neither humid it's like about

393
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:48,619
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> blingo yeah let me deal with this</font>

394
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:50,509
later<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right here yeah that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

395
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:52,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">bike shed on the specific details now</font>

396
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:55,039
we've got some ideas on this one and

397
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,019
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens why shot will need</font>

398
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,239
updating so it's fairly moved whether

399
00:22:57,019 --> 00:23:02,720
it's done after insisting header or

400
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:04,100
defining the current bites what marks

401
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,889
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said about than even be a minimum</font>

402
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,059
12 bytes in any DNS packets it was a new

403
00:23:06,889 --> 00:23:12,350
one on me so that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to take</font>

404
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:19,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">into account anyway right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good the</font>

405
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:22,849
next like yes next slide so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

406
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:25,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">question if we add the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> full-length fills</font>

407
00:23:22,849 --> 00:23:26,928
back in then the details of this

408
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:30,070
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> change but the question is</font>

409
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:34,009
still there<font color="#E5E5E5"> but as currently written</font>

410
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:36,979
with no additional records section there

411
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:42,009
is no way to add a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tea sig</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or an eating</font>

signaling control messages themselves if

419
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:05,539
they don't have additional records then

420
00:24:01,729 --> 00:24:08,599
they can't have these things and that I

421
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:13,129
offer as an open question to the

422
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:14,989
community this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS off work group</font>

423
00:24:13,129 --> 00:24:17,299
document so it's being discussed there

424
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:21,200
if anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> here has any opinions on this</font>

425
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:23,090
then please weigh in on the list there

426
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,729
is no arguments that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need t</font>

433
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,809
alive option but the session signaling

434
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:46,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep alive value supersedes that so you</font>

shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the edenists or a</font>

438
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:55,160
that argument makes sense except this<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,950
avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic analysis so maybe we would</font>

444
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,580
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to do padding on the</font>

445
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:13,850
session signaling as well and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do padding do we have to define a</font>

00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:19,129
separate padding tlv which could be fine

448

right<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could say for every eating is</font>

zero option that applies to session

450
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:25,250
signaling we define the corresponding

451
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:28,730
session signaling tlv with similar

452
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:32,120
semantics or we define a generic way of

453
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:34,250
carrying any<font color="#CCCCCC"> eating a zero option with a</font>

455
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:38,870
apply and in particular eating a zero

456
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,520
keeper like must not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> used because it</font>

457
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:44,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">would conflict with session</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> segment keep</font>

458
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:46,550
alive so this is another open question

459
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,500
I'm not presenting any answers here I'm

460
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:51,040
letting<font color="#CCCCCC"> people know that this is an</font>

00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:54,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">issue that needs to be answered before</font>

462
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:56,149
session signaling can progress which

463
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,429
means push is waiting for it which means

464
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:01,160
discovery property is waiting for it so

465
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:03,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to come</font>

00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're the interesting thing at the</font>

469
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:14,180
this is the NS push for DNS SD but there

470
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,100
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be other use cases for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

473
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,420
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking for a use case draft but I</font>

474
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:25,550
think the interesting thing will be to

475
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,260
see what type of other uses people start

476
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:30,710
to come up with once this is more widely

477
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:32,690

<font color="#E5E5E5">flexibility is probably good but yeah</font>

479
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,110
the place to discuss all this is Indiana

480
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,790
so we can have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little discussion here</font>

year there are semantics it has some

493
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:18,139
strange characteristics I see this as

<font color="#E5E5E5">completely superseding that in terms of</font>

507
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:49,460
if the signaling is part of DNS then I

508
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:51,260
think the record<font color="#E5E5E5"> should pretty much look</font>

509
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,030
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of it because we can't</font>

510
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,500

capabilities within the other mechanism

513
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:02,060
i think from an implementer point of

514
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,830
view if it's just an extent it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

515
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,899
extension effectively so let's make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

516
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:09,980
look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of DNS and not</font>

517
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:11,360
suddenly slip in 20 under these you know

518
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,090
requests or session establishment

519
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,860
messages suddenly he doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like</font>

520
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,389
DNS messages for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of your</font>

521
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:20,300
implementation you've got to drop into a

522
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:23,030
whole separate code path it's just a gut

523
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:25,700
reaction thing but it sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

524
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:29,540
hearing broad agreement that we should

525
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:31,970
use the standard 12 bite header and then

526
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:35,240
the question is do we say that the four

527
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:38,420
counts must be<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero or do we allow you</font>

528
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,160
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put questions and answers in these</font>

529
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:43,370
messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> and another interesting</font>

530
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is if the additional record</font>

531
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:49,639
count is there for the purpose of

532
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:51,560
allowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> ed in at 0 and T sig TC is</font>

533
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,050
normally the last thing you add to a

534
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:56,600
packet because you sign all the contents

535
00:28:54,050 --> 00:29:00,350
of the packet but in this structure the

536
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:05,090
TL<font color="#CCCCCC"> v's would come after the additional</font>

537
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:07,550
records so that's a little NIT that we'd

538
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:09,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is if we're tacking</font>

539
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,820
stuff on the end of the packet then the

540
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:14,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">t sick is no longer the last thing in</font>

541
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:18,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">the packet so but if it's running over</font>

542
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,400
TLS over<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP then maybe T sig is</font>

543
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,400
redundant

544
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:35,340
okay next time another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

545
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,689
tricky questions because the hardest

546
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,428
questions answer the ones that don't

547
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:43,309
really matter so people<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always come</font>

548
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:45,929
up and argue both sides right now the

549
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:47,580
session signaling document says every

550
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:50,580
request must be matched with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:53,879
response even if the responses empty and

552
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:56,668
really has no meaning are right now in

553
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,710
the push draft it says that<font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font>

556
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,399
there really is no response that would

00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:07,139
make any sense right<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client doesn't</font>

get to say yes or no<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether it likes</font>

the update it's just it's being informed

560
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:17,130
so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> coin toss I if I had an</font>

561

563
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,178

00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,179
timer to fire so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually giving it a</font>

568
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:36,330
reply to send might make the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP stack</font>

569
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:38,730
happier so it's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these 50 50</font>

570
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:40,260
things by raising here as an<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue that</font>

571
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:42,149
we're going to hopefully resolve in the

572
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,830
next few weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if anybody feels</font>

573
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:45,719
strongly now is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to weigh in on</font>

574
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:49,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and if you don't remain blissfully</font>

575
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:57,600
quiet and we'll pick one okay since my

576
00:30:49,100 --> 00:31:00,629
next and then the third one again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope</font>

577
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,399
will take the form of just simple

578
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:05,039
textual changes in the document i

579
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:08,639
mentioned earlier that we have these to

580
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:13,679
yo use cases that seem the same but

581
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:16,289
maybe aren't and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling with the</font>

582
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:20,940
discussions we've had this week that it

583
00:31:16,289 --> 00:31:23,370
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be worth the keep alive reply from</font>

584
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:27,690
the server having to time fields in it

585
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:30,120
and one is the idle<font color="#E5E5E5"> timeout which is</font>

586
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:31,770
saying if you have no operations to do

587
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,739
and you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeping the connection</font>

588
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,870
around for the sake of it then please

589
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't keep it more</font>

590
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:39,709
ten seconds because i'm a busy server

591
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:43,490
and I don't want millions of connections

592
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:45,230
for no reason the other value is if you

593
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:47,660
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an active subscription and you</font>

594
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,309
don't lose the nap mapping this is the

595
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,700
in full of keeper lives you should send

596
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:54,020
to keep the connection life and

597
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:57,140
decoupling the idle timeout from the

598
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:58,670
keepalive interval seems like it's a

599
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,530
good idea because they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

600
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:04,130
thing and right now they're described as

601
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:08,750
if they were the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing yeah okay</font>

602
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:11,179
that makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great any other</font>

603
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:15,350
questions on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that or any of the other</font>

604
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:17,420
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stuart's presented okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great so</font>

605
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:22,189
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of it in oh sorry</font>

606
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:23,780
Bernie you yeah yeah Bernie volts I just

607
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:26,780
wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> point out on the previous</font>

608
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:30,080
slide that<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP arguments is kind of not</font>

609
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:31,910
because again the reply has to be echoed

610
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,889
back you know has to be act and stuff so

611
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:35,660
you're really not winning anything so

612
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,220
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know i would</font>

613
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,140
remove that argument because it doesn't

614
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:41,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter the only benefit you might have</font>

615
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:43,670
is that you know if the connection has

616
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:45,740
gone down not getting a reply might give

617
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:48,500
you know if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> client</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is expecting a</font>

618
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,970
timeout you know sensor requests and

619
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,100
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just back up gonna make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

620
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:56,300
understood<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you said when you said</font>

621
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:59,480
the argument uh about the TCP ack and

622
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:02,300
stuff because you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you send if it</font>

623
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:05,150
sends a request right right and then if

624
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:07,100
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> send ever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> part you know TCP is</font>

625
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:09,080
going to act at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the low level anyway so</font>

626
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:12,110
if what you're saying if I think white

627
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,760
is a few extra bytes along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that act</font>

628
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:15,469
doesn't make a big difference well the

629
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,730
Act may come even before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

630
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:19,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">bites and the problem is there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

631
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:21,290
to be an act back to act the packets

632
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:24,050
that were the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bytes that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whether apply</font>

633
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:27,920
right so you're actually incurring a lot

634
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:30,500
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost to do that so it's not really</font>

635
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:33,200
a good argument for it the the only

636
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,650
benefit<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have is so you're arguing on</font>

637
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">the side of we should not require</font>

638
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:39,860
replies in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cases they're not</font>

639
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,000
necessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not arguing that I'm just</font>

640
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,309
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain that I don't think</font>

641
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">that TCP argument has any water that's</font>

642
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:46,670
all I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say is that that are</font>

643
00:33:44,929 --> 00:33:48,740
that doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> any difference the</font>

644
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,880
only benefit you have by sending the

645
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,400
reply is that it

646
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,960
I could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a short time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out time for</font>

647
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because it knows it's going</font>

648
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get a reply back and so it might</font>

649
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,390
learn that the connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> is down sooner</font>

650
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:01,970
than it would otherwise so that's the

651
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:04,640
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp benefit you would have is if</font>

652
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:06,530
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you know it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the the</font>

653
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">signaling on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP that you have any</font>

654
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:10,009
benefit for because that act the TCP

655
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,050
acts probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to come way before</font>

656
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:16,570
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> act from the server comes and get</font>

657
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:18,290
set you know that the reply<font color="#CCCCCC"> bites okay</font>

658
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:20,000
so it sounds I that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be a good</font>

659
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,580
point just to pop to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off list</font>

660
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,850
and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> just carry on that discussion</font>

661
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:27,500
then great so they think we're done

662
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,969
without the so the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is to it</font>

663
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:33,800
has implicitly promised us a new

664
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:37,790
document as well so the any thoughts on

665
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:39,679
how advertisement proxy or whatever it's

666
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:43,820
going to be called<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to come</font>

667
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:46,340
along more yes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe should have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had a</font>

668
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:48,500
slide listing all the documents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

669
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:53,710
implicitly promising<font color="#E5E5E5"> get more than one</font>

670
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:56,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">are snowballing away they're here so</font>

671
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:59,660
I've been working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on these three the</font>

672
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,970
hybrid<font color="#CCCCCC"> to push the session signaling and</font>

673
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,319
that's been taking up a lot of my time

674
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:07,370
the things that I've got in the back of

675
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">my mind to explore in the coming weeks</font>

676
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:11,359
and months before the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of</font>

677
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:14,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">meeting other advertising proxy that</font>

678
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,890
lets a remote device advertise there is

679
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:20,060
also the thing that we've talked about

680
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:24,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a while which is the discovery proxy</font>

681
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:26,660
right now is sort of a simplified model

682
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:29,210
where each link has its own name and

683
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:31,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">their separate and many people have</font>

684
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:37,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">pointed out the obvious limitations of</font>

685
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:39,950
this and having some way to merge links

686
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:41,840
or combine them so that name conflicts

687
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:44,419
are resolved and three<font color="#CCCCCC"> different links</font>

688
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,750
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> appear as one from the users point</font>

689
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:49,010
of view yeah that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a good thing</font>

690
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:51,470
this is like a Venn diagram<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

691
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:55,420
overlapping things because the

692
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:57,799
advertising proxy could actually provide

693
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:02,570
potentially a tool to solve that other

694
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:03,830
problem because if you have conceptually

695
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:06,050
in your home you

696
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:08,960
have sort of the main Wi-Fi network and

697
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:13,370
then maybe three or four little leaf

698
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:15,200
links around the edge those could all be

699
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:18,049
considered secondary to the main one

700
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:21,379
they could use the advertising proxy so

701
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:23,600
that all services in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> home as well</font>

702
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:27,170
as existing wherever they exist they

703
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:29,480
also request a remote presence on the

704
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:32,960
quotes main<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and then that may</font>

705
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:35,870
network apparently is the place<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all</font>

706
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,940
services are visible any name conflicts

00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:10,970
that's a possibility and that's why the

719
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:16,879
might and prof. has a question utter if

720
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:18,859
you take that now yes get ahead Ralph hi

721
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,740
Stuart hey listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you just</font>

722
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:25,640
described arm sounds like moving a lot

726
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:38,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">of see what the advantages are one way</font>

727
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:41,200
or the other but but is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you see</font>

728
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:44,600
that moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> along a spectrum like better</font>

729
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,129
yes that if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> pursuit this to its</font>

730
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:49,910
logical conclusion you're absolutely

731
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:53,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">right how far along that spectrum we</font>

732
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:55,759
will go in reality is hard for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to</font>

733
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:57,770
predict because many years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

734
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,370
hoping that DNS update to a centralized

735
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:04,280
server would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a widely used solution</font>

736
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:06,940
right and I guessed wrong kid it has not

737
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,410
turned out I still don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a single</font>

it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever reason those vendors</font>

00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:19,789
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with multicast DNS</font>

742
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:21,589
some of the people have been talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

743
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:22,939
this week have heard the story<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

744
00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:24,979
bought a new house and<font color="#CCCCCC"> moved into the</font>

745
00:38:22,939 --> 00:38:28,308

746
00:38:24,979 --> 00:38:30,769
you do and I've been shocked my my the

747
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:32,989
pool controller has a Wi-Fi interface

748

with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bonjour the solar panels have</font>

749
00:38:32,989 --> 00:38:37,039
inverters that have got a Wi-Fi but

750
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:39,408
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a web UI advertise with</font>

754
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:47,689
printers have Bonjour just the amount of

755
00:38:45,499 --> 00:38:49,939
stuff in my house the thermostats where

756
00:38:47,689 --> 00:38:52,368
were you I with Bonjour it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

757
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:56,299
while I was napping you know everything

758
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:58,009
got a web UI with Bonjour and and not a

759
00:38:56,299 --> 00:39:01,249
single one of those has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS update</font>

760
00:38:58,009 --> 00:39:03,049
client so yeah something that

761
00:39:01,249 --> 00:39:08,749
accommodates all those devices is going

762
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:10,219
to be important right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks yeah</font>

763
00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:12,229
it's a little story that stick and I

764
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:15,409
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> night while we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were on having a</font>

765
00:39:12,229 --> 00:39:17,989
beer<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob off in town managed to throw</font>

766
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:21,079
the recording of the beer working group

767
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:22,519
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a television</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the bar in town so we</font>

768
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:26,109
were very popular in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Park in</font>

769
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:31,008
assuring you know the technology works

770
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:34,759
well and actually are talking about

771
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:36,049
future roadmaps what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought one of</font>

772
00:39:34,759 --> 00:39:44,229
the things ralph was going to talk about

773
00:39:36,049 --> 00:39:47,179
is we have been talking about our how

774
00:39:44,229 --> 00:39:49,759
this technology with developing here

775
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:52,039
might actually be helpful for apple's

776
00:39:49,759 --> 00:39:58,039
new campus and other large enterprises

777
00:39:52,039 --> 00:40:02,779
and one of the one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scenarios here</font>

778
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:04,729
is that in a large building you don't

779
00:40:02,779 --> 00:40:06,169
want to discover everything in the whole

780
00:40:04,729 --> 00:40:08,718
organization because that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

781
00:40:06,169 --> 00:40:13,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">ridiculous number and you don't discover</font>

782
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:16,130
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> things on your link because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i might</font>

783
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:18,289
be right at the edge of the boundary and

784
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:19,699
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can discover the stuff that's way</font>

785
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:21,289
over there but not the stuff that's

786
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:23,539
right next<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be on this side because</font>

787
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:26,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm right at the edge of a boundary so</font>

788
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:31,069
some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sliding window model yeah</font>

789
00:40:26,209 --> 00:40:32,629
where I just go for<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I am and 11</font>

790
00:40:31,069 --> 00:40:34,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">segment down the corridor that way and</font>

791
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,529
one second upper corridor that way and

792
00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:41,269
then as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you move around you've got this</font>

793
00:40:36,529 --> 00:40:43,039
sliding window of three and that would

794
00:40:41,269 --> 00:40:45,439
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to think of the</font>

795
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">right term sort of like it's like the</font>

796
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,690
discovery hybrid proxy but I'd call it

797
00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:54,109
an aggregating proxy it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

798
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:55,789
one level up we're with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the discovery</font>

799
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:57,739
props your hybrid proxy now we're

800
00:40:55,789 --> 00:41:00,440
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send a query to</font>

801
00:40:57,739 --> 00:41:02,690
it it does it by multicast on the local

802
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:06,259
network this<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be a similar concept</font>

803
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:09,319
where when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do a discovery to it it</font>

804
00:41:06,259 --> 00:41:11,809
knows which three other discovery

805
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:13,880
proxies to talk to and then it

806
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:15,859
aggregates those three into one result

807
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,589
which it gives back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client so</font>

808
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:19,880
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would save the client doing three</font>

809
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:22,339
separate queries to three different

810
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">properties it would talk to one which</font>

811
00:41:22,339 --> 00:41:26,089
then fans those queries out on its

812
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:28,879
behalf and if there's a hundred clients

813
00:41:26,089 --> 00:41:31,009
doing this the some efficiency in not

814
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,809
having all<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred clients open three</font>

815
00:41:31,009 --> 00:41:34,969
connections each so there may be a

816
00:41:32,809 --> 00:41:37,249
similar thing there for example and on

817
00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:40,190
our campus we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the wireless</font>

818
00:41:37,249 --> 00:41:41,689
there's VLAN pooling happens so you're

819
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:44,660
in a different subnet to the person

820
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,949
stood next to you can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> bonjour to</font>

821
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,879
the device to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the person stood right</font>

822
00:41:45,949 --> 00:41:48,249
next to you because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're in a</font>

823
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,989
different subnet because of the way the

824
00:41:48,249 --> 00:41:54,439
wireless LAN controller provisions the

825
00:41:50,989 --> 00:41:57,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">network so there's other thing yeah man</font>

826
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:00,829
I'm taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and do Stewart I'm not</font>

827
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:03,949
convinced it but I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> convinced that</font>

828
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:06,319
what you're talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> is um let's</font>

829
00:42:03,949 --> 00:42:08,660
say they're sort of what we talked about

830
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:10,369
at the last ITF meeting there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots</font>

831
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,359
of opportunities for taking these

832
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:12,769
building blocks and putting them

833
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:17,150
together in clever ways and now with the

834
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:18,379
advertising proxy concept that's that's

835
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:22,459
another dimension for putting things

836
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:25,489
together<font color="#CCCCCC"> cleverly so I think we did</font>

837
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:27,948
discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in Berlin that well Ralph</font>

838
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:29,989
presented some thoughts towards a

839
00:42:27,949 --> 00:42:31,910
document that he and Tom have said they

840
00:42:29,989 --> 00:42:34,130
may produce soon which would be sort of

841
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:36,410
the usage guidelines for how you deploy

842
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:38,119
this stuff in a campus type environment

843
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:39,440
enterprise environment so some of these

844
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:42,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">things are going to drop out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that I</font>

845
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">think yeah I think that documents like a</font>

846
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:46,490
best current practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> young</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font>

847
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,020
because we're creating a bunch of

848
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:49,640
building blocks and giving people

849
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:51,410
guidance about how to put those blocks

850
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,660
together would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be good yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly that</font>

851
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:56,540
be any thoughts on that Ralph as to

852
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:59,000
whether we might see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that soon on a you</font>

853
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:00,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">and Tom we're discussing it yeah</font>

854
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,930
regrettably Tom and I are both in the

855
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:09,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">same similar situation about our our our</font>

856
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:09,190
support for doing that sort of work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

857
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:15,380
it hasn't percolated to the top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

858
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:19,160
pile but you've caused me to think

859
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:21,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">Stewart the mechanism you just described</font>

860
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:25,149
I think might also have some advantages

861
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:28,790
in terms of configuration administration

862
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:31,270
it's more centrally configured your only

863
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:33,410
you're only doing that definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

864
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,670
overlapping circles in the Venn diagram

865
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:37,460
in one place rather than trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

866
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:39,470
configure it specifically to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font>

867
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,640
clients<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a point but the individual</font>

868
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:44,209
clients in a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different places</font>

869
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:47,210
right and if you if you took the simple

870
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:50,540
descriptors gave and took it to its

871
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:52,430
logical conclusion you could run<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in</font>

872
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:54,170
a very centralized way which for some

873
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:57,080
network operators is the way they like

874
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:59,540
to run things so there would be one big

875
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:02,480
eye and server in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data center all</font>

00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:04,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the clients talk to that server and the</font>

877
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,640
queries they send may serve to tailor

878
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:10,250
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> responses they get and that big iron</font>

one back to the data center and then

887
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,380
that database engine there is

888
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:30,589

892
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:38,480
comes up comes to mind is a very low

00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:43,940
pragmatic level I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there are some</font>

00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:47,420
difficulties<font color="#CCCCCC"> in reconfiguring the list</font>

dynamically as the host moves from from

00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:55,579
from point to point in the network this

898
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:57,979
might I might

899
00:44:55,579 --> 00:45:04,430
add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little new direction to avoid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

900
00:44:57,979 --> 00:45:06,680
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sum I think the way</font>

901
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:08,390
time is at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment now we take that</font>

902
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,999
is I think it's like it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be useful</font>

903
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:12,979
clearly this BCP thing would be a useful

904
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:14,660
document to try and move forward so if

905
00:45:12,979 --> 00:45:16,609
there's potentially one or two authors

906
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:18,799
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room that can help Ralph</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and and</font>

907
00:45:16,609 --> 00:45:21,589
Tom that would be great OPP siege to it

908
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:24,529
has a list of his own I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

909
00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:25,670
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put too much extra load on to do</font>

910
00:45:24,529 --> 00:45:26,989
it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one or two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people in</font>

911
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:29,299
the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> but like to work on that please</font>

912
00:45:26,989 --> 00:45:30,890
let Ralph and Tom now and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally</font>

913
00:45:29,299 --> 00:45:32,630
take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question at the mic and then</font>

914
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:34,308
we'll move on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the next topic Rick</font>

915
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:36,170
Taylor<font color="#E5E5E5"> again very quick point there's</font>

916
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:37,819
another use case for the advertising

917
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:39,049
proxy which i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure we mentioned</font>

918
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:40,819
have been talking about campuses but

919
00:45:39,049 --> 00:45:43,038
actually there's a containerization use

920
00:45:40,819 --> 00:45:45,859
case here where you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a composite</font>

921
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:48,529
device which creates containers for

922
00:45:45,859 --> 00:45:50,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-party applications and the third</font>

923
00:45:48,529 --> 00:45:53,029
party applications can think that

924
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:54,650
there's an advertising proxy there that

925
00:45:53,029 --> 00:45:56,690
is actually advertising out across the

926
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:59,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">network but actually it's a proxy for</font>

927
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:01,749
that container that's then up revving

928
00:45:59,209 --> 00:46:04,038
the advertisement out to the external

929
00:46:01,749 --> 00:46:05,538
advertiser that's then aggregating and

930
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:07,759
throwing that out onto the network so

931
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:10,039
your campus can actually just fit inside

932
00:46:07,759 --> 00:46:13,279
one device which is a huge place i'm

933
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:15,969
looking at it's a nice sunny<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok um</font>

934
00:46:13,279 --> 00:46:24,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very much Stewart so</font>

935
00:46:15,969 --> 00:46:26,869
Ralph used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wear I think you think you</font>

936
00:46:24,769 --> 00:46:29,229
may need to come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the microphone</font>

937
00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:38,869
q Ralph for the next thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you</font>

938
00:46:29,229 --> 00:46:40,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">privacy stuff Wow year we go ok so we</font>

939
00:46:38,869 --> 00:46:45,289
move on now to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns st privacy</font>

940
00:46:40,789 --> 00:46:49,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">workers as a situation has precluded</font>

941
00:46:45,289 --> 00:46:51,559
either christian or<font color="#CCCCCC"> daniel from talking</font>

942
00:46:49,549 --> 00:46:52,819
about christian we had a great plan and

943
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:55,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we realized it was actually the</font>

944
00:46:52,819 --> 00:46:56,989
wrong day wednesday was thursday and

945
00:46:55,309 --> 00:46:58,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">thursdays</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wendys wednesday depending you</font>

946
00:46:56,989 --> 00:47:00,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">either international date line or</font>

947
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:05,180
whatever it is is a is a horrible thing

948
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:07,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so Ralph has kindly agreed to</font>

949
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:09,038
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to this so we can focus on the</font>

950
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:11,960
cherry

951
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:15,289
so we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation about this</font>

952
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:17,809
obviously last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time in Berlin there's</font>

953
00:47:15,289 --> 00:47:20,630
been some movement and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ralph is just</font>

954
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:23,509
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to quickly present the update</font>

955
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:26,470
slides that's Christian and Daniel the

956
00:47:23,509 --> 00:47:29,660
fourth it so look over to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> averages</font>

957
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:30,799
yeah Tim do you want to start by because

958
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:35,210
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be an update</font>

959
00:47:30,799 --> 00:47:37,730
because both my children through<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

960
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:42,140
that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> point a show of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hands</font>

961
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:45,049
who's read the privacy draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

962
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:48,710
that's four hands up there Ralph and

963
00:47:45,049 --> 00:47:51,288
who's read the pairing draw<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hit the ok</font>

964
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:53,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">herring draft we've got about four hands</font>

965
00:47:51,289 --> 00:47:55,309
as well I mean I've obviously read both

966
00:47:53,029 --> 00:47:57,759
so Ralph as well so we've got about six

967
00:47:55,309 --> 00:48:00,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">people in the room that have read these</font>

968
00:47:57,759 --> 00:48:01,400
so yeah I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might need to say a</font>

969
00:48:00,259 --> 00:48:02,960
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more background other</font>

970
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:07,730
otherwise then because other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> went</font>

971
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:09,259
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it may be okay anyway so yeah</font>

972
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:14,140
I've just moved on to slide one I guess

973
00:48:09,259 --> 00:48:18,499
you can see this yeah guys um so what's

974
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:21,470
the big<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture here is Tim make sure I</font>

975
00:48:18,499 --> 00:48:25,089
get this right the there's a decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

976
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:27,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">take the one document for doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS SD</font>

977
00:48:25,089 --> 00:48:30,529
privacy and split it into two documents

978
00:48:27,499 --> 00:48:32,058
keeping data SSD privacy as one document

979
00:48:30,529 --> 00:48:33,470
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the pairing as a second</font>

980
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:35,630
document so now we're at two I don't

981
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:38,629
think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done that that last time</font>

982
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:40,430
had we know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we'd agreed to</font>

983
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:42,170
do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Berlin but it's now happened</font>

984
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:44,450
about the peanut Bell is working group

985
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:47,650
items as well right so that's so that's

986
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:50,149
not happened so the pns SD privacy just

987
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:55,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">to review quickly is motivated by the</font>

988
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:58,549
fact that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns SD generally and</font>

00:48:55,910 --> 00:49:01,730
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> multicast</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS has some</font>

990
00:48:58,549 --> 00:49:04,609
real privacy issue it exposes a lot of

991
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:11,230
information about hosts on a on a

992
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:16,400
network and this this technology from

993
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:18,680
Cristiano<font color="#E5E5E5"> Daniel is an attempt to hide</font>

994
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,609
as much of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information as possible</font>

995
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:27,269
from exposure the basic idea you

996
00:49:21,609 --> 00:49:30,759
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 24 devices that are going to use this</font>

997
00:49:27,269 --> 00:49:34,029
privacy DNS SD version they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

998
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:37,480
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> priority pair with each other have a</font>

999
00:49:34,029 --> 00:49:40,150
have a pre-shared key between<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1000
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:44,470
pairs of devices and then when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they when</font>

1001
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:47,799
a device actually wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do dns SD it</font>

1002
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:52,930
can use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pre-shared keys between the</font>

1003
00:49:47,799 --> 00:49:57,819
privacy enabled devices to hide the dns

1004
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:59,799
SD queries inside TLS and so the this

1005
00:49:57,819 --> 00:50:04,480
first document that the NSS d privacy

1006
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:08,680
document goes into some analysis of ways

1007
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,989
in which<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns SD exposes information that</font>

1008
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:17,009
that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be better not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to expose and</font>

1009
00:50:10,989 --> 00:50:19,349
that it explains the privacy mechanism

1010
00:50:17,009 --> 00:50:24,880
assuming<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's a pairing</font>

1011
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:28,349
mechanism in place so the the changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1012
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,279
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of the document are</font>

1013
00:50:28,349 --> 00:50:31,960
basically to go with just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single</font>

1014
00:50:30,279 --> 00:50:34,390
solution the earlier document had two

1015
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:40,989
possible solutions this goes with just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1016
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:44,348
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution which is a basically a</font>

1017
00:50:40,989 --> 00:50:47,549
two-step solution first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all a client</font>

1018
00:50:44,349 --> 00:50:50,529
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to do some dns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sdd queries</font>

1019
00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:52,779
asks on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network for all of the other</font>

1020
00:50:50,529 --> 00:50:56,140

1021
00:50:52,779 --> 00:50:58,450
discovery service the client then picks

1022
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:01,480
the devices then picks the appropriate

1023
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:03,339
keys for doing the pairwise private

1024
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:06,190
discovery with all those other devices

1025
00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:08,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it has previously paired with it</font>

1026
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:12,970
can use the the privacy service with

1027
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:17,349
this mechanism doesn't address<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

1028
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:24,339
sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of general privacy if if a client</font>

1029
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:26,349
chooses<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do non-private</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dns SD with</font>

1030
00:51:24,339 --> 00:51:27,999
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices with which it is not pair</font>

1031
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:29,619
that's that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy decision on the</font>

1032
00:51:27,999 --> 00:51:32,129
part of the client what this mechanism

1033
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:34,170
does is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> provides a way for doing</font>

1034
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:38,360
the private discovery between devices

1035
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:38,360
that have already paired with each other

1036
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:46,669
and that's basically it is so so that's

1037
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:46,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">big that's that's that change next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font>

1038
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:59,460
right so there's there is a scaling

1039
00:51:55,650 --> 00:52:02,700
issue that the the the way the service

1040
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:05,040
discovery that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy service</font>

1041
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:09,259
discovery servers are advertised is that

1042
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:13,860
each privacy server advertises

1043
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:16,230
essentially all of all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the keys that</font>

1044
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:17,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">it knows about which is essentially</font>

1045
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:20,670
identifiers for all of the parent of my

1046
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:24,090
system knows about so a device that's

1047
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:26,010
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discover a privacy server is</font>

1048
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:28,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get a list of privacy server</font>

1049
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:32,910
devices each one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> which M so it'll get</font>

1050
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:36,950
em privacy server provides service it

1051
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:39,810
will get and keys for each one of those

1052
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:42,839
privacy servers and now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client</font>

1053
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:45,270
has to do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that work to do n times n</font>

1054
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:48,840
amount of work to discover which devices

1055
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:53,250
to compare with and there's a suggestion

1056
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:55,850
to scale this back so that the this

1057
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:59,220
computation only has to be done once

1058
00:52:55,850 --> 00:53:02,100
every five minutes so that rather than

1059
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:06,149
for each discovery getting a new nods

1060
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:08,790
the I've got this<font color="#E5E5E5"> right the the knots</font>

1061
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:13,110
the servers can re-add verte eyes using

1062
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:16,200
the same knots on a with a five minute

1063
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:17,700
interval that way that the client<font color="#CCCCCC"> device</font>

1064
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,169
doesn't have to do the recomputation it

1065
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:21,689
already has the computation and those

1066
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:23,550
which which<font color="#CCCCCC"> Keys it can match up against</font>

1067
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:25,620
and so there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question from the</font>

1068
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:27,920
authors as to whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not this is a</font>

1069
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:30,630
good idea yeah and I think the way

1070
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,980
things yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the way Christian</font>

1071
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:34,910
was saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be implemented</font>

1072
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:37,920
would be by right shifting on the

1073
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:39,299
time-based months so I think Christian

1074
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,730
was also worried as to whether there was

1075
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:45,030
maybe some prior IPR or something on

1076
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:45,960
that type of idea oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think he</font>

1077
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:49,500
was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise</font>

1078
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:51,780
in this security area group so we have

1079
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,849
Christian has put these both of these

1080
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:55,980
drafts to the security area group asking

1081
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:57,390
for feedback that he's got none yet so

1082
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:00,839
I've had a discussion with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Steven</font>

1083
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:02,400
Farrell yesterday and he's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fire</font>

1084
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:04,560
someone else find someone to do in a

1085
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,690
more formal review of this at an early

1086
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:08,520
stage rather than waiting both<font color="#CCCCCC"> doctors</font>

1087
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:09,660
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the isg and then have that we're</font>

1088
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to try and get some feedback on</font>

1089
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:15,480
that just this type of thing sooner

1090
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,799
rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than later okay but yes clearly I</font>

1091
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,810
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether anyone in the room here</font>

1092
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:22,020
has any feel on this as to whether these

1093
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:24,720
type of optimizations are of interest or

1094
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:26,220
the approaches that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

1095
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem if you've got quite a large</font>

1096
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:30,569
scale number of devices of doing a large

1097
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:33,150
number of services I mean you could

1098
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:36,480
imagine if this type of thing caught on

1099
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:38,599
and you're on a campus with a lot of

1100
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:43,770
pairings between devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are</font>

1101
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:46,140
possibly yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd forgotten what the the</font>

1102
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:49,109
practical upper limit is on the number

1103
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:51,390
of keys be advertised in one response

1104
00:54:49,109 --> 00:54:57,150
from the server but you remember what

1105
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:58,560
that look at my words yes I was reading

1106
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:00,859
that last night but I don't remember the

1107
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:03,930
exact number anyway there is a

1108
00:55:00,859 --> 00:55:08,670
reasonable limit because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way the</font>

1109
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:11,990
keys are<font color="#E5E5E5"> cooking the weather yeah I</font>

1110
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:17,960
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that 32 bit too far remember</font>

1111
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:20,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay Oh any other discussion forum</font>

1112
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:22,230
nobody is dashing to the mic at the

1113
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:25,770
moment but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we do need to get</font>

1114
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:29,089
this out there in<font color="#CCCCCC"> sag to actually get</font>

1115
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:31,800
some discussion going there we did have

1116
00:55:29,089 --> 00:55:34,290
the discussion obviously after Berlin as

1117
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,730
to where this work would be done the

1118
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:38,250
trade-off<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if we do it here at least</font>

1119
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:40,770
there should be more interest or<font color="#E5E5E5"> theory</font>

1120
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:42,540
here if we did take it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to suck then</font>

1121
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,980
there would probably be less interest as

1122
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:46,020
witnessed by the fact that no one's

1123
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:49,410
commented on it yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so we do</font>

1124
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:51,750
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to no pun intended push that to get</font>

1125
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:54,750
more review of this work because it's a

1126
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:56,220
interesting be important and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to</font>

1127
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:57,990
get some early comment as to whether the

1128
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:59,578
direction it's heading in is is good

1129
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:01,200
seems so but

1130
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:05,130
some more expert review<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be great</font>

1131
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:07,229
it's a microphone comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> here oh this</font>

1132
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:11,459
is a high office<font color="#CCCCCC"> is heading for Tony I</font>

1133
00:56:07,229 --> 00:56:14,308
via I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> followed means not about</font>

1134
00:56:11,459 --> 00:56:16,410
but one or things that has usually

1135
00:56:14,309 --> 00:56:19,039
doomed these type of efforts is or two

1136
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:21,839
of them are configuration complexity

1137
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:24,180
both implementation kind of complexity

1138
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:26,430
what it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from implementer and this</font>

1139
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:28,440
does seem to be something which require

1140
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:31,950
somebody to taking a substantial amount

1141
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:33,150
of crypto to<font color="#E5E5E5"> good light at least and the</font>

1142
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:36,390
second one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably more</font>

1143
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:39,599
worrisome is how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre configuration</font>

1144
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:42,180
do you need on behalf<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all</font>

1145
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:43,650
participants<font color="#CCCCCC"> because man if you think of</font>

1146
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:47,399
a campus environment you want to

1147
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:50,549
discover printers if you have to

1148
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:52,650
distribute shared secrets to everybody

1149
00:56:50,549 --> 00:56:54,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">that kind of defeats</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the purpose of</font>

1150
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:58,680
service discovery right<font color="#E5E5E5"> right i think</font>

1151
00:56:54,900 --> 00:57:01,079
it's it's it's something where if both

1152
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:03,479
parties wish to communicate this way

1153
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:04,650
then it's incrementally deployable if

1154
00:57:03,479 --> 00:57:07,198
you like so it's not something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

1155
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:09,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">its required so you've got that benefit</font>

1156
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:12,259
that if you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this then you can benefit</font>

1157
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:14,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">from it it's not obviously required</font>

1158
00:57:12,259 --> 00:57:15,449
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because oh yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1159
00:57:14,249 --> 00:57:16,589
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something definitely that the</font>

1160
00:57:15,449 --> 00:57:19,170
working group needs to bear in mind

1161
00:57:16,589 --> 00:57:23,489
though is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> deployment hurdles that we</font>

1162
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:27,269
face<font color="#E5E5E5"> here I'm sorry yes you might take a</font>

1163
00:57:23,489 --> 00:57:31,410
look at a herring documentary<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christian</font>

1164
00:57:27,269 --> 00:57:33,209
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Daniel de- some effort well you got</font>

1165
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:36,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">some slides for that in a moment rough I</font>

1166
00:57:33,209 --> 00:57:37,469
think yeah yeah yeah if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> covering</font>

1167
00:57:36,029 --> 00:57:40,440
it just stuffing these are the factors

1168
00:57:37,469 --> 00:57:42,930
in doing that pairing step and exactly

1169
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">as Tim suggests it's it's incremental</font>

1170
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:47,519
it's look it's like adding up names of

1171
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:51,839
printers<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> available printers</font>

1172
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:54,448
<font color="#CCCCCC">in jerz your your members you don't have</font>

1173
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:59,400
google all over the printers of<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazon</font>

1174
00:57:54,449 --> 00:58:03,920
once you can walk up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a lot of to pair</font>

1175
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:06,269
with errors unlimited as<font color="#E5E5E5"> haunted eight</font>

1176
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,969
yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pairing document describes</font>

1177
00:58:06,269 --> 00:58:11,249
methods of doing that online or even via

1178
00:58:08,969 --> 00:58:13,530
QR codes so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are different ways</font>

1179
00:58:11,249 --> 00:58:14,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">that could be done</font>

1180
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:17,070
again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's where Christian</font>

1181
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:18,810
wants feedback fairly early on as to

1182
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:20,580
which of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> approaches make sense and</font>

1183
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:22,470
what the practical issues are with

1184
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:24,299
actually deploying them again so when

1185
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:27,899
one thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if s is</font>

1186
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:30,990
even remotely feasible is if there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1187
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:33,720
way to leverage existing security

1188
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:36,200
relationships at you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> WPA type of</font>

1189
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:39,569
relationship so easy i'm packing then

1190
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:43,109
you can you might be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1191
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:46,050
do anything manual that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

1192
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:47,910
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Stewart said that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again so I</font>

1193
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:57,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we're done on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that one I'll bring</font>

1194
00:58:47,910 --> 00:59:01,529
up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next like that well yeah yep dns</font>

1195
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:07,890
SD pairing coming up now so again<font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font>

1196
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:11,940
slides in the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i move on to</font>

1197
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:14,370
slide come on<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh this these slides</font>

1198
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:16,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">describe the increment what's happened</font>

1199
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:20,310
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this document since the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> breloom</font>

1200
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:22,680
meeting and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the the the</font>

1201
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:25,820
pairing process is for two devices to

1202
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:30,480
decide they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pair they exchange</font>

1203
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:32,070
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> exchange</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the keys and then confirm</font>

1204
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:39,180
that they've actually exchanged the keys

1205
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:41,550
that they thought they exchanged and the

1206
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:44,250
three-phase photo protocol outlined here

1207
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:49,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">in this slide so that they find each</font>

1208
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:52,530
other they export give the pre-shared

1209
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:56,310
key between them and then they use some

1210
00:59:52,530 --> 01:00:00,060
mechanism similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mechanisms that you</font>

1211
00:59:56,310 --> 01:00:01,320
you you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> in place today for both</font>

1212
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,850
devices that are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pair with</font>

1213
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:05,460
each other display there some

1214
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:06,810
computation based on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key that</font>

1215
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:08,340
was exchanged if they both the same

1216
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:09,600
computation than they then you can

1217
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:15,480
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the key exchange works</font>

1218
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:17,370
successfully so this is tim pointed out

1219
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:21,500
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an incremental process it can be</font>

1220
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:24,330
done pairwise between uh between devices

1221
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:26,250
as needed you don't have to go through

1222
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:28,620
in

1223
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:29,970
set up Perry all the devices you ever

1224
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:31,589
want to you'll ever want to pair with

1225
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:35,100
all at once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can you can just add</font>

1226
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:37,410
additional pairings on<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah as time goes</font>

1227
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:40,230
on although there is in the kind of

1228
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:43,799
scenario that that heading point out

1229
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:47,790
there will be scaling issues on the part

1230
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:50,340
of the the devices that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are providing</font>

1231
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:53,850
the services as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can imagine in a in</font>

1232
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:57,120
a campus with thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of potential</font>

1233
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:59,190
users the printers are going to have to

1234
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,990
maintain keys for thousands of

1235
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:03,270
potentially thousands of users which

1236
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:07,890
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is clearly going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a scaling</font>

1237
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:11,580
issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions let's</font>

1238
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:13,620
go to the next slide yeah I mean as you

1239
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:15,299
in dec just could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be it could just be</font>

1240
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:16,890
Ralph and I on the on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless</font>

1241
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:19,320
network that both run this having

1242
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:22,799
prepared and whenever we come to the

1243
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:24,750
IETF then our discovery and exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

having done that right side another

01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:37,560
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is in one of the documents</font>

1247
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:39,689
is those of us who carry multiple

1248
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:41,370
devices around that are communicating

1249
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:46,860
through a public network right if I've

1250
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:48,990
got both the a Wi-Fi enabled phone and a

1251
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:52,680
laptop and a tablet and they're

1252
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:55,500
communicating across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cross a public</font>

1253
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:58,470
Wi-Fi I can pre I<font color="#E5E5E5"> compare those things</font>

1254
01:01:55,500 --> 01:02:03,420
up pairwise once and then the matter

1255
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:06,240
which public Wi-Fi I get connected to

1256
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:08,490
they will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> private discovery</font>

1257
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:12,000
privacy to enable discovery amongst

1258
01:02:08,490 --> 01:02:13,350
themselves and I don't have to I don't

1259
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,480
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that pairing work each time</font>

1260
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:17,910
that they just use whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> network is</font>

1261
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:24,420
available to to do the privacy service

1262
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:27,660
discovery yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think yeah so</font>

1263
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:30,810
I've moved on to slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 neck yeah and</font>

1264
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:35,399
and this is a detail where Christian

1265
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:39,130
needs to ask for help from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the from the</font>

1266
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:43,940
TLS community<font color="#CCCCCC"> as to exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

1267
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:46,760
how this aspect the this short

1268
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:49,760
authentication string exchange should be

1269
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:53,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">implemented is it is it as part of TLS</font>

1270
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,410
or is it is it as a separate application

1271
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:58,970
so just as with the other one I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1272
01:02:57,050 --> 01:03:00,320
these document the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> documents I</font>

1273
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:02,089
think these documents are baked well

1274
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:04,940
enough that i want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> encourage the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1275
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:08,630
working group to take a close read and

1276
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:11,330
if we can encourage through<font color="#E5E5E5"> stephen to</font>

1277
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:16,160
get the security walks to take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

1278
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:18,340
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be great yeah any TLS</font>

1279
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:22,670
gurus in the room wish to<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment on</font>

1280
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:25,280
what's then<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right no one's</font>

1281
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:28,280
running to them to the microbe<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then</font>

1282
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:31,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">lets me sad last slide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll go to the</font>

1283
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:36,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one right so there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so this</font>

1284
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:36,850
is it's it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS SD adopted document</font>

1285
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:42,440
some next steps as I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked for</font>

1286
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:44,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">review and feedback there needs to be a</font>

1287
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:49,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision about the design and</font>

1288
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:51,950
implementation of the TLS extension and

1289
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:55,130
implementation experience if we can get

1290
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:58,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">that feedback from security we can get</font>

1291
01:03:55,130 --> 01:04:00,410
the implementation experience we should

1292
01:03:58,370 --> 01:04:03,560
be able to move this forward and have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1293
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:06,560
working request call at the next IETF

1294
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:08,299
needing and so I my understanding is

1295
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:11,000
that daniel has been implementing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1296
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:14,000
see all parts of this within a project

1297
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,350
so if anyone else is interested in

1298
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">implementing this as well that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1299
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:20,380
fantastic but we will certainly have

1300
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:26,210
feedback from Daniels implementations by

1301
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:27,920
Chicago next I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think okay that's it ok</font>

1302
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:29,900
Ralph I'm just curious you sat<font color="#CCCCCC"> in front</font>

1303
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:33,080
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all your patents is that what's on</font>

1304
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:39,650
the water though do you have an IPR

1305
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:42,650
disclosure to make yeah not<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1306
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:47,840
thanks very much rough ok clear this

1307
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:51,830
word great so where does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> take us to</font>

1308
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:54,470
I think his head is next so

1309
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:55,790
we've got about 25 minutes left so Ted

1310
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:57,529
you can still have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 minutes</font>

1311
01:04:55,790 --> 01:05:01,370
promised and then we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

1312
01:04:57,530 --> 01:05:05,480
time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little wrap up at the end boy</font>

1313
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:07,609
and if you go okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> wow you got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 so</font>

1314
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:10,480
you're off you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take me back off of hand</font>

1315
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:15,410
upload<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'll press the red button</font>

1316
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:18,320
the eject button we<font color="#E5E5E5"> by Ralph okay Ted</font>

1317
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:20,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I'm here to talk about the</font>

1318
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:23,990
fateful multi-link dns service discovery

1319
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:25,609
puzzle that I submitted a couple of days

1320
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:29,500
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> the deadline or possibly on the</font>

1321
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:33,230
deadline<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would want to say for sure I</font>

1322
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:36,140
just say next is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> liquor isn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1323
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:39,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">amounts thing um that's really small so</font>

1324
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:45,620
uh so basically the idea here is that

1325
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:49,280
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS SD mdns hybrid proxy solution</font>

1326
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:51,680
much better does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't see the</font>

1327
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:54,740
screen yeah that's great perfect you get

1328
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:56,540
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks um so the hybrid proxy</font>

1329
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:58,279
solution is a great solution in the

1330
01:05:56,540 --> 01:06:01,490
sense that it's stateless easy to

1331
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:04,850
implement and so forth but it also isn't

1332
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:07,040
DNS really there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are things the DNS does</font>

1333
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:12,980
that the hybrid proxy model can't do and

1334
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:16,430
so the motivation here is to come up

1335
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:22,910
with a proposal for how to actually

1336
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:25,970
support DNS fully goals extend en SSD

1337
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:28,160
hybrid don't invent something new I<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1338
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:31,240
would be nice to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to populate DNS</font>

1339
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:33,259
zones using service scurry announcements

1340
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:34,759
support standard DNS protocol

1341
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:36,920
infrastructure make service discovery

1342
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:40,130
announcements more secure because right

1343
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:42,110
now they're not at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all secure provide a</font>

1344
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:44,270
means of announcing services for devices

1345
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:49,240
that don't support multicast this is

1346
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:51,350
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stuart talked about and</font>

1347
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:52,970
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this may be the right way to do</font>

1348
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:55,610
that or there may be some better way to

1349
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:57,620
do that but and then eliminate the need

1350
01:06:55,610 --> 01:07:00,110
for regular multicast queries on

1351
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:05,249
networks for multicast is expensive you

1352
01:07:00,110 --> 01:07:07,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">know Wi-Fi next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so um</font>

1353
01:07:05,249 --> 01:07:12,910
unfortunately this is actually a hard

1354
01:07:07,779 --> 01:07:15,190
problem and the end state where we're

1355
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:17,469
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing multicast a lot requires that</font>

1356
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:19,029
pretty much every device its advertising

1357
01:07:17,469 --> 01:07:22,499
service on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network implement the</font>

1358
01:07:19,029 --> 01:07:25,359
new way of doing service advertising<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

1359
01:07:22,499 --> 01:07:26,890
that's a big ask and not likely to

1360
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:34,808
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime soon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's kind of a</font>

1361
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:36,519
disadvantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh obviously it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more me</font>

1362
01:07:34,809 --> 01:07:38,140
it's more work to maintain state and

1363
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:42,038
keep the state accurate than it is to

1364
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:44,859
just cash and allow the stuff in the

1365
01:07:42,039 --> 01:07:45,999
cash to expire naturally it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a huge</font>

1366
01:07:44,859 --> 01:07:49,660
amount more work but it's definitely

1367
01:07:45,999 --> 01:07:54,399
more bookkeeping and you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more</font>

1368
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:56,078
careful<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be correct so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea there</font>

1369
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,969
I guess I didn't really explain the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

1370
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:00,969
there is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that essentially you're</font>

1371
01:07:57,969 --> 01:08:03,460
doing when you when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do dns service</font>

1372
01:08:00,969 --> 01:08:06,489
discovery you store the information in a

1373
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:07,960
DNS zone so so it's essentially been

1374
01:08:06,489 --> 01:08:10,119
written<font color="#CCCCCC"> down and that means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's no</font>

1375
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:13,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">longer in a cache it's actually in a DNS</font>

1376
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:14,769
zone with a serial number and when the

1377
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:16,330
service goes away you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice</font>

1378
01:08:14,769 --> 01:08:20,849
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's gone away and remove that</font>

1379
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:24,158
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the zone so another</font>

1380
01:08:20,849 --> 01:08:25,779
disadvantages approach you know if you

1381
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:27,608
want stable naming an infrastructure

1382
01:08:25,779 --> 01:08:29,020
that's great but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't this is</font>

1383
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:32,319
extra work so not everybody's going to

1384
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:35,139
want this um and in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the</font>

1385
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:37,029
mdns style trust model of trusting

1386
01:08:35,139 --> 01:08:41,889
whatever's on the link you need to have

1387
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:43,989
forwarders on each link<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuart talked</font>

1388
01:08:41,889 --> 01:08:46,389
about a secure pairing protocol that

1389
01:08:43,988 --> 01:08:49,089
that might work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> days</font>

1390
01:08:46,389 --> 01:08:50,920
ago at breakfast and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm curious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

1391
01:08:49,089 --> 01:08:52,448
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might solve the need for</font>

1392
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,710
forwarders on the local link of course

1393
01:08:52,448 --> 01:08:57,580
we'll still need forwarders on the local

1394
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:58,980
link to support legacy and dns the

1395
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:02,170
particular bad news of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

1396
01:08:58,979 --> 01:09:04,540
any printer that you buy that supports

1397
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:08,380
this also<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably has to support mdns</font>

1398
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:13,238
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a there's some disadvantages</font>

1399
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:15,819
obviously that's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> so why do it uh be</font>

1400
01:09:13,238 --> 01:09:18,330
nice to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to have real</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS to be</font>

1401
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:21,060
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to publish things in the DNS</font>

1402
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:24,269
that can be reached globally when when

1403
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:25,770
the information is useful globally

1404
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:27,839
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to publish things</font>

1405
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:29,430
globally if the information is not

1406
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:33,229
useful globally or if it would be a

1407
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:33,230
privacy problem to publish it globally

1408
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:38,760
it probably makes a lot of sense in some

1413
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,180
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go into huge detail about</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're if you're interested in</font>

1415
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:57,960
this work I did write a draft the draft

1416
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:59,849
is pretty sketchy right now but it

1417
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,050
covers this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a lot more detail but</font>

1418
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:03,420
just to cover it in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of</font>

1419
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:05,640
detail to serve the what how<font color="#E5E5E5"> this works</font>

1420
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:07,560
is that services need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go out and look</font>

1421
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:10,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see if they're on a stateful ml DNS</font>

1422
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:14,700
SD network if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they do</font>

1423
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:19,020
registration using<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS updates with 60</font>

1424
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:22,470
if they're not then they just do the NSS

1425
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:27,230
d um whenever link state changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> nose</font>

1426
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:27,230
noticed you have to go do this again so

1427
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:34,800
let's see uh<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have a device</font>

1428
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:37,290
providing service on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network that</font>

1429
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:40,910
only provides mdns it still has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

1430
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:43,230
discovered<font color="#E5E5E5"> using hybrid proxy and then</font>

1431
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:45,180
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> zones are populated using both</font>

1432
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:47,070
methods so if you have devices that are

1433
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:50,810
doing NS update and that's how they

1434
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:55,019
populate the zone otherwise the zone is

1435
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:57,150
populated using you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> by discovering</font>

1436
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:58,380
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> through mdns which means that the</font>

1437
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:59,790
zone probably won't contain every

1438
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:01,380
service on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network only the ones</font>

1439
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:03,060
that someone's tried to discover or for

1440
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:04,830
which we've seen announcements you only

1441
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:10,340
get announcements when the server when

1442
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:13,320
the service powers on next slide so um

1443
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:14,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">the as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said the specs pretty sketchy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1444
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,019
haven't tried doing an implementation

1445
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:19,769
yet if I had the spec would be a lot

1446
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:21,240
less sketchy and one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that</font>

1447
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:22,650
occurred to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as I was writing down how</font>

1448
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:26,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do the update process is that it's</font>

1449
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:28,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">really kind of a pain in the ass and it</font>

1450
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:30,780
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be better to just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do you know some</font>

1451
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:31,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of HTTPS transaction to do the</font>

1452
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:34,080
update rather than

1453
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:37,020
rather than doing like 5 dns updates

1454
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:41,340
with dependencies and 60 and all that

1455
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:43,650
stuff so that's that's the basic the

1456
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:45,120
basic pitch<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm curious to know what</font>

1457
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:47,280
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this if everybody</font>

1458
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:49,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinks this is a crazy idea or if</font>

1459
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:51,449
anybody thinks it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1460
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:52,500
thanks Ted so yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know what's</font>

1461
01:11:51,449 --> 01:11:54,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">true it's about to say but I think he's</font>

1462
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:56,190
made it clear earlier in terms of the

1463
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:59,730
vendors are doing and or not doing with

1464
01:11:56,190 --> 01:12:01,110
the NSF<font color="#E5E5E5"> tatum devices so got time to</font>

1465
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:02,549
little bit of discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stuart's at the</font>

1466
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:04,980
mic if anyone wants to come in on me

1467
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:07,350
check<font color="#CCCCCC"> out just press your indie</font>

1468
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:10,559
hand-raising button and you're free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1469
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:12,150
come in so Stuart fast I actually came

1470
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,219
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mic just to make a very quick</font>

1471
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:16,320
comment that I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you that the</font>

1472
01:12:14,219 --> 01:12:18,900
DNS update stuff does seem like a pain

1473
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:23,340
in the ass we used<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for back to my</font>

1474
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:26,160
Mac like<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nine years ago and yes it</font>

1475
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:28,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">is very complicated are trying to</font>

1476
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:31,139
combine all the updates into something

1477
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:33,300
that is efficient are and we actually

1478
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:34,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">never did that so it ends up just being</font>

1479
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:37,469
a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of separate updates which is not</font>

1480
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:39,660
efficient at the prerequisite so that

1481
01:12:37,469 --> 01:12:42,900
you fail if someone else already has

1482
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:46,290
that name are complicated and it is

1483
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:49,410
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that overall the 20 or 30 or</font>

1484
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:51,989
50 dynamic dns services that are

1485
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:54,630
available on the Internet I don't know a

1486
01:12:51,989 --> 01:12:57,239
single one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses DNS update yep they</font>

1487
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:59,280
all basically have a web UI that you

1488
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:01,169
fill in username password and IP address

1489
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:03,330
and then they have clients that

1490
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:05,550
effectively<font color="#CCCCCC"> reverse-engineered the web</font>

1491
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:08,519
UI and pretend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a client filling in</font>

1492
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:11,460
username password an IP address so that

1493
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:14,030
does seem to be a large precedent here

1494
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:17,550
for just doing it over<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS all right</font>

1495
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:20,309
that yeah that kind of makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense yeah</font>

1496
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:22,199
I actually came to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a conclusion after</font>

1497
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:24,030
writing the long complicated explanation

1498
01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:27,210
of how to do it and I thought why don't

1499
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:31,980
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do it easy way ok there any</font>

1500
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:34,770
other comments on looks oh I guess the

1501
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:36,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is where do we go next on their</font>

1502
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:37,739
side well I think it's some very good

1503
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:39,480
thoughts though it's a matter of yeah

1504
01:13:37,739 --> 01:13:41,820
Irene<font color="#E5E5E5"> crystallized them into something I</font>

1505
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:43,980
I wouldn't necessarily proposed that the

1506
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:45,299
working group work on this right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1507
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:45,790
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

1508
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,380
homework

1509
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:49,150
for the working it really takes a

1510
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:50,860
serious look at this I'm just curious if

1511
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:52,780
anybody is<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working on it I</font>

1512
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:54,429
think yeah it's great you've you've

1513
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:57,250
written it down for us to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1514
01:13:54,430 --> 01:14:01,030
front of us here that's great Kenny Shaw

1515
01:13:57,250 --> 01:14:04,300
honey<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I'm still confused as to what</font>

1516
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:06,250
the practical use cases would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1517
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:09,310
that would determine to some extent also

1518
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:11,830
as to what roulette mechanism is so in

1519
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:13,450
many cases kind of thing coyote since

1520
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:16,059
this seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of rethink to</font>

1521
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:17,710
think about these days is what you have

1522
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:21,670
devices in a home that need to

1523
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:24,220
communicate what somebody else you would

1524
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:25,690
probably not my putting it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

1525
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:27,820
somewhere is probably not going to help

1526
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:31,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">you because right which domain name</font>

1527
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:34,480
would I put it under usefully dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> hein</font>

1528
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:37,360
yeah yeah please don't request a new TLD

1529
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:39,160
ya know the use case that I that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

1530
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,839
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of for this is actually at this</font>

1531
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:42,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">point i would say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty restricted</font>

1532
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,660
use case and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why i don't really</font>

1533
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:45,519
think the working group should

1534
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:47,440
necessarily feel like going you know

1535
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,730
blazingly forward on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

1536
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:50,889
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> is simply that your device</font>

1537
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:52,000
discovers a device in the home that

1538
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:53,470
you'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach</font>

1539
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
outside of the home you'd like to have

1540
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:57,130
the same name outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the home that</font>

1541
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,800
has inside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them because global dns is</font>

1542
01:14:57,130 --> 01:15:01,480
great and so the only way you can really

1543
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,280
do that is if you is if you either

1544
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:05,709
actually has two ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it one is</font>

1545
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:07,780
you can just have the hybrid dns proxy

1546
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:09,640
reachable from the outside which i think

1547
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:10,920
is a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit dangerous because the</font>

1548
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:13,390
device that's answering those queries

isn't visit a high powered device and be

1550
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:18,820
really easy to do s it the other option

1551
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:21,580
is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to have a zone and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

service outside that is visible but this

1556
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:32,259
is something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think is a fairly</font>

1557
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:33,580
edge case<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean i want it on my home</font>

1558
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:35,140
net because i want the ability to

1559

publish services from my home net that i

1560

can reach what percent of end users want

1561

this probably right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> under</font>

that discoverability in the iot space is

1566
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:59,590
showed on and all of that is certainly a

contributor

1575
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,400
doesn't mean people wont do it

1576
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:23,679
particularly if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not obvious what</font>

will happen if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">about giving disability of vendo</font>

vendor implementation should be allowed

01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:33,489
to ask to say publish this in the dns

1582
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:35,679
the youth the end users should have to

say publish this in the dns and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end</font>

1585
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:41,040
know to do it and therefore won't do it

1586
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:43,960
and therefore we don't have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1587
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:46,179
just came back to answer Tim's question

1588
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:47,409
or implied question I thanks for doing

1589
01:16:46,179 --> 01:16:49,210
this worked at I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1590
01:16:47,409 --> 01:16:51,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting you're right it is kind of</font>

1591
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:54,699
preliminary at this stage but I think

1592
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:56,260
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good area to explore so and then</font>

1593
01:16:54,699 --> 01:16:59,559
it will talk about adopting work move

1594
01:16:56,260 --> 01:17:01,659
document at this stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'm I'd be</font>

1595
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:03,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">happy to work with you more on this we</font>

1596
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:04,570
can get together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> chat about our</font>

1597
01:17:03,219 --> 01:17:06,040
phone calls because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there's a</font>

1598
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:11,889
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting stuff to explore</font>

1599
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:20,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">here I'll be great thank you great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

1600
01:17:11,889 --> 01:17:26,520
thank you so something back then many

1601
01:17:20,409 --> 01:17:26,519
slides again see where we are so

1602
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:45,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay good so right okay so I think there</font>

1603
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:46,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">are a couple of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just to look at</font>

1604
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:48,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">before you wrap more three things one is</font>

1605
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:51,540
just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick review of where he might be</font>

1606
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:53,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">with other drafts second thing was</font>

1607
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:55,200
looking at our milestones and the third

1608
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:59,040
thing was just recapping the outcomes

1609
01:17:55,200 --> 01:18:00,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we've got from today so the first</font>

1610
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:03,600
one of the other drafts that are out

1611
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:07,320
there is as Tom and Ralph<font color="#E5E5E5"> were we're</font>

1612
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:09,450
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> together on the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BCPs</font>

1613
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:11,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">to it puts it for using this technology</font>

1614
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:13,019
in a large campus stroke enterprise

1615
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:16,110
environment I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's going to be a</font>

1616
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:18,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">very important thing tom has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> written a</font>

1617
01:18:16,110 --> 01:18:22,170
draft which is more about configuration

1618
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:23,610
rather than deployment and operation

1619
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:24,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe but if we can bring all those</font>

1620
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:27,150
things together in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a draft that'd be</font>

1621
01:18:24,930 --> 01:18:28,710
great so again if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we if there's one or</font>

1622
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:30,629
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> people out here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who would like to</font>

1623
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:32,670
help Tom and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ralph with that I think</font>

1624
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:34,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be timely I mean the other</font>

1625
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:36,330
thing from what Ted was saying there is

1626
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:38,400
maybe what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're hinting at there is a</font>

1627
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:41,880
similar type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing for a home network</font>

1628
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:43,559
how you actually make this work what's

1629
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:45,060
putting together what bits might be

1630
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:47,870
missing in from a practical point of

1631
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:51,690
view maybe that's what we're looking for

1632
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:53,880
there was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DA SSD fret document that</font>

1633
01:18:51,690 --> 01:19:00,360
hasn't been updated now for more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

1634
01:18:53,880 --> 01:19:02,070
six months there the author<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosny hasn't</font>

1635
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:04,320
really answered the open questions that

1636
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:05,460
were but they I think Andrew Sullivan

1637
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:07,500
are some very good questions those

1638
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:09,000
haven't been answered so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> as far</font>

1639
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:11,460
as Ralph and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> are concerned that's</font>

1640
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,130
parked pending those questions being

1641
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:16,100
answered there's the hybrid proxy

1642
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:19,500
zeroconf or maybe know that this

1643
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:22,140
discovery foxy<font color="#CCCCCC"> zeroconf over in the home</font>

1644
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:25,200
networking group so Ralph and I will

1645
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:26,430
have a check with Marcus to see where we

1646
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:29,490
are with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that obviously that was weight</font>

1647
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:32,040
of waiting publication based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

1648
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:36,269
hybrid proxy being published there was

1649
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:37,950
also going back further an interesting

1650
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:41,220
draft about how you might optimize

1651
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:43,929
queries the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SD so again Ralph and I</font>

1652
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:46,900
will take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1653
01:19:43,929 --> 01:19:49,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the milestones as with many working</font>

1654
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:53,888
groups they they can slip a little bit

1655
01:19:49,179 --> 01:19:59,439
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to time so what we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

1656
01:19:53,889 --> 01:20:02,199
in so the lq is no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> really called</font>

1657
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:05,079
llq that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on I think we</font>

1658
01:20:02,199 --> 01:20:08,049
have probably parked the threat model

1659
01:20:05,079 --> 01:20:14,170
document longer queries has become<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

1660
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:17,619
push new company Jocasta NS problems and

1661
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:19,539
challenges I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really the</font>

1662
01:20:17,619 --> 01:20:23,619
focus of that was the label<font color="#CCCCCC"> interop</font>

1663
01:20:19,539 --> 01:20:25,268
which which we got done the<font color="#CCCCCC"> white area</font>

1664
01:20:23,619 --> 01:20:27,339
service discovery solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> draftees</font>

1665
01:20:25,269 --> 01:20:30,969
Howard pops<font color="#E5E5E5"> your discovery proxy now so</font>

1666
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:33,489
we're very<font color="#CCCCCC"> close with that and the</font>

1667
01:20:30,969 --> 01:20:34,959
implementation draft I think was the

1668
01:20:33,489 --> 01:20:36,159
guidance on how to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so that</font>

1669
01:20:34,959 --> 01:20:38,260
stuff's kind of there<font color="#E5E5E5"> but i think the</font>

1670
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:41,530
things that we're picking<font color="#CCCCCC"> up potentially</font>

1671
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:43,539
is additional additional items now one

1672
01:20:41,530 --> 01:20:45,820
would be the advertisement proxy that

1673
01:20:43,539 --> 01:20:47,860
Stuart talked about the second would be

1674
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:50,679
the we<font color="#CCCCCC"> called it in the past the</font>

1675
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:52,268
stitching document which is about how

1676
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:55,449
you bring together multiple links for

1677
01:20:52,269 --> 01:21:03,030
example in the home network case and

1678
01:20:55,449 --> 01:21:06,669
deal with that then we've got ya the the

1679
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:09,688
<font color="#CCCCCC">bcp for campus stroke enterprise we've</font>

1680
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:12,309
got the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> home thing that Ted spoke to</font>

1681
01:21:09,689 --> 01:21:14,920
as well so there's there's certainly

1682
01:21:12,309 --> 01:21:17,769
future things that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could put into the</font>

1683
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:19,570
milestones then does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all seem</font>

1684
01:21:17,769 --> 01:21:22,150
reasonable things we've measurements a

1685
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:24,219
few nodding heads there so Ralph and I

1686
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:26,709
will have a chat<font color="#E5E5E5"> with Terry about that</font>

1687
01:21:24,219 --> 01:21:29,289
about updating the a nice thing now with

1688
01:21:26,709 --> 01:21:31,780
the tools team you do a fantastic job

1689
01:21:29,289 --> 01:21:34,030
this part of the edit edit button now

1690
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:35,679
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> working group you can just put</font>

1691
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:38,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a list of suggested milestones and</font>

1692
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:40,360
click submit for review I think so it's

1693
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:42,249
a nice interface for the chairs now to

1694
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:44,469
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and so we'll look at that I</font>

1695
01:21:42,249 --> 01:21:47,289
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think everything makes sense I</font>

1696
01:21:44,469 --> 01:21:49,030
don't think we're not hugely behind i

1697
01:21:47,289 --> 01:21:50,409
think there's good reasons for things

1698
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:52,659
having involved the way that they have

1699
01:21:50,409 --> 01:21:55,179
and also spitting out some of the work

1700
01:21:52,659 --> 01:21:57,518
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns or we've obviously also got to</font>

1701
01:21:55,179 --> 01:21:57,740
get some review by security area on some

1702
01:21:57,519 --> 01:22:02,420
of

1703
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:04,700
I think in general we're okay okay is

1704
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:07,490
there any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other business anyone wants to</font>

1705
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:08,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">raise any other comments we've got eight</font>

1706
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:11,780
minutes left I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a quick</font>

1707
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:17,179
recap as well of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the outcomes we're all</font>

1708
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:23,509
happy good nobody no ghosts appearing on

1709
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:25,100
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a good as well so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1710
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:26,660
was going oh oh what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was going to say</font>

1711
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:29,150
about the session signaling document is

1712
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:30,470
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll do some updates but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping</font>

1713
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:32,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get like a working group last call</font>

1714
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:34,910
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dina stop by early part of next</font>

1715
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:36,830
year like by January sort of thing so

1716
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:39,019
figure to use the next month and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a half</font>

1717
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:41,120
to sort of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the edits and get</font>

1718
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:42,560
that moving sort of thing so yeah

1719
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:44,450
hopefully won't stick some of the stuff

1720
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:48,290
push that by mid-december it'll

1721
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:51,500
disappear to exact into<font color="#E5E5E5"> January great so</font>

1722
01:22:48,290 --> 01:22:54,080
yeah that's certainly one one outcome we

1723
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:57,470
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> also the unanimous view of the room</font>

1724
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:59,690
to change hybrid proxy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to discovery</font>

1725
01:22:57,470 --> 01:23:02,840
proxy book or to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by the list as</font>

1726
01:22:59,690 --> 01:23:04,910

publication of 06 that will have a new

1728
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:11,330

<font color="#CCCCCC">that we will at some point see an</font>

advertising proxy document<font color="#CCCCCC"> emerge third</font>

1731
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:20,990
thing DNS push we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move</font>

1732
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:24,620
towards completing that and probably a

1733
01:23:20,990 --> 01:23:28,550
working group last call on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that soon as</font>

1734
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:30,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">well and the signaling draft you've just</font>

1735
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:32,600
heard about<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got a couple of open</font>

1736
01:23:30,290 --> 01:23:35,150
questions to resolve them and move on

1737
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:36,440
with that privacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> in pairing it looks</font>

1738
01:23:35,150 --> 01:23:38,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">like we're going to be in a good</font>

1739
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:44,230
position with some implementations from

1740
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:46,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">Daniel to review those come IHF 98</font>

1741
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:50,750
there's some decisions to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be made there</font>

1742
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:53,180
as to whether the communications are

1743
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:56,420
using TLS are going to be done as a TLS

1744
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:58,930
extension or<font color="#E5E5E5"> as application specific</font>

1745
01:23:56,420 --> 01:24:01,040
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs some review by the TLS</font>

1746
01:23:58,930 --> 01:24:04,310
experts the whole thing needs to move

1747
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:06,170
you by security area on Ted's work I

1748
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:08,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we've all agreed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's very</font>

1749
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:10,400
useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're very pleased that Ted's</font>

1750
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:11,510
documented it and we will have ongoing

1751
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:15,500
discussions about

1752
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:17,750
how we move that forward on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp for</font>

1753
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:20,269
campus and enterprise if we can get one

1754
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:22,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two more authors for that to help</font>

1755
01:24:20,269 --> 01:24:24,289
push that forward that would be great as

1756
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:27,920
well since that sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of bcp documents</font>

1757
01:24:24,289 --> 01:24:32,110
going to be very useful otherwise I

1758
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:35,119
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's if it's any other comments</font>
