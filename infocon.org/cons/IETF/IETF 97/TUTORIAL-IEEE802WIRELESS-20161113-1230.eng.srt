1
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,450
well it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to begin I'll just</font>

2
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:11,409
say a couple things before really

3
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:14,170
getting started first of all lesser I

4
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:16,150
probably will become obvious I'm not the

5
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,119
originator of the material<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the slides</font>

6
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:22,030
and so there's three presentations and I

7
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:25,060
just sent them to take Karen and she'll

8
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:29,740
post them on an ITF website presumably

9
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:31,780
any minute now and but these

10
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,640
presentations are the two large

11
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,159
presentations are actually taken from

12
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,490
stuff that's already publicly available

13
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:43,659
from my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tripoli website so that's one</font>

14
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:48,610
thing um see oh I guess it's time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

15
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:50,350
started well before I forget if I say

16
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,840
something that doesn't make sense or if

17
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:56,890
you want more information about anything

18
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular we only have an hour but I'll</font>

19
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:02,350
do my best to make a short answer now

20
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:05,380
and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see my email address up</font>

21
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:07,960
there and on average i'll respond so

22
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,600
please I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't hesitate to send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email</font>

23
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,400
and if I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer i will</font>

24
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:16,850
i'll find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for you so welcome to the</font>

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,030
wireless tutorial

26
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:22,760
802 wireless this is a nub date from

27
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,380
februari presentation and I have been

28
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">assured there would be a good idea for</font>

29
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:31,299
me to read this<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you I didn't write</font>

30
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:34,130
this at lecture symposia seminars or

31
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,440
educational courses an individual for

32
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,420
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> me presenting information on</font>

33
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,890
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tripoli standard shall make it clear</font>

34
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,690
that his or her views should be

35
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,970
considered the personal views of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

36
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,070
individual rather than the formal

37
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,490
position explanation or interpretation

38
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:56,230
of that Tripoli and so that's way more

39
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:56,230
formal than I usually a.m. so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted</font>

40
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,620
well there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of rigmarole about</font>

41
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:13,369
that typically I if I trip Lee wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

42
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:15,650
make a formal position navel to another

43
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,320
body for instance idea they'll establish

44
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:21,700
a liaison and then the liaison

45
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:25,190
statements will be vetted by various

46
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:28,850
standing committees on over couple in an

48
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:33,320
an honest effort to make the<font color="#E5E5E5"> statements</font>

49
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,239
say what I Tripoli said that on you know

00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that should say and then it's</font>

community I know this 802 wireless to

00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:50,480
wealthy that back there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a study group</font>

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,299
technical advisory group that makes

55
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,429
white papers but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're just to be</font>

56
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,700
construed<font color="#CCCCCC"> as an informational and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

57
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,800
effort of people that are involved not a

not a statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> of on Tripoli standards</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Association but on the other hand</font>

60
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:09,170
they're usually pretty good anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

61
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:14,299
I just don't but if they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong you</font>

62
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:17,029
can't sue I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tripoli okay so i'm here to</font>

63
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,910
present<font color="#E5E5E5"> the material i understand most</font>

of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've been involved with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

stuff with them on Tripoli 802 wireless

66
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,919
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately within the next forty</font>

67
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,710
or fifty eight minutes or so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't</font>

68
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">really give you technical descriptions</font>

69
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:36,969
and there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of places where it</font>

70
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:39,950
I can show some<font color="#CCCCCC"> meticulous but overall</font>

71
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:42,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll try to explain to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you why stuff is</font>

72
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:45,229
interesting and where it fits and I

73
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,090
Triple E and then again if I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

74
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:51,320
an answer to your question I can find

75
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:54,619
out I started going to 80 two but six

76
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,840
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago was involved with 80 to 21</font>

77
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:01,640
which is a more or less an interface

78
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,929
group between III TF and an 802 lately

79
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,880
I've been involved with Internet of

80
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:12,380
Things technical materials in this

81
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:14,300
largely in 802 dot 15 also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

82
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,850
involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only ran in a standing</font>

83
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,800
committee for IETF on Moran is I

84
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:22,970
believed when I have a presentation here

85
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:26,300
in int area sometime this week I think I

86
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:29,510
don't remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe JC Zuniga's going</font>

87
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:32,090
to do that anyway all these documents

88
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:36,620
and it's all freely available you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

89
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:39,679
see the URL there on mentor whenever I

90
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:42,790
type Emmy on my computer I go to MIT org

91
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:47,840
and it's all there it's usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

92
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:51,590
interesting stuff the 802 dot11 material

93
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,270
is here from she Dorothy Stanley created

94
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,820
as she unfortunately couldn't be here

95
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:59,900
today because<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting from San Antonio</font>

96
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:02,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">on Friday to Seoul South Korea on sunday</font>

97
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:06,140
is beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> the airline's capability it</font>

98
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,940
seems so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I cut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out all the sessions on</font>

99
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,640
Friday and flew over here to be here

100
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:13,820
today and she'll be here<font color="#CCCCCC"> tomorrow in</font>

101
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:17,719
some frame of mind and she's also going

102
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:19,909
to be available<font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions Bob</font>

103
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,150
highly I believe will also be here in

104
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:25,970
Seoul he's the chair of a talk about 15

105
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,820
so practically all of this material<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

106
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,920
going to be updates<font color="#E5E5E5"> just from a tour</font>

107
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:34,310
2011 and a tour<font color="#CCCCCC"> to dot 15 there's other</font>

108
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:36,260
interesting groups in 802 so here's an

109
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,530
overall diagram<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight oh two dot one is</font>

110
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:42,530
a very interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> area um well as it's</font>

111
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,289
sort of the switch protocols and so on

112
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,619
and

113
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:49,740
wireless LAN is a tour 2011<font color="#E5E5E5"> it had 15</font>

114
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:51,509
over here is why they call it<font color="#CCCCCC"> wireless</font>

115
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,059
specialty networks now used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

116
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:57,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">personal area networks and then you can</font>

117
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:59,009
see there's several others dot 16 used

118
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:01,550
to be all wimax lately they've been

119
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:03,629
doing some other interesting things

120
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:07,979
coexistence has to do with things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

121
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:11,009
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> does dot 15 interact with 11 how do</font>

122
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:14,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">we interact with the 3gpp and so on and</font>

123
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:16,889
in there's just 24 is a good place to

124
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:22,259
get white papers for instance they have

125
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:23,879
some IOT stuff and um actually I can't

126
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:35,580
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> lately what they've been doing</font>

127
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:43,110
and nothing oh how did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happen come</font>

128
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:47,058
back come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back okay okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

129
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:50,639
those wired connections are so finicky

130
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:54,180
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cadott</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 has 350 non-voting</font>

131
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,709
members plus 12x a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> CEO and + 115</font>

132
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,319
that are going to be probably voting

133
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:02,749
soon and first part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our presentation</font>

134
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:05,309
is going to be all<font color="#CCCCCC"> about dot11 stuff and</font>

before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get there i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted to</font>

144
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:42,000
new work items as needed but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the task</font>

145
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:43,949
group is really working towards them

146
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,529
according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a schedule with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

147
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:47,969
well-defined deliverable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

148
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,819
there's study groups which can be

149
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,350
considered<font color="#CCCCCC"> a precursor to a task group</font>

150
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:54,810
and the task groups I've been involved

151
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,490
with it we're preceded by study groups

152
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,529
and before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a study</font>

153
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:01,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">group you can have a either topic</font>

154
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:05,959
interest group n dot 11 or in dot 15 is

155
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:08,459
just called an interest group and IG so

156
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:13,229
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try I have a little cheat</font>

157
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:15,750
sheet here so what's happening is that

158
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,730
Dorothy gave me a really a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of slides</font>

159
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,709
and there's no way I could cover them

160
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,390
all so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to not cover them all</font>

161
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:23,069
and I just put these in the presentation

162
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:28,290
so you'd know which ones i was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

163
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:33,720
cover if you download it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from from the</font>

164
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:35,370
ITF website<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so this is a by the way</font>

165
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,180
up here you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

166
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:42,420
canonical form this is a a tour 2011

167
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:45,390
document and it shows that is 2016 and

168
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:55,410
this is document number 500 release one

169
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:58,140
so in fact it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second year that's</font>

170
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:01,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much what i showed right here dot</font>

171
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:04,199
integra dot 1116 document 500 release

172
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:05,760
one so if you want I can show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a min</font>

173
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">or how to get that stuff let me just</font>

174
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:12,839
take a few seconds to do that mentored

175
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:16,349
so here if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to mini ah Tripoli org</font>

176
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:20,190
you can go to 11 or dot 15 and if you go

177
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:24,480
to 15 let's just say for example at some

178
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:26,790
point you will see here voila that Bob

179
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,850
highly finished a document on number 8

180
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:32,329
43 revision 1 and this what you're going

181
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:36,270
to see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit later today so</font>

182
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:39,500
so that's enough of mentor for now and

183
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:42,449
we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to Dorothy's presentation so</font>

184
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:45,329
this she's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a description of what</font>

185
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:48,829
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be telling you about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font>

186
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:51,719
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually an update from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

187
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:55,290
presentation it was made earlier in

188
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,240
February and that was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very big update</font>

189
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:59,399
from a previous presentation made by

190
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,160
Donald<font color="#CCCCCC"> eastlake and so all of those</font>

191
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,920
slides are sort of batched together in

192
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,110
Dorothy's presentation oh you went to

193

hesitate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I stove because I'm</font>

195
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:16,709
I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it all out here</font>

196
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:18,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um so these things are still</font>

auld up there and you can download this

198
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:23,130
presentation in its entirety but I'm

199
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:25,199
only going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through part of it so</font>

200
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:27,680
they'll update part of this it has to do

201
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,430
with them<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's happening since some</font>

202
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:36,359
since februari and we have this sub

203
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:38,969
gigahertz slide is basically done that's

204
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,490
I can't give you very much in material

205
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,930
about that the fast initial

206
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,550
authentication is I think of some

207
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:48,089
interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll say a few more things</font>

208
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,650
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and the revision project I'm</font>

209
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,450
not going to say anything really about

210
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,640
but I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you how</font>

211
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:59,040
important it is because what happens is

212
00:11:53,640 --> 00:12:01,500
aah yeah let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me go to this slide just</font>

213
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:06,860
for a minute so what happens in dot 11

214
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:09,420
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start with this Wireless and</font>

215
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,830
not guess the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next generation but anyway</font>

216
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,260
this is where people<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in with</font>

217
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:16,290
proposals on technical work that has to

218
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:18,450
be done and so then some some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

219
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually constituted in the study groups</font>

220
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:23,220
and interest groups and then some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

221
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:26,070
that progresses into actual task groups

222
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,350
with deliverables and then the task

223
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,900
groups work away for a while until they

224
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:35,640
can come over the specification and then

225
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:38,280
the working group votes on it or comes

226
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,710
up with comments and when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> say come up</font>

227
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,810
with comments I'm not kidding some of

228
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:45,270
them have like a thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> 500 comments</font>

229
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:48,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">and every last one of those comments has</font>

230
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:52,319
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolved and they're usually</font>

231
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,630
perceptive in some way so and then once

232
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,360
you get through with the working group

233
00:12:54,630 --> 00:13:00,000
which remember is like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Triple E area</font>

234
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,070
director then it actually goes into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

235
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,740
standards<font color="#E5E5E5"> Association which is our</font>

236
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:07,050
sponsor and that broads it makes it

237
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:10,380
brought much broader community for input

238
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:13,140
not just 80 to wireless but the entire

239
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,610
standards organization and then they

240
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:18,360
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> get published well what I was</font>

241
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:22,410
going to say about the revision project

242
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,230
is these amendments it boils down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

243
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,290
you have a tude

244
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:28,480
11 which happened a long time ago and

245
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,849
even before then as you know it's been

246
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">around for almost 20 years and then</font>

247
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:37,390
amendments get made that makes serious

248
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:40,150
changes to the evolution of the standard

249
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:43,330
and people can't find all that stuff

250
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:45,310
very easily so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> roll up or the</font>

251
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,350
revision actually puts all the

252
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:50,979
amendments into a single document and

253
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:53,290
this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Don 11 just is some it's</font>

254
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:56,880
published so it includes these ones here

255
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:59,469
for instance TV<font color="#CCCCCC"> wyd space and so on ac</font>

256
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,570
gives you I guess I think that they

257
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:06,550
provide data rates up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 gigahertz</font>

258
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:09,040
actually or bits per second and so it's

259
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:13,449
it's some interesting stuff well anyway

260
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,670
back to where I was in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

261
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:18,310
I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these and then new</font>

262
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:21,300
activities is this wake up radio<font color="#CCCCCC"> Task</font>

263
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:24,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">Group</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which i think is super important</font>

264
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it grew out of this a long</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> range low</font>

265
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:29,590
power not to remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention the</font>

266
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,840
toes interest groups and done<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

267
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:34,900
was a successful effort and they have

268
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,750
now on a project to make an amendment

269
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:40,840
for that there's also a topic interest

270
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,640
group on live communications so

271
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,450
something about life I<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear which I</font>

272
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:49,060
personally think is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> terrific new area</font>

273
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:51,220
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> um well we're going to that's going</font>

274
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,380
to make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge impact and then there's a</font>

275
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:58,000
lot of interest in discussions about

276
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:59,770
them interaction between 11 and 3 gpp

277
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,880
and I'll have more to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

278
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:08,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">later</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I'll women make sure</font>

279
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:10,990
yeah so this wake up radio again I've

280
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,660
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> got another maybe at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most 20</font>

281
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:16,810
minutes to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot11</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I can't</font>

282
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:19,230
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into very much detail at all but one</font>

283
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,699
way you can really save a lot of battery

284
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:24,100
consumption is this i turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> the device</font>

285
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,890
off and then naturally if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do that</font>

286
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:29,650
you have to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way to wake it up so</font>

287
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:32,380
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see how Dorothy has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> organized</font>

288
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:35,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">its information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to show the use cases in</font>

289
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,420
the parameters for the technology and

290
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:39,160
here since you have now if you go in and

291
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,490
get this document which will be on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

292
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,949
ITF web page or from mentor you will be

293
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,769
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow these links to get all</font>

294
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:50,800
the interesting technical stuff by the

295
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:53,649
way i should<font color="#E5E5E5"> say one little thing about</font>

296
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,620
standards organization and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Triple E</font>

297
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:59,050
they require two documents one is

298
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:02,199
project authorization and it's called a

299
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:03,819
par and so you had to basically they're

300
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:04,930
not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> approve your project unless</font>

301
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,089
you can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them what you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

302
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:09,910
do so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the recipe for the</font>

303
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:11,740
deliverables for this wake up radio and

304
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:14,620
then not only you're going to have to

305
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,850
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them what you're doing and what</font>

306
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,350
you're going to live or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to tell</font>

307
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">them why in the heck you're doing it and</font>

308
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:24,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">so basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this boils down to what is</font>

309
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:26,620
the commercial advantage of this

310
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,740
technology how will it affect the

311
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:33,130
evolution of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot11 and you know the</font>

312
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:35,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">market and so on so that's all important</font>

313
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:39,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff for completing and getting a</font>

314
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:42,910
project approved here is a list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

315
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,500
currently interesting stuff and 11 other

316
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,779
works projects that really haven't been

317
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,630
completed some of these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

initial link set up a I as completed and

320
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:59,019
the revision is completed so this list

321
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,070
could be considered<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be shorter but I</font>

00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:02,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each one of</font>

these in specifics<font color="#E5E5E5"> I already showed you</font>

324
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,500
this picture but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to now at least</font>

325
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:10,448
emphasize that some of these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

326
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,970
more important or more interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

327
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:16,089
ITF folks than others so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance</font>

328
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:20,290
this high efficiency wireless ATT dot11

329
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:22,990
ax this is you might say will become

330
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:25,079
essentially next generation from AC an

331
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:30,100
AC is the one that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

332
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:33,010
multi-gigabit data rates and so a 8 11

333
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,750
ax is just a huge huge effort there's

334
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,990
hundreds of people in<font color="#CCCCCC"> every single</font>

335
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:40,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting and that translates into dozens</font>

336
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,730
and dozens of technical proposals and

337
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:46,690
arguments and I don't go because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> MnDOT</font>

338
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:49,899
15 but I stop by every once in a while

00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:53,019
and this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> over here this fast initial</font>

340
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:54,639
link setup you can see 11 AI is already

341
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:57,190
in sponsor ballot which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

342
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:59,080
working group has done done what is

343
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:04,149
basically wanting to do and now it's

344
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:07,750
just responding<font color="#CCCCCC"> to comments</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay other</font>

346
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:13,240
have some known areas of mutual interest

347
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:16,840
between I Triple E and I tf1 is at this

348
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:21,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">um internet-draft trying to describe use</font>

349
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:24,279
cases for and problems with multicast so

350
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:27,309
multicast is crucial for deployment of

351
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:30,809
ipv6 and yet multicast has numerous

352
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:33,789
issues with 80 2011 specifically and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

353
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:37,418
even worse issues related to about 15 in

354
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:41,470
a way so fell in the one hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

355
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:43,120
fabulous technology ipv6 on the other

00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">hand everybody wants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to run it over</font>

357
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,158
wireless and the multicast stuff has got

358
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:51,730
essentially got<font color="#E5E5E5"> bugs so that's what the</font>

359
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:53,649
point of this on document is and this

360
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">had been sort of on hold for the last</font>

361
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:58,779
four or five months because well<font color="#CCCCCC"> we ran</font>

362
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,000
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to do anything on it but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

363
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:03,419
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to be picked up</font>

364
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,529
again as soon as I we can get to it

365
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:08,889
there's a couple of things I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

366
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:10,929
much about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Harkins has some privacy</font>

367
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:14,408
tools opportunistic wireless encryption

368
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:16,230
and assaulted password thing so I think

369
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:18,730
those are probably pretty

370
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:22,029
straightforward things to read<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and</font>

371
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,980
then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also some ongoing work with</font>

372
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:26,679
cap way up cap is cat way up still

373
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:29,529
active I don't I don't think half pipe

374
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:33,159
is meeting but anyway people<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it for</font>

375
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:36,399
dot11 stuff so that's the end of what

376
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:38,259
Dorothy said was updated since februari

377
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:39,758
but I had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of other things I</font>

378
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:41,919
wanted to emphasize from the other

379
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:44,500
slides and I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go directly</font>

380
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">to them again and this will be on the</font>

381
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:50,529
ITF website and it's already I'll mentor

382
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:52,750
you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it I'm not just show this</font>

383
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:56,320
picture anyway so we had this body area

384
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:58,900
network and then around<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is pan this</font>

385
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,530
is a talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 stuff and other</font>

386
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:04,840
a case I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't mention it but later doc</font>

387
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:08,020
15 is shipping a million devices a day

388
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:12,189
so it's a pretty good choice for IOT

389
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:14,410
stuff then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a 2011 dot 16 which</font>

390
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,750
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have wimax tenant was considered</font>

391
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:19,450
a metropolitan area network and then we

392
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:24,160
have TV<font color="#E5E5E5"> wyd space stuff out and regional</font>

393
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:27,700
area networks is so called and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wish I</font>

394
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:35,130
had a glass of water I'll get one

395
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:38,020
shortly so here's a picture of how

396
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:42,730
dominant though Wi-Fi stuff is over

397
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:44,320
cellular radio thank you Tim I thought

398
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:48,250
if I drop the head somebody would help

399
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,730
me that's appreciated<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well if I</font>

400
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,990
drink all this it'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a miracle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

401
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,750
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway you can see from these</font>

402
00:20:52,990 --> 00:21:01,170
pictures that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wi-Fi is really caring</font>

403
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:04,420
most of the world's wireless data and

404
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:06,640
unfortunately I I think maybe one of

405
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:09,100
these is 2014 and other ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

406
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,860
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and it's also from the UK so</font>

407
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,959
you can't absolutely guarantee that the

408
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,969
same happens here but I'd be willing to

409
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,000
bet that in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. it's even more</font>

410
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:21,360
pronounced so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that means that Wi-Fi</font>

411
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
is really really really important

412
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,649
there's a Wi-Fi Alliance which I can't

413
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,590
tell you very much about but there's a

414
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:31,960
pretty I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a great amount of</font>

415
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:34,750
corporation between 80 to wireless and

416
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,850
the Wi-Fi Alliance and on Tripoli

417
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,640
doesn't do any certification or anything

418
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:41,560
like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in fact I think Wi-Fi</font>

419
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,080
Alliance you might consider to do more

420
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:48,159
of the system's level stuff instead of I

421
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:53,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">Triple E ok so i want to go to slide</font>

423

here but anybody have questions so far

424
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,910
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> specifics</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't hesitate to</font>

00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,510
the screen is not working

427
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:19,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to find your slides okay</font>

428
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:21,639
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't pick on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF</font>

429
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:23,498
website so that just means I didn't

430
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:26,199
finish them until about an hour ago and

431
00:22:23,499 --> 00:22:27,700
so I but I sent into karen and so she'll

432
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,649
get him up on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> website as soon as</font>

433
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,600
possible but<font color="#E5E5E5"> these ones are already</font>

434
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:36,370
available mentor if you can want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

435
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:39,309
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm okay but let tell you</font>

436
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:46,209
what let me take a another few seconds

437
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:48,789
break here and I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that so if you</font>

438
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:56,019
go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> minoru at Ripley org you'll see</font>

439
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:59,470
this and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go down here 2802 then</font>

440
00:22:56,019 --> 00:23:02,820
you can go to either dot11 or dot 15 and

441
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:06,730
so for instance here if I go to dot 11

442
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:13,149
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dorothy's presentation is</font>

443
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:19,840
500 so let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go 500 by golly there</font>

444
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:23,469
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah all right so this is</font>

445
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,999
just um this is more technical than I

446
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:27,669
probably would<font color="#E5E5E5"> get anywhere</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> else in this</font>

447
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:34,720
presentation but the idea was that when

448
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:36,330
your view and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it oh and you</font>

449
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,360
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is so many moving parts here</font>

450
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:42,759
from current slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so it's a Leyden</font>

451
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,158
11 I I that this is the fast initial

452
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:47,200
link setup thing they were faced with

453
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:52,029
this problem you go over<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and if</font>

454
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:56,049
you're using an authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> from what</font>

455
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:59,559
then existing 82 dot11 you had all these

456
00:23:56,049 --> 00:24:01,480
protocol steps well you know how long

457
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:04,119
that takes I mean it's aggravating right

458
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,220
and so it's good enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to long enough</font>

459
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:09,070
time to drop lots of packets and so on

460
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:11,470
so they spend a little while figuring

461
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:13,928
out how to make it better and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

462
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:16,149
don't know if this is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beat</font>

463
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:18,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can probe response is probably two</font>

464
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:19,939
messages at least and here we hopefully

465
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:22,639
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

466
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:26,419
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> two authentication messages</font>

467
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:29,299
but anyway diagrammatically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks a</font>

468
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:34,570
lot better and they've also allowed for

469
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:45,259
public key and shared key variations

470
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:49,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay now so here's a X this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

471
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:52,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">the you might say the next generation of</font>

472
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:55,658
attitude 11ac although it's not exactly

473
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:59,059
a linear thing but the point is that

474
00:24:55,659 --> 00:25:02,720
everybody expects that ax will be on the

475
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:09,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">future specification that allows</font>

476
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:12,649
extremely high data rate applications so

477
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:15,110
so focus on dis deployments now this is

478
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:17,570
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very important point because</font>

479
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:20,149
for one thing if you have a lot of

480
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:22,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">people in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an apartment complex that's a</font>

481
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:25,639
disappointment<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the thing if you have</font>

482
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:29,149
a lot of enterprises on a crowded Street

483
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:31,250
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of deployments and so what</font>

484
00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:33,199
it boils down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you have to do</font>

485
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:38,000
something to try to avoid interference

486
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:40,519
between all these sub access networks

487
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,649
that are separately managed and for

488
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:44,600
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> one thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there I believe</font>

489
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:46,070
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do I don't know if the</font>

490
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:50,928
current status<font color="#E5E5E5"> is but they were going to</font>

491
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:53,330
deprecate 82 dot 11 a-11 be just for the

492
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:57,169
simple reason that B takes up too much

493
00:25:53,330 --> 00:26:02,990
time on the air and it crowds out new

494
00:25:57,169 --> 00:26:04,879
standards like 11 ax so anyway as with

495
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:08,389
all new technologies has got to be

496
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:10,250
faster and low delay and more efficient

497
00:26:08,389 --> 00:26:12,258
and better power consumption and

498
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,470
everything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can think of but I</font>

499
00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:18,259
think they're making an honest effort

500
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:22,519
now i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a five-person physical layer</font>

501
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:24,529
person but when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i see 1024 QAM i think</font>

502
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:30,049
that's pretty hot that means they can

503
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:32,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a lot of bits per</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hertz of bandwidth</font>

504
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:32,760
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how many bits you</font>

505
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,380
get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

506
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,250
there's a quadrature amplitude

507
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:40,650
modulation and besides that they have

508
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:43,940
multi-user MIMO and other things so that

509
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:46,980
means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have pretty high</font>

510
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,810
efficiency and accuracy and extracting

511
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:52,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">your bits and you can get a lot of bits</font>

512
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:56,070
per Hertz so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really gonna notice</font>

513
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:59,580
it's going to be fabulous so so this is

514
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:01,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">0 they talked about also if you are able</font>

515
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:04,409
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do some sort of management between</font>

516
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:07,170
your base stations then you can do have

517
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:09,410
special reuse so you can see here if I

518
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:12,120
you have let's say seven different

519
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:15,570
frequency bands in your and that you're

520
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,840
allowed to allocate then you can have a

521
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:20,790
pretty high spatial reuse in this way

522
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:25,830
and I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to emphasize this slide</font>

523
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:27,450
just for a moment so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X</font>

524
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,580
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be honest this is slightly</font>

525
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,680
beyond my understanding I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

526
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:34,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">you exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how these things were the</font>

527
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,030
frequency bands were but I can I know

528
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:39,030
what this means you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> orthogonal</font>

529
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:41,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">frequency-division multiplexing and what</font>

530
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:45,750
it boils down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you have I</font>

531
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:48,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">think these are no time slots in and you</font>

532
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:52,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">can get these frequencies and so on but</font>

533
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:54,510
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have bid / per slot it all belongs</font>

534
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:58,800
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> one user but now you can actually</font>

535
00:27:54,510 --> 00:28:02,340
slice it up and have them in this way

536
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:04,320
they are able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do two more users into</font>

537
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:11,540
the same amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a spectrum in time</font>

538
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:15,659
slot<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's an example of ax and</font>

539
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:19,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing 37 yeah I 12 at least mention the</font>

540
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:22,860
802 dot11 a why because here they're

541
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:26,639
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 gigabits per second at</font>

542
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:32,969
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> access point it is high high</font>

543
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:35,190
spectral bands but well I think 20 yoga

544
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:36,930
bits per second is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool and so I</font>

545
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:38,900
think we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look forward to</font>

546
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:41,299
their showing a pictures here you know

547
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:47,600
buses and so on and

548
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:51,320
and well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so there's that for you</font>

549
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:54,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an interesting picture it</font>

550
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:57,980
shows it the same mac layer in 80 2011

551
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:59,929
is able to serve<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and B and G</font>

552
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,570
and in and you know we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

553
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:08,570
these ones here for a long time AC is

554
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:11,019
coming in and ax is in process so all

555
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:14,928
these things effectively can be used

556
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:17,779
without too much problem from the IP but

557
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:20,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">it uses the same device driver in many</font>

558
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:23,450
respects so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a good situation you</font>

559
00:29:20,749 --> 00:29:24,739
can pick out which physical layer option

560
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:28,039
you want and not have to change your

561
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:30,200
your network layer software and I want

562
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:34,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to this idea a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

563
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:36,649
later tion yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now for</font>

564
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:38,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">something completely different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font>

565
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:41,449
wanted to mention something about not

566
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:43,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">nineteen because when you have the</font>

567
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:45,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">situation where unlicensed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> band is</font>

568
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:50,029
carrying<font color="#CCCCCC"> the heavy majority of the</font>

569
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:52,939
world's data and 3gpp is collecting the

570
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:54,799
majority of the world's wireless revenue

571
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:58,129
then something<font color="#CCCCCC"> is eventually going to</font>

572
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:01,489
happen there and what's happening is or

573
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:03,259
something called laa but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I forgot</font>

574
00:30:01,489 --> 00:30:06,139
exactly what it stands for but it stands

575
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:09,080
for it what it means is that LTE and 83

576
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:13,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">at eleven are both planning to use</font>

577
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:15,739
unlicensed<font color="#E5E5E5"> ban or license exempt</font>

578
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:19,220
spectrum and they could crowd each other

579
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:22,879
out so there needs to be a way for LTE

580
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:26,809
folks and Tripoli folks to co-exist and

581
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:32,570
let the user use whichever one is best

582
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:35,690
for their needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> license assisted access</font>

583
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:37,850
I see well I that just makes my

584
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:41,989
imagination go wild so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

585
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:43,988
leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it at that so but I strongly</font>

586
00:30:41,989 --> 00:30:47,659
encourage you if you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

587
00:30:43,989 --> 00:30:50,179
coexistence of LTE or three TPP stuff

588
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:53,090
with i triple e to take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this</font>

589
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:55,010
and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they are a good this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

590
00:30:53,090 --> 00:31:01,330
topic of intense too

591
00:30:55,010 --> 00:31:01,330
discussion at every meeting lately yes I

592
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:17,450
don't know the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> there but let me</font>

593
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:20,000
copy it down that was the Wi-Fi<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alliance</font>

594
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:23,900
was concerned that LTE we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

595
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">start trashing the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys I spectrum say</font>

596
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:34,520
they were pushing some interoperability

597
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:36,439
mechanism should reduce the damage<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

598
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:39,580
just say that their discussions are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

599
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:42,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">release I'd have been intense and</font>

600
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:44,149
everybody everybody's like everybody

601
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,060
sees this train coming and nobody wants

602
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:51,670
to be a wreck so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to require</font>

603
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:51,669
some actual honest effort on both sides

604
00:31:52,840 --> 00:32:02,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so you mentioned briefly before</font>

605
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:05,990
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic of multicast and we have</font>

606
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:09,110
some performance optimization things and

607
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,910
we have this draft also with them well

608
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,560
there's a draft with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike McBride from</font>

609
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:15,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">pim and there's a draft</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've been</font>

610
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:20,659
involved with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on Dorothy and JC</font>

611
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:23,000
and Dan Harkins so on but this is

612
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:25,930
important because and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're happenin I</font>

613
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,720
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> t aside a lot of improvements for</font>

614
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:31,670
avoiding multicast problems with ipv6 so

615
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,740
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is an evolving area and it</font>

616
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:36,230
needs more attention and hopefully we'll

617
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:39,440
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a document that captures</font>

618
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:45,980
the important points and that actually

619
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:48,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">just what I just was talking about ok so</font>

620
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:51,170
additional topics of mutual interest on

621
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:54,410
just briefly honors wide space there's

622
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:58,040
ahora<font color="#CCCCCC"> si on providing access to the wide</font>

623
00:32:54,410 --> 00:33:01,100
space databases and I Tripoli at 80<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

624
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:03,830
dot 22 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot to do with the white</font>

625
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:07,340
space stuff mentioned before there's the

626
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:08,658
ongoing work with cap web and in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

recent actually but i think the D H

631
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:24,259
stands for dispatch header 46 low at

632
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:26,619
least I'm aware that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's happening</font>

going to talk about from dot 11 aside

645
00:33:59,649 --> 00:34:05,018
any questions before I move to a dot 15

646
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:09,529
well you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to ask now you can</font>

649
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:31,789
step from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob highly he's the chair of</font>

650
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:36,558
82 dot 15 and has some other

651
00:34:31,789 --> 00:34:39,079
affiliations as well and I have his

652
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:41,359
email address up later but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can send</font>

653
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:45,679
any question stage or Bob or maybe about

654
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:48,109
this and I've already made this

655
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,690
disclaimer so i will just remake the

656
00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:54,889
disclaimer okay so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

657
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:57,559
picture just shows a 2 2 dot 15 in its

658
00:34:54,889 --> 00:35:00,950
home position with 80 to wireless

659
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:03,680
organization and it has a before

660
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:07,220
remember 802 dot11 had about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 300 and</font>

661
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,348
let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> seventy voting members well</font>

662
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:14,930
dot 15 only has about a hundred and

663
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:18,650
something maybe around 100 but um but<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

664
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:21,410
many ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> two groups are run a similar</font>

665
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:22,589
but they're not absolutely the same but

666
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:27,299
there's a lot of similar

667
00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:29,369
are these<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay oh one thing I should</font>

668
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:31,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">have mentioned before I remember I</font>

669
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:35,130
mentioned a little bit about well for

670
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:37,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">instance in this if you have a document</font>

671
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:41,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">or specification then the task group</font>

672
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:44,279
first of all get a document that's ready

673
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:46,710
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation to the working group</font>

674
00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:49,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the working group in our case is 82</font>

675
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:51,809
that 15 for instance one task group

676
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:56,609
recently finished<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a layer 2 routing</font>

677
00:35:51,809 --> 00:36:00,450
and so then that 15 makes comments on it

678
00:35:56,609 --> 00:36:02,819
and then after that's done it sent up to

679
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:04,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">our sponsor and our sponsor is at the</font>

680
00:36:02,819 --> 00:36:07,288
next higher level of this organizational

681
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:10,259
chart which is 80 to local and

682
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:13,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">metropolitan area networks LMS see which</font>

683
00:36:10,259 --> 00:36:16,289
if you remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that thing on mentor is</font>

684
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:18,348
one of them document subdivisions on

685
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:23,549
mentor which leads you to a tour 2011

686
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:26,339
about 15 so sponsor is in a way

687
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:28,349
providing the legitimacy for the

688
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:32,130
standardization<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort if i can say it</font>

689
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:34,769
that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> and by the way if you want to</font>

690
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:37,079
be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> member of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Tripoli standards</font>

691
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:39,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">Association you just have to pay fifty</font>

692
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,069
dollars a year and they will let you

693
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:46,288
make comments and all those documents

694
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:48,538
it's so open for all participation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

695
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:52,410
so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scope and purpose of 80 to</font>

696
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:54,869
15 activities focused on wearable

697
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:57,629
devices to start off which were personal

698
00:36:54,869 --> 00:37:00,599
area networks or pans and but that's

699
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:03,150
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really outgrown that a lot and</font>

700
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:06,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really attending much more towards</font>

701
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:10,410
I guess process control and IOT sort of

702
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:14,690
things so the data rates are a wide wide

703
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:17,940
range of data rates and long-range

704
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:20,430
communications and 100 megahertz a

705
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,479
hundred terahertz<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

706
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:24,299
aware of anything at<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight hundred</font>

707
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:29,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">terahertz and then to ask Bob about that</font>

708
00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:33,989
but it's anyway a wide range yeah I

709
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:36,210
guess so there is an optical<font color="#E5E5E5"> no owc</font>

710
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:41,580
optical wireless communication

711
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:44,460
effort there good point thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

712
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:46,440
so they stopped focusing directly on

713
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,630
personal area networks but specialty

714
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,820
networks and I'm not sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly what</font>

715
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:54,510
that word is supposed to mean but it

716
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:57,690
probably means whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not some</font>

717
00:37:54,510 --> 00:38:00,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">not wireless LAN so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well typically</font>

718
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:02,880
short-range communications and bob says

719
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:05,609
if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not land man ran or wind and</font>

720
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,440
it's probably 80 to about 15 and there's

721
00:38:05,609 --> 00:38:08,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">one distinguishing characteristics will</font>

722
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,220
all show a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

723
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,800
later is it it's only working group with

724
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:16,140
multiple Mac layers but just as a show

725
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:21,869
can I question how many people here know

726
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:24,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">what Mac layer is ok please see now</font>

727
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:27,780
you're both to stop me and ask questions

728
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:29,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mac layer is media access control and</font>

729
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,980
what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> means is that when you extend to</font>

730
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:33,690
pack it down from IP it's got a bunch of

731
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,990
bits in it but you can't send it unless

732
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:39,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can actually obtain a medium on</font>

733
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:40,830
which to send those bits and that means

734
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:43,129
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's got have you got to fit into</font>

735
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:48,000
the scheduling<font color="#E5E5E5"> just resource and them</font>

736
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:50,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">then the wireless or wired media has to</font>

737
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,560
be actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a time at which it</font>

738
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:55,259
can be sent out on the medium<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

739
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,630
frequency upon which it can be carried

740
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:00,359
and all that stuff has a big court it's

741
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:03,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">just it's a matter of protocol just like</font>

742
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:07,259
IETF works on protocol but it's protocol

743
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,970
you must say restricted usually to one

744
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:12,359
link or in other words the medium

745
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:14,339
between two neighbors so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

746
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:16,970
crucial thing to understand about I

747
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:20,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tripoli's that they spend a lot of time</font>

748
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:23,790
with optimal scheduling of the medium

749
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:25,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">and also fairness you want to have the</font>

750
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:29,099
medium to be scheduled fairly so that

751
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:32,640
all contenders are allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get on to</font>

752
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:34,349
that medium and make use of it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

753
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">guess that's as much as I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

754
00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:38,820
about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now but I've urge you</font>

755
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,950
please if I make a technology or a

756
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,750
statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> like Mac layer and you don't</font>

757
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:46,049
understand it you have to stop me

758
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:48,970
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise what I can't get the</font>

759
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:53,109
message across<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

760
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:56,230
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about 15 completed projects</font>

761
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:58,690
well they originally did something for

762
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:01,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bluetooth and then them people were</font>

763
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:03,520
using that for a while dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eric</font>

764
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">erickson was using it too but for some</font>

765
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:10,960
reason there was divergence between 80

766
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:13,200
to 15 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ericsson and then the zigbee</font>

767
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,530
came along and did something else again

768
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:20,430
so and again there's a strong

769
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:22,930
requirement for dot 15 and dot 11 to

770
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:26,589
interact beneficially and share the

771
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:31,330
medium so that's a coexistence document

772
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:36,550
dot 3 is a high rate version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80 20 15</font>

773
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:39,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's still and quite active use and</font>

774
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:42,119
then they actually decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use Mac of</font>

775
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:46,390
mac addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> 48 good mac</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses I</font>

776
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:49,480
don't know so one thing I it's not here

777
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:51,730
but about<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot 15 of design philosophy</font>

778
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,380
for a long time was we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

779
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:55,990
do anything for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

780
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:59,560
to do all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that Mac layer stuff up in</font>

781
00:40:55,990 --> 00:41:03,160
the are a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

782
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:07,029
interpreting multicast or are you might

783
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:10,089
say fragmentation and so on all that

784
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:12,339
stuff has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done outside of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our spec</font>

785
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:14,770
well the natural result of that is that

786
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:16,630
all these crucial things that have to

787
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:19,420
happen like for instance fragmentation

788
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:20,920
got done in more than one way and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

789
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:22,300
they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to backtrack off of that</font>

790
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,760
and actually provide standardized

791
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:27,460
mechanisms for some a lot of common

792
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:33,880
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be done beneficially</font>

793
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:35,859
below below the layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so on they</font>

794
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:39,640
also go in the other direction low rate

795
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:43,650
stuff for energy-efficient hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

796
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:46,900
on and is always personal area network

797
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:49,359
so here's a list of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot for</font>

798
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:52,180
completed projects dot far as you can

799
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:58,650
see had been the center of a huge amount

800
00:41:52,180 --> 00:42:01,279
of activity in<font color="#E5E5E5"> not reply 802 they had</font>

801
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:04,100
ultra-wideband<font color="#CCCCCC"> Phi</font>

802
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:09,910
of a special<font color="#E5E5E5"> vyas physical layer in</font>

803
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:13,549
depth where you get down to enabling the

804
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:16,629
discrimination between noise and actual

805
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:19,460
bits and what is the modulation

806
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:22,370
technique that's going on and what's the

807
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:25,370
frequency band and what is they<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

808
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:26,870
what are the regulatory requirements for

809
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:29,450
instance that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government gets in</font>

810
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:34,040
there and they can tell you and you can

811
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:37,850
do a carrier sensing for this amount of

812
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:42,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">time or you have to well anyway so</font>

813
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:45,380
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like that and I</font>

814
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:46,910
had to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you I'm not aware of most of</font>

815
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,710
what the technical content of these

816
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:52,700
computer projects because a lot of more

817
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:55,880
done before I started coming in 2010 so

818
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:59,029
I will not go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much detail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

819
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:01,850
that well just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mission one last</font>

820
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:03,710
thing down here<font color="#CCCCCC"> just dot you I think</font>

821
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:06,440
this was set the world record for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

822
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:08,780
fastest standardization they started

823
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,910
like a year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a half ago and I only</font>

824
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:13,880
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do was to put in this band in</font>

825
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:15,379
India so you could use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> later 2015 so</font>

826
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:19,730
there wasn't much question about how to

827
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:23,570
do them more completed projects this

828
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:26,030
revision see sofra 802 dot 15 it's the

829
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:28,360
same importance we want and in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

830
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:30,860
avoid having to go to so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

831
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,660
documents to good answers they roll up

832
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:35,630
all the amendments here you can see

833
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:39,950
these seven different amendments into

834
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:44,630
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end this was just finished about a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">really as my understanding is it's a lot</font>

840
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:02,030
more like you come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put your</font>

00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:05,480
device<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the movie and you download a</font>

842
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:07,960
movie across a very short link or

843
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like that</font>

844
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:16,000

845
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:18,670
quite many people in ITF and he was the

says key management protocol but what it

848
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,580
really boils down to is a container

849
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,859
protocol for key management so it allows

850
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:34,869
you to do key management in multiple

851
00:44:29,859 --> 00:44:39,580
various ways a tour through dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1510 is</font>

done it's just finished with sponsor

855
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:52,089

a few minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank you ok so anyway</font>

895
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:09,980
with faster faster and low rate actual

896
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:12,050
CPUs and processors you can get a lot

<font color="#E5E5E5">more mileage and so we now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have now had</font>

900
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:25,879
take long to do that one I'm the

00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:31,910
remember i mentioned about dot v dot u

903
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:33,589
which is only for india well when they

904
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:35,420
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the process for india they</font>

905
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:37,580
discovered hey there's a lot of other

906
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:39,650
countries and event regulatory changes

907
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:42,920
too so let's go make these things

908
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:46,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">available for mexico and brazil and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font>

909
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:48,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">zealand and all that so this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

910
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:51,740
basically done that's going in for

911
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:55,700
sponsor ballot and should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

912
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:58,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">next few months now i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to also point</font>

913
00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:00,799
out that i'm aware<font color="#CCCCCC"> that probably you</font>

914
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:03,230
don't care about a lot of stuff but you

915
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,810
have to know what I Triple E is there to

916
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:09,100
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> these sort of frequency bands and</font>

917
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:12,529
five layers available for use and

918
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:14,540
hopefully it will never boil up to

919
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:19,970
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really matters it the</font>

920
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:22,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">network layer and above</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok Oh question</font>

921
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:22,180
yes

922
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:36,960
you know I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be honest until you</font>

923
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:38,520
only heard about half of your words so

924
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:51,450
if you could you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> it louder or come</font>

925
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:53,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the mic so we have different</font>

926
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:55,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">frequency bands that are specific to</font>

927
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:58,830
geographic regions so if you have

928
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:04,050
devices say in Brazil they won't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

929
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:05,970
China oh well so you asked some<font color="#CCCCCC"> letters</font>

930
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:08,700
devices that use all these frequency

931
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:11,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">bands yeah well there's not because they</font>

932
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:13,259
haven't been standardized and so every

933
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:15,060
one of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to have some sort of</font>

934
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:19,080
rule about what is the center frequency

935
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:23,549
and where the power allowances and where

936
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:27,720
the guard bands<font color="#E5E5E5"> am well maybe Stewart</font>

937
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:29,730
has some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more to add about that well if</font>

938
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,470
I understood your question correctly<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

939
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:33,840
think i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> add something about that</font>

940
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:36,180
there are already radio devices that are

941
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:40,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">legal in one country that are not legal</font>

942
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:43,649
in other countries and even 80 2011

943
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:46,650
Wi-Fi has this property that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Japan I</font>

944
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:49,710
think channel 14 is allowed but in the

945
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:51,450
United States<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not and most Wi-Fi</font>

946
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:53,850
devices because they're on mobile

947
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:55,950
devices in<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the old</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> days you could</font>

948
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:58,020
sell a product in<font color="#CCCCCC"> one country and assume</font>

949
00:49:55,950 --> 00:50:00,270
it would never leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> that country things</font>

950
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:01,950
are more<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile now so now there's</font>

951
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:05,430
actually communication with the access

952
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:07,770
point so the access point will tell your

953
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:11,520
phone which channels it's allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

954
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:13,230
based on the geography and then you

955
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,910
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy an access point in Japan and</font>

956
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:16,620
take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the US and you would then be</font>

957
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:18,870
breaking the law in the US by using that

958
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:23,700
access point so this is an issue that

959
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:25,790
people have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of ok thank</font>

960
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font>

961
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:35,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so dot seven is uh it's not dot 11</font>

962
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,770
it's not da 15 Oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> women I'm sure but it</font>

963
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:43,000
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not 15 and there's a similar group in</font>

964
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:46,150
dot 11 for this but it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not 82</font>

965
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:51,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">at 15 dot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 so it's not related to the</font>

966
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:53,079
low-power<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot dot forward anyway so they</font>

967
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,810
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> also some optical wireless</font>

968
00:50:53,079 --> 00:51:00,339
communications with visible light and

969
00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:02,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is they also have some discussion</font>

970
00:51:00,339 --> 00:51:04,180
in that group I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't been</font>

971
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:06,250
this group very much but apparently you

972
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:09,098
can just take two cameras and cause them

973
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:14,740
to be also communicating packets over

974
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:16,630
there optical links those then there's

975
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:18,669
this pier aware communication which I

976
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:21,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">really don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very much to say about</font>

977
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:23,260
I think it's not only infrastructure

978
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:26,759
list but also I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

979
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:31,869
have any sort of forwarding or hop

980
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:34,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-hop operation so I have a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

981
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:36,970
to say about 12 this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a relatively new</font>

982
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:40,270
thing we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> got we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just started</font>

983
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:41,859
first meeting a few months<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I mean</font>

984
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:43,599
our first meeting is a task group before

985
00:51:41,859 --> 00:51:47,319
that there was an interest group in a

986
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:51,190
study group so this is bound effort here

987
00:51:47,319 --> 00:51:54,310
is to repair some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lack from 80 to</font>

988
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:57,190
about 15 from a long time ago to try to

989
00:51:54,310 --> 00:52:00,790
actually provide standardized way to use

990
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:05,920
the various Phi and Mac layer so beta 2

991
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:08,380
dot 15 so the vision was to simplify the

992
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:12,310
use of not for now right now this is

993
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:14,950
only for dot for it could go to dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 as</font>

994
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:19,900
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know about seven</font>

995
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:23,828
yet but anyway the point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we want</font>

996
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:25,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">to allow Rican a simple reconfiguration</font>

997
00:52:23,829 --> 00:52:27,190
and using essentially for instance that

998
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:29,200
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to use the same</font>

999
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:33,250
device driver no matter which country

1000
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:36,810
you're in as one example so um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

1001
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:38,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the idea and um</font>

1002
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:42,360
want to be able to use the various

1003
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:45,150
protocol stacks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same way that 11</font>

1004
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:49,100
and 3 use him without changing depending

1005
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:51,030
upon you might say lower level details

1006
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:52,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and we also want to maintain</font>

1007
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:55,500
backward compatibility with existing

1008
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:57,630
attitude about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 dot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 devices and</font>

1009
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:00,810
applications plus we're going to take

1010
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:05,240
layer to routing and a campy this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

1011
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:09,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">nine and from ITF we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

1012
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:12,209
enabling 6lowpan and sixth ish all in up

1013
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:16,080
with the same upper layer interface work

1014
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:18,450
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this is a this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is really</font>

1015
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:21,380
interesting word for ITF and when we

1016
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:23,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a lot of the you might say yum</font>

1017
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:28,110
interest group and study group effort

1018
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:30,900
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you li was done we were talking with</font>

1019
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:35,640
folks from 62 ish and six<font color="#CCCCCC"> lo all along</font>

1020
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:37,920
the way so what it does is to give the

1021
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:40,440
15 24 devices well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I already</font>

1022
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,570
said this person standard interfaces and

1023
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:46,500
primitives in a modular way modular

1024
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:53,070
meaning that you can add new features

1025
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:56,180
inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1512 as people decide to do the</font>

1026
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:59,760
word it's just s effort as an example

1027
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:02,240
you might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to be that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dot 12 does</font>

1028
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:07,860
ranging no matter what the specific

1029
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:09,810
frequency ranges and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and one thing</font>

1030
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:12,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be part of this is to</font>

1031
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:20,610
use either type and<font color="#CCCCCC"> The Dispatch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ID so</font>

1032
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:22,919
that we can package that come in will be

1033
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:25,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to specify in the same way that</font>

1034
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:27,420
either type does for you can either type

1035
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:29,190
will tell you what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the where to send the</font>

1036
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:30,870
packet and not a protocol stack and we

1037
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:37,020
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same feature for dot for</font>

1038
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:38,460
a tour to dot 1504<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so fragmentation</font>

1039
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:42,420
is going to assume well me we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1040
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:44,040
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to specify fragmentation</font>

1041
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:47,220
because 6lowpan already has a

1042
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:50,400
fragmentation capability and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do too</font>

1043
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:53,350
dot 15 dot nine already<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a</font>

1044
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:56,080
fragmentation capability but we have to

1045
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:59,040
allow it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to all coexist so that the</font>

1046
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:01,120
higher layers don't care that much and

1047
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:04,509
as mentioned we're going to include

1048
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:07,480
layer to routing and KMP is as part of

1049
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:09,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so I've got seven minutes left how</font>

1050
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:12,510
much more material do I have I knew this

1051
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:15,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">was going to happen and please I still</font>

1052
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:16,630
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have questions even if I'm not</font>

1053
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:22,029
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to finish all the slides please</font>

1054
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:23,770
don't don't hesitate to stop and ask so

1055
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:25,420
I have a picture which I'll show shortly

1056
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:27,759
but what we're going to do what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1057
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:31,980
is essentially an architecture to allow

1058
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:34,990
a modular extension and<font color="#CCCCCC"> The Dispatch</font>

1059
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:39,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">capability plus the interface to the mac</font>

1060
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:42,069
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> phy layers that can be done in a way</font>

1061
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:47,230
that we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> make forward</font>

1062
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:50,230
progress and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned about to</font>

1063
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:53,200
regulate<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so eater type is to help</font>

1064
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:56,080
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know using multiple protocol</font>

1065
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:59,189
stacks on top of 15 dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> for and I should</font>

1066
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:02,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">also emphasize that we want to avoid</font>

1067
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:05,170
problems with having to have high layer

1068
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:08,740
knowledge of low layer regulatory

1069
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:11,890
requirements so here's a picture that's

1070
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:15,009
got way too much information but Pat

1071
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:17,109
Kenny insisted<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show it so I'll try</font>

1072
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:19,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">to parse it out a little bit so here</font>

1073
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:20,860
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have v6 stuff coming down</font>

1074
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:24,580
and take them to keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind this is</font>

1075
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:27,520
all I do to doc 15 dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 and that means</font>

1076
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:32,259
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down here the mac layer stuff is 15</font>

1077
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:35,950
24 and the file layer it's 15 dot 4 so

1078
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:38,380
for example of some of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> four new</font>

1079
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:42,750
amendments are enlarging the ability for

1080
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:46,960
more file layer to be included<font color="#CCCCCC"> in them</font>

1081
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:50,890
1504 so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a simple example we have</font>

1082
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:52,630
v6 my contention is that most v6 or

1083
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:57,040
maybe all of these six is going to be

1084
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:59,200
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> down through 6lowpan into for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1085
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,850
only way that wouldn't happen is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1086
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,980
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> of princeton's get a better</font>

1087
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,848
compression technique and it's not

1088
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,579
standardized

1089
00:57:03,849 --> 00:57:08,890
6lowpan or something like that but

1090
00:57:06,579 --> 00:57:12,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyway we have modular blocks for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> native</font>

1091
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:17,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">code 59 which is key management</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

1092
00:57:12,249 --> 00:57:20,529
dot1x six top is a sixth ish interface

1093
00:57:17,769 --> 00:57:23,618
to allow the scheduled time scheduled

1094
00:57:20,529 --> 00:57:25,779
operation l to our lair to routing is

1095
00:57:23,619 --> 00:57:28,119
mesh under and then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> management</font>

1096
00:57:25,779 --> 00:57:29,829
protocol is it showed as a regular

1097
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:32,380
square box but it's actually large

1098
00:57:29,829 --> 00:57:34,930
because there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 15 dot 4</font>

1099
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:37,420
parameters that have to be set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up mostly</font>

1100
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:41,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">with default values but they have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

1101
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:44,589
done and so our<font color="#E5E5E5"> task with 12 is to allow</font>

1102
00:57:41,789 --> 00:57:47,890
those things to be done regardless of

1103
00:57:44,589 --> 00:57:50,680
the mac layer and Phi layer and then

1104
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:53,680
this we also want to allow essentially a

1105
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:56,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">pass through operations so that when 12</font>

1106
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,328
doesn't have anything to do Packers will

1107
00:57:56,049 --> 00:58:01,930
just flow out to the proper mac and phy

1108
00:57:58,329 --> 00:58:03,999
layer and this diagram by the way is in

1109
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:07,379
flux<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is where we've been</font>

1110
00:58:03,999 --> 00:58:11,078
focusing our efforts at several months

1111
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:12,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well that's enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for about 12 I</font>

1112
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:15,940
have one<font color="#CCCCCC"> more really important thing I</font>

1113
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:19,180
want to mention we have interest groups

1114
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:21,670
in 82 at 15 um there's one about

1115
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:23,879
dependability this is actually seem to

1116
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:27,190
be picking up a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of steam a</font>

1117
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:29,019
recent presentation by the way you can

1118
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:32,109
get all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this on mentor if you go into</font>

1119
00:58:29,019 --> 00:58:34,390
a row 2 15 and look in them there's a

1120
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:36,339
pulldown menu for the interest groups

1121
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:38,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the task groups and one of them is I</font>

1122
00:58:36,339 --> 00:58:43,269
GDP and so you can go get<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the stuff</font>

1123
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:47,200
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so this could be an important</font>

1124
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:49,660
effort but reliability well if you're

1125
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:52,749
doing vehicular for instance you kind of

1126
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:55,149
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually works</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

1127
00:58:52,749 --> 00:58:57,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">speed are high rate rail communications</font>

1128
00:58:55,150 --> 00:59:00,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't pay much attention to that the</font>

1129
00:58:57,759 --> 00:59:03,400
terahertz interest group<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't</font>

1130
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:07,059
followed that but low-power wide area I

1131
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:12,239
have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> following and here this is</font>

1132
00:59:07,059 --> 00:59:15,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually just recently turned into a</font>

1133
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:17,560
study group so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it should be</font>

1134
00:59:15,819 --> 00:59:20,380
changed<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a study group</font>

1135
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:22,270
so low power wide area networks are very

1136
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:28,450
interesting for many applications in

1137
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:31,900
them tomorrow blp<font color="#CCCCCC"> win a meeting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up for a</font>

1138
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:34,689
rum in ffort there's a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group</font>

1139
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:35,890
in IETF for help you win and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> prom</font>

1140
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:38,020
the thing is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot of</font>

1141
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:40,660
proprietary interest in this stuff too

1142
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:42,850
and so we want to find out what our gaps

1143
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:46,390
are so there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of discussion in</font>

1144
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:50,049
this LP wa and i should say study group

1145
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:52,390
about finding what work if any needs to

1146
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:55,660
be done at on Tripoli a tour through

1147
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:57,640
wireless area because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> any gaps and</font>

1148
00:59:55,660 --> 01:00:00,549
their existing standards and maybe there

1149
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:03,430
maybe there aren't any we'll we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

1150
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:06,400
it's not an effort to create work it's

1151
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:11,560
an effort to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be responsible to our our</font>

1152
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:13,930
customers so for instance may have able

1153
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:15,970
to have 15 20 4 K and G which has

1154
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:18,640
already been<font color="#CCCCCC"> done as part of a total</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1155
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:23,049
fifteen for standard we have cig<font color="#CCCCCC"> Foxin</font>

1156
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:27,670
and Laura and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Etsy has some efforts and</font>

1157
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:29,770
the 3gpp as his narrow band<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT and one</font>

1158
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:31,060
of my things to do recently has been to

1159
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:33,780
learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this but I don't know</font>

1160
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:37,690
anything about mbio to right now and

1161
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:43,510
there's also a<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-power group minute or</font>

1162
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:46,770
two title Evan so let the on LP wa will

1163
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:49,270
do is to we already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have got scenarios</font>

1164
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:51,640
for the kind of work that should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done</font>

1165
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:54,009
look at the channel interference models

1166
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:56,970
and this you might consider this to be

1167
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:59,290
also an exercise in coexistence and

1168
01:00:56,970 --> 01:01:02,620
actually look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the performance of what</font>

1169
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:06,009
we have now so I'm now down 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes</font>

couple of things 802 wireless is

1212
01:03:26,349 --> 01:03:32,739
actually there's an executive committee

1213
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:34,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">a study group for 5g and they've been</font>

1214
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:37,539
spending a lot of time trying to figure

1215
01:03:34,359 --> 01:03:43,270
out how best to tackle the problem they

1216
01:03:37,539 --> 01:03:46,760
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know whether or not too closely</font>

align their efforts with 3gpp<font color="#E5E5E5"> are to</font>

simply try to avoid any<font color="#CCCCCC"> major conflict</font>

1219
01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:58,310
or how to beneficially engage and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

1220

has a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people whose job it is to</font>

mac layers and those physical layers

really produce the bits in the proper
