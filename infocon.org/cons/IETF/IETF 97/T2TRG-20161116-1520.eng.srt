00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:45,530
little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a minute</font>

door close the door thank you so this is

28
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:11,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">an IR TF meeting so we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our own IP</font>

29
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">our guidelines but they are the same</font>

30
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,320
that the IETF uses but<font color="#E5E5E5"> do look them up</font>

31
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:24,640
and show them through your lawyer and

32
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:28,030
all that right yeah i just want to point

33
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">out the research group has a mailing</font>

34
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:33,340
list and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little trap here</font>

35
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,779
because all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our stuff of course ends</font>

36
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:39,250
with ad<font color="#CCCCCC"> i RT f dot org except</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

37
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,010
so sometimes you have to look a little

38
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:45,989
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> closer whether there is an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ietf</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dot</font>

40
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:54,100
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite importantly we tend to put</font>

41
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,989
our meetings on github so each meeting

42
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,239
has its own repository and the

43
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:05,200
repository for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting is github</font>

44
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:08,950
com /t to TRG / 2016 desh ITF 97 so

45
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:14,470
there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the slides</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

46
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:18,120
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at we have only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one hour so</font>

47
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:22,510
we have a pretty compressed agenda but

48
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,830
still if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a question please ask</font>

49
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:28,150
it

50
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:32,710
we will get a quick update on the web of

51
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:35,219
things activity and the w3c we will talk

52
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:38,169
about the security considerations

53
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:41,500
document which is probably the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

54
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:46,508
<font color="#CCCCCC">substantial document that we have agreed</font>

55
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:48,729
as a research group to work on we will

56
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:52,389
discuss the rest for design and

57
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:55,900
hypermedia subject there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a number of</font>

58
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:58,930
documents here one may become a research

59
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:02,469
group document very soon and other a

60
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:05,400
little bit more exploration<font color="#CCCCCC"> l in nature</font>

61
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:09,250
and finally we will have a quick

62
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,849
discussion about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a yang as an</font>

63
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,770
interaction model for coming again<font color="#E5E5E5"> none</font>

64
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:20,289
of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking here</font>

65
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:23,969
about here are standards but some of

66
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:26,259
them do try to gather a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of a</font>

67
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:30,520
consensus for instance the security

68
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:33,729
considerations probably do collect

69
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:38,460
information that many people have been

70
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:41,919
collecting over the last couple of years

71
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:44,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay okay what is the research group</font>

72
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,740
about the thing to think research group

73
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:53,080
was officially chartered a year ago in

74
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:56,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">December 2015 and we look at open</font>

75
00:05:53,080 --> 00:06:00,099
research issues in<font color="#CCCCCC"> telling a true</font>

76
00:05:56,529 --> 00:06:02,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet of Things into a reality so I</font>

77
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:07,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know who he was there on tuesday</font>

78
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:12,520
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> i sock panel a few think you</font>

79
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:14,500
missed something so we are interested in

80
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,500
making an<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet a reality where low</font>

81
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,810
resource nodes are full citizens are not

82
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:23,080
just devices that can can talk to or to

83
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:26,379
a big brother in the cloud but actually

84
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:29,529
can interact are maintaining some of the

85
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:31,509
invariance of the internet and of course

86
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:34,719
within this really big subject we focus

87
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:36,969
on issues with opportunities for ITF

88
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:37,240
standardization but we do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> folds</font>

89
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:39,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">tech</font>

90
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,220
so if somebody comes with an adaptation

91
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:45,580
layer problem we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> as interested in</font>

92
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:50,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">that as when somebody comes and wants to</font>

93
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:52,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about human rights issues in think</font>

94
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,099
of thing communication don't know how

95
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:59,800
that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> work but we were find</font>

96
00:06:54,099 --> 00:07:02,710
something ok so<font color="#E5E5E5"> again we were chartered</font>

97
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:08,380
a year goal we have had a pretty full

98
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:10,810
calendar this year so we have done

99
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:15,400
research group meetings partially

100
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:17,800
co-located with w3c we have had one

101
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:21,840
co-located with the IAB semantic

102
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:25,419
interoperability workshop we had

103
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,818
meetings<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the ITF at the ITF</font>

104
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:31,419
locations we participated in the

105
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:34,240
software update workshop<font color="#E5E5E5"> the riot</font>

107
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,759
us is very much of interest to us so we

108
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:44,110
just recently had a implementers meeting

109
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,610
with the Eclipse con conference which

110
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">was very interesting in particular there</font>

111
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:51,099
were lots of lightweight m2m people

112
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:56,919
there and we just had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> joint meeting</font>

113
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:59,020
with IC energy a couple of days<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so</font>

114
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:03,039
we have three deliverables in progress

115
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:05,229
we will talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> two and we are really</font>

116
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">also interested in outreach so for</font>

119
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:14,710
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we talk to other</font>

120
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,650
organizations that are doing interesting

121
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:20,609
things in this space and we have a

122
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:23,739
pretty intimate relationship with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a w3c</font>

123
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:29,560
activity because that is very close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

124
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:33,430
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems that we have to solve yeah</font>

125
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:38,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to skip this slide for lack of</font>

126
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:43,239
time our 2017 planning is wide open so

127
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:46,209
we kind of did our calendar for 2016 but

128
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:50,230
the next step will actually be a finding

129
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:52,510
opportunities in 2017 to meet again

130
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:56,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sure we will use the the summer</font>

131
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:58,780
meeting for something interesting but

132
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:04,540
really we haven't really schedule with

133
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:08,980
that very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much yet so on the meeting we</font>

134
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:11,890
had on Sunday we had a joint meeting

135
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:15,070
with IC energy for two and a half<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours</font>

136
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:16,990
two and a half hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not much in</font>

137
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,830
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> if two established</font>

138
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:25,360
communities meet each other for the

139
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:28,950
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> time in a room but I see energy</font>

140
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,170
has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of perspective on iog already</font>

141
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:34,660
but of course with a view to we have

142
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:38,770
this hammer and and how is IOT a nail

143
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:41,579
and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing research group on</font>

144
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:45,189
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand has grappled with issues</font>

145
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:48,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are just the the stable issues of</font>

146
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:51,310
the ice energy such as data naming and

147
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:54,310
so on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes sense for us to talk</font>

148
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:57,489
to each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we presented a couple</font>

149
00:09:54,310 --> 00:10:01,650
of we had presentations for a couple of

150
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:06,760
ICN IOT project and discussed different

151
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:08,980
aspects of semantics and security so

152
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,350
again this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> only 12 hours we didn't</font>

153
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,840
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> very far but it seemed to us that we</font>

154
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:17,290
will continue that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I expect us to</font>

155
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:20,740
have further joint meetings with IC

156
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:23,290
energy in the future it might we might

157
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">even want to have cross review of</font>

158
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,540
documents there is an IOT architecture

159
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,000
document being prepared by IC energy so

160
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:34,030
maybe that's something we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will look at</font>

161
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:39,820
so this was the agenda we had for

162
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:42,449
research talks and the the for me

163
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:46,320
personally very interesting talk was by

164
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:51,880
thomas smith about an industrial

165
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:56,950
application of ICN and then we we went

166
00:10:51,880 --> 00:11:00,210
into a discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that so much</font>

167
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:02,920
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> status of the working group of</font>

168
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:04,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> research group</font>

169
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,010
Lee Howard I'm sorry for interrupting

170
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,388
I've noticed we have several people

171
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:09,610
standing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back who can't find</font>

172
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:11,649
seats and I've noticed we have a lot of

173
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:14,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">people putting stuff on seats next to</font>

174
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:15,730
them can you can people please up make

175
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:20,040
room and raise your hand to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get this</font>

176
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:25,750
chair next to you on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a chair come in</font>

177
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:32,649
you're welcome thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that's a good</font>

178
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:37,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">point well thanks for representing</font>

179
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:42,670
Kirsten I'll wait until<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone found a</font>

180
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:44,589
seat and we refilled the row in the back

181
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:54,339
and there were some seats left if you

182
00:11:44,589 --> 00:12:06,220
looking for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you don't have to</font>

183
00:11:54,339 --> 00:12:08,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">have read the draft oh I just start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

184
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:13,570
yeah I've some updates on the Bible

185
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:15,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">finks activity at w3c so just recap what</font>

186
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,470
is this about so the mission is

187
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,470
definitely not you to create a new

188
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:23,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">standard in a w3c for this so we aware</font>

189
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,730
that there is a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> affectivity so</font>

190
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,430
they're a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of alliances and and</font>

191
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,440
platforms out there what we try to do is

192
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:31,750
create building blocks that are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

193
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,000
complement those existing standards out

194
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,440
there to ease the integration of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,079
different platforms that we have across

196
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,760
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> different application domains and</font>

197
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:41,949
the central<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is to provide a</font>

198
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,410
semantic metadata for the existing

199
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:46,329
platforms so that we can describe how to

200
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:50,410
interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things office</font>

201
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:53,140
specific platform and another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we</font>

202
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,939
want to tackle<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how you develop IOT</font>

203
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,610
applications so that it becomes easier

204
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,230
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually write applications for for</font>

205
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,510
the Internet of Things and to get

206
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:04,060
ultimately in something<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to the</font>

207
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:06,579
web browser that is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> runtime for web</font>

208
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:11,170
applications but have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for</font>

209
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:13,359
actually things and for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

210
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently targeting at those building</font>

211
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,790
blocks so we have to vote scripting API

212
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:18,829
so that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

213
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,599
some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of common</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> API that you can</font>

214
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,250
write an application against and that

215
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,860
should then run on different things

216
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:27,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">again it's a building block so you not</font>

217
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:29,180
forced to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick that or implement that</font>

218
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,250
but it's something if you say you want

219
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,040
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support this this is something you</font>

220
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:36,350
can integrate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in your platform and</font>

221
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,060
then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next thing probably the central</font>

222
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:43,070
part is the map of things fing

223
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:45,530
description so this leverages semantic

224
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:48,410
technologies to to describe how

225
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:50,930
interfaces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things work so on the one</font>

226
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:53,709
hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is this support for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

227
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:56,150
scripting<font color="#E5E5E5"> API</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a sore so you need to</font>

228
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,600
parse these fing descriptions and then

229
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:01,370
ya want to write code<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can actually</font>

230
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,110
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this so for that we have the</font>

231
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,270
connection up to the scripting API from

232
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,940
this fing description and we have these

233
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:10,960
protocol mappings so for instance a lot

234
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:14,300
of platforms leverage co-op so there's a

235
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,070
co-op binding for 192 m for instance ocf

236
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,630
users co-op but they use go up in a

237
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,850
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> way and what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> try to do in</font>

238
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:21,590
these mappings is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe how to use</font>

239
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,930
go up in a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> way so that you can</font>

240
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:25,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a vanilla co-op stack and then</font>

241
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,609
produce messages that will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> understood</font>

242
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:32,360
by the ocf device or by the one fom

243
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:34,430
device and this is then in the end also

244
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of this finger scription so you see</font>

245
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:38,540
the finger scription is basically the

246
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:41,060
central part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of or the central building</font>

247
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:43,640
block and for application development it

248
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:46,099
extends to the scripting<font color="#CCCCCC"> api and for the</font>

249
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,260
interconnection it goes down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

250
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">protocol meh things to do yeah create</font>

251
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:54,110
messages that will be understood<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

252
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:57,589
kind of yeah part of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these is</font>

253
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:59,270
security and privacy so we also want to

254
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,190
provide means to describe the security

255
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:03,620
mechanisms that are used by the thing

256
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,900
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have their checks that you can</font>

257
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:10,700
write applications that yeah are able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

258
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:14,510
express privacy needs for instance so

259
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:17,150
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this work organized in w3c so for</font>

260
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:20,120
one and a half years we have now the web

261
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:22,490
of things interest group which is mainly

262
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,950
for exploration so looking at technology

263
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,560
out there and identifying building

264
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,930
blocks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might be worth as</font>

265
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,680
standardizing and it's the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> group</font>

266
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,329
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is open</font>

267
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,750
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> collaboration so we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

268
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:38,960
quite a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of lazing on going so</font>

269
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:41,060
with the one m2m with the OPC foundation

270
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:46,399
and we're currently setting something up

271
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:50,209
with the with<font color="#E5E5E5"> OC f and gas so we exist</font>

272
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:53,540
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> april 2015 we were retarted in</font>

273
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:56,149
august this year with the more long-term

274
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:59,270
run and to set up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proposed</font>

275
00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:02,690
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> groups which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i will introduce in</font>

276
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:05,209
a few minutes or<font color="#E5E5E5"> one minute probably by</font>

277
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,740
now we already have 210 official

278
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:10,359
participants in the group so those who

279
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:13,610
signed up<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the WC membership</font>

280
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:16,370
login and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so far we had seven</font>

281
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:19,790
face-to-face meetings started in<font color="#CCCCCC"> April</font>

00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:22,820
2015 in in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Germany</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this year we had</font>

four started in January in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nice then</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Montreal Canada in Samara in Beijing and</font>

286
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:34,910
in September there was the tip X or the

287
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:37,850
annual big meeting of the w3c where we

288

met<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as you can see here we number of</font>

00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,120
these meetings were actually joint

290
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:45,439
meetings with the thing to thing

291
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:50,170
research group so are the working group

292
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:53,240
currently it's still in proposed status

293
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,319
the working groups in wvc are those who

294
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,940
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do normative</font>

295
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,970
standardization work so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> compare</font>

296
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:01,130
it a bit WPC working group is like an

297
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,620
ITF working group at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the interest group</font>

298
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:06,349
is like an<font color="#CCCCCC"> IR TF working group so that's</font>

299
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:09,439
why the interest group also meets with

300
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:11,629
the thing to thing research group we

301
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,470
have the proposed charter it's out there

302
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:20,600
since end of<font color="#CCCCCC"> August about saying yeah so</font>

303
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:24,620
we had the AC review so that's the what

304
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:26,000
committee a committee in the w3c I

305
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:28,729
forgot the name too many abbreviations

306
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,630
that looks at<font color="#E5E5E5"> these charges and and then</font>

307
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:34,210
decides or boats<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever this should be a</font>

308
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:36,679
working or should become a working group

309
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:41,350
you can have a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the results here</font>

310
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:44,450
the summaries we have 49 supports as is

311
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:46,939
for member companies

312
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:49,130
comments but support the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chart anyway</font>

313
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:52,039
and we had two comments that would

314
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:54,100
formally then<font color="#E5E5E5"> object if you do not apply</font>

315
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:56,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">the changes they propose and that's</font>

316
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,580
basically what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing right now</font>

317
00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:02,658
we're together with w3c management

318
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:05,928
resolving those issues in summary one

319
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:08,480
was about<font color="#E5E5E5"> RDF dependency so you</font>

320
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:11,630
shouldn't force dependency on RDF or

321
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:15,320
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> heavyweight semantic frameworks</font>

322
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:20,110
and that kind of shifted to to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment</font>

323
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:22,399
that rdf word semantics classically

324
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,110
created some complexity in the setup<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

325
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:28,580
the working group order the solutions

326
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:30,678
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you work on so one thing is we do</font>

327
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">not force a dependency so it's basically</font>

328
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:35,059
an extension point because there are lot

329
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:37,070
of member companies that actually want

330
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:38,360
to provide rich semantic tooling but

331
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,519
then there are also average that just

332
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,010
want to benefit<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a common format</font>

333
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:45,350
that can be parsed by classic<font color="#CCCCCC"> jason</font>

334
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,690
parcels for instance and for the

335
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:50,539
complexity you<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically have a plan now</font>

336
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:52,850
how to a set a priority<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the different</font>

337
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:56,029
deliverables so the central one is still

338
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:59,000
the fing description and if there might

339
00:18:56,029 --> 00:19:00,529
be a conflict based on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> semantic</font>

340
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,750
frameworks in the scripting<font color="#CCCCCC"> API for</font>

341
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:05,389
instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing description itself</font>

342
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:08,480
gets priority and we have to find a

343
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:11,570
different solution or yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> adapter the</font>

344
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,419
scripting<font color="#CCCCCC"> API solution for that on the</font>

345
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:16,908
scope that's already but i present it so

346
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:19,309
the fing description itself becomes the

347
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:22,039
central piece it has the priority and

348
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:24,908
it's also what is the the greatest

349
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:27,470
interest of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the member members and</font>

350
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:29,389
the scripting<font color="#E5E5E5"> api and these protocol</font>

351
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:31,220
mappings become kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of secondary things</font>

352
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:34,340
but they are connected so you cannot

353
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:36,169
even design those independently so it

354
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:39,889
wouldn't would make any sense to not

355
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:44,600
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on those and finally they were some</font>

356
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:47,110
some security considerations or yeah

357
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:50,539
hints that yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> OT is dangerous</font>

358
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:52,399
especially with the recent attacks so

359
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:54,980
there was more emphasis on that we have

360
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:56,479
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right checks so we actually also</font>

361
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,820
established this kind of model of

362
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,580
running code in it

363
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,280
this interest group and working group so

364
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:06,179
we actually implement the drafts in

365
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,860
parallel and we are planning to have a

366
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:11,500
security testing before we actually go

367
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,540
to two new status of those documents so

368
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,030
before we have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first public</font>

369
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:19,649
reference and people have rigorous

370
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:21,790
testing and those who had the the

371
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:24,520
objections on this actually will help to

372
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:26,649
develop<font color="#CCCCCC"> a proper testing on that so it</font>

373
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,540
were basically browser vendors who had

374
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:30,760
some some issues here but they can

375
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,710
definitely also support us in coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

376
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:37,480
of the right testing how to do that how

377
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:39,730
to roll it out and yeah that's about the

378
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">update i summarize the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of links</font>

379
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:43,780
here that you can follow up to get more

380
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:45,129
information on this and I don't know if

381
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:56,680
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for questions or if they</font>

382
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:58,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">are any questions at all yeah there are</font>

383
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,910
still seats here up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the front so you</font>

384
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,770
don't have to stand<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back you can</font>

385
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:05,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">go to the front where are the blue</font>

386
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:12,820
sheets so we get a bigger room next time

387
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:22,120
make sure you<font color="#CCCCCC"> signage okay so no</font>

388
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:26,470
questions microphone now you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

389
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:28,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the microphone it's mandatory yes for</font>

390
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:37,780
the remote participation we need to use

391
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:40,660
microphones<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing from sushi</font>

392
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:43,000
diversity I want to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

393
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:48,730
participate the interest group as an

394
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,650
individual member so it depends your

395
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,920
university doesn't have any contract

396
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:57,940
various w3c so sometimes it's possible

397
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,650
to get invited experts in there but also

398
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,210
the work is public so if you follow the

399
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:05,200
links<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we are doing on</font>

400
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:08,080
on github you can yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a comment on</font>

401
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and I actually don't know what</font>

402
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,710
happens if you sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> or subscribe to the</font>

403
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:14,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">public mailing list I mean it's</font>

404
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:16,840
supposed to be public and the IP our

405
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:18,940
policy is also pretty loose or dares no

406
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,889
no policy in the interest group so

407
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,409
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we keep the the interesting</font>

408
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:25,299
work in the interest group and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

409
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:27,730
the working group is kind of the yeah

410
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:51,429
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to contact your lawyer</font>

411
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:52,960
and so on thank you wait so hello

412
00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:54,820
everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm oh it and i'll be</font>

413
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,470
presenting our draft on security

<font color="#E5E5E5">Things this work was done together with</font>

416
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:03,640
my co-authors Oscar and Sandeep who

417
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:08,080
unfortunately could not make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to this</font>

418
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:09,970
ITF so I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of you are aware</font>

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,070
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the history of this document this</font>

420
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:15,130
was recently submitted to the core

422
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:19,419
it has been decided that we will work on

423
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:24,190
this document<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the research in the tea</font>

to TRG and the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the iot</font>

425
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:29,710
related drafts would reference this

426
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:32,049
draft in the security considerations so

427
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:34,029
this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> then act as a repository for</font>

it hasn't been presented formally in the

in the key to TRG the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheers suggested</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually present what does it</font>

434
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:54,460
has been updated so I'll briefly present

435
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:57,370
what what this draft is all about so the

436
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:59,080
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing the draft contains is is the</font>

437
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:01,270
thing life cycle so which basically

438
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,730
describes the life cycle of<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet of</font>

439
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:06,429
sing-sing device you know it gets

440
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:08,919
manufactured on the factory floor it

441
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:11,350
goes through the supply chain it ends up

442
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,809
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a shop you go and buy it and</font>

443
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,820
then you need to physically install it

444
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:18,820
and Commission it so kind of run the

445
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:21,939
bootstrapping process with which it

446
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,649
would become operational and once there

447
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,169
its operational you will have things

448
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:27,610
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> software updates</font>

449
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:30,009
reconfiguration so for example if you

450
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:32,139
change<font color="#CCCCCC"> the battery then you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to run</font>

451
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:36,700
the bootstrapping process again and and

452
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:39,850
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> on once the operational cycle or the</font>

453
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:42,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">lifetime is over you decommission and</font>

454
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,830
remove it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

455
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:47,200
device is unusable so you might have a

456
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:49,090
change of ownership where you sell the

457
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,850
device<font color="#E5E5E5"> to someone else or someone else</font>

458
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:55,529
acquires you and so on the device then

459
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:59,080
continues the life cycle all over again

460
00:24:55,529 --> 00:25:01,419
so yeah we had one section describing in

461
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:06,189
all the different<font color="#E5E5E5"> phases of the law of</font>

462
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:08,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">the of the IOT device lifecycle so then</font>

463
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,960
we have a section<font color="#CCCCCC"> on on threat analysis</font>

464
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:14,889
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what kind of threats does</font>

465
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:18,070
IOT device face so we could have for

466
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:20,769
example an untrusted manufacturer or an

467
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:22,840
incompetent manufacturer you know if he

468
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:25,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">is responsible for putting the keys in</font>

469
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:29,139
your IOT device does it make a copy of

470
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:31,840
them or does he like unknowingly reveal

471
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:33,699
them and so on you have physical attacks

472
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,279
so if if your device is installed

473
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:39,700
somewhere and your neighbor goes and

474
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:41,289
replaces them or takes them home on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

475
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,869
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network level you have attacks</font>

476
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:46,419
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> East dropping and and man in the</font>

477
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:48,519
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course ifs dropping is not</font>

478
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:52,809
just a security threat it's also a

479
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:54,549
privacy threat a lot of these Internet

480
00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:56,289
of Things devices are extremely

481
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:59,049
constrained in terms of the resources

482
00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:02,200
they have so in terms of the battery or

483
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:04,720
energy or computation and so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

484
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:09,970
you can always<font color="#E5E5E5"> have denial of service or</font>

485
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,320
denial of sleep attacks then of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

486
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,990
you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do software and firmware</font>

487
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,330
updates because<font color="#E5E5E5"> these devices are going</font>

488
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,980
to be deployed for many many years but

489
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:20,408
it turns out the software and<font color="#E5E5E5"> firmware</font>

490
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:23,559
update processes or implementations may

491
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:25,299
itself be vulnerable so if you have

492
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:26,950
followed<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Internet of Things software</font>

493
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:29,799
update workshop you might have seen the

494
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:31,450
example of TR 69 which is one of these

495
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:33,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">protocols</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you use for you know</font>

496
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:35,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing updates and firmware updates which</font>

497
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,650
was found to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain holes in it</font>

498
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:41,440
and an attacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use use those two</font>

499
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:44,530
replace your your<font color="#E5E5E5"> firmware with a</font>

500
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:50,170
malicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> firmware of course there's</font>

501
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:52,270
also possibility of routing attacks so

502
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:54,820
then we have so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know what are the</font>

503
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:56,410
threats the IOT device faces and then

504
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:59,710
you know what's the challenges in

505
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:01,660
securing against these threats so the

506
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:03,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">first is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the heterogeneity so you</font>

507
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,370
have extremely resource-constrained

508
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:09,159
devices and<font color="#CCCCCC"> full-blown laptops and no</font>

509
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:11,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices are much more computationally</font>

510
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:15,040
capable and how do these devices you

511
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:17,470
know talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to each other and this also</font>

512
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:20,290
relates to the second second challenge

513
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:22,960
is like you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a device</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that speak</font>

514
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:25,570
speaks go up and you have you know an

515
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,240
Internet service<font color="#CCCCCC"> that speaks HTTP or</font>

516
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:30,550
HTTP so how do you how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they interact</font>

517
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,740
you probably need some kind of a proxy

518
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:35,350
or protocol translation but then how do

519
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:37,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">you still ensure end-to-end security so</font>

520
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:39,580
this is of course of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

521
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:41,530
challenge and specially not just Progo

522
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,260
translation but if you have aggregate

523
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:47,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">gators and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so on how do you still have n</font>

524
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:49,840
to n security<font color="#E5E5E5"> our software update is a</font>

525
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,210
big challenge many of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices</font>

526
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,310
don't have memory management units so if

527
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:56,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you were at the iot software update</font>

528
00:27:54,310 --> 00:28:00,100
workshop you might have read about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

529
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:04,000
and some possible ways ways to solve

530
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:06,010
them but it's it's a big challenge then

531
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,690
we got some comments from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stephan</font>

532
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:09,640
Farrell based on which we added new

533
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:12,130
challenges so one was how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you verify</font>

534
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,320
that your device IOT device that you

535
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:17,140
just bought is behaving the way it's

536
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,720
supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to behave so for any for</font>

537
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:22,390
example I go to the shop and I buy this

538
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,370
TV and bring it home internet connected

539
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:26,290
TV and bring it home how do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's</font>

540
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:28,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">not sending some data back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

541
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:29,590
manufacturer how do I know specially

542
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:37,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not sending any private</font>

543
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:40,899
information to the manufacturer exactly

544
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,910
so end of life is again a big challenge

545
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:45,700
so what happens when the manufacturer

546
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:49,570
does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist or refuses to support</font>

547
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,490
your device is it still usable can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

548
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,509
still do software updates and those kind

549
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:54,820
of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> are X</font>

550
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:57,909
tremely challenging so so how do you

551
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:00,099
handle those and can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do some pen</font>

552
00:28:57,909 --> 00:29:02,229
testing on my IOT device<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though</font>

553
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:05,439
it's it's very resource constrained how

554
00:29:02,229 --> 00:29:07,869
do i do pen testing and how do I ensure

555
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,459
quantum<font color="#CCCCCC"> resistance so if I if my IOT</font>

556
00:29:07,869 --> 00:29:12,488
device is going to be deployed<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

557
00:29:09,459 --> 00:29:14,109
wild for 20 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably there might</font>

558
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:19,389
be a quantum computer and how do I

559
00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:24,428
handle those things how am i doing on

560
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:26,799
time so then we have you know several

561
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:28,419
sections that discuss into profiles in

562
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,029
two different kind of architectural

563
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:33,419
considerations and state of the art so

564
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:35,649
like depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your application</font>

565
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:37,959
scenario are you deploying it in a home

566
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:39,728
in an enterprise or in a factory you

567
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:41,259
will have different<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirements now</font>

568
00:29:39,729 --> 00:29:43,899
you'll have different<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT</font>

569
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:45,279
devices themselves so some will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no</font>

570
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:48,998
hardware support and some will have

571
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:51,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">PPM's and some might not so so we</font>

572
00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:53,289
discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that and what kind of</font>

573
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:55,659
trade-offs you have between centralized

574
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:59,799
and distributed security architectures

575
00:29:55,659 --> 00:30:02,499
and then then we cover know some of the

576
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:04,959
ongoing<font color="#CCCCCC"> work for IOT security so for</font>

577
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:08,589
example minimal like and we had the dice

578
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:10,179
working group which specified<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS 444</font>

579
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:11,889
constrained devices and how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

580
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:15,729
lightweight IPSec so that's something

581
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:21,939
ongoing in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> El</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Vic working group so</font>

582
00:30:15,729 --> 00:30:25,659
we cover all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the draft so</font>

583
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:27,579
yeah that was kind of overview of what

584
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:29,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">the draft contains and now I come to the</font>

585
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:32,799
part what has been changed since the

586
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,449
last version so in in devotion that was

587
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,399
in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was submitted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the core</font>

588
00:30:34,449 --> 00:30:38,859
working group some years ago we had the

589
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">lifecycle the considerations state of</font>

590
00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:44,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">the art</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the challenges and</font>

591
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:48,009
and profiles but in the version that is

592
00:30:44,529 --> 00:30:50,649
now in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the research group here are some</font>

593
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:53,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">changes we may we did some cleaning some</font>

594
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:56,768
updates reordered stuff added new

595
00:30:53,949 --> 00:30:59,859
challenges that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got from seven</font>

596
00:30:56,769 --> 00:31:01,539
Farrell but also one major change was we

597
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:04,809
removed the bootstrapping so that all

598
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:06,520
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> now in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a separate document that</font>

599
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:08,379
that provides all the diff

600
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:14,440
and bootstrapping options you have for

601
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:16,750
for Internet of Things devices so here's

602
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,120
you know next<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps that we plan to do</font>

603
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:22,120
and we are open<font color="#CCCCCC"> for no comments and</font>

604
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,610
feedback I think the draft would still

605
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,620
take at least one or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two more iterations</font>

606
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:30,399
before it's it's really ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

607
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:33,459
publication so it's it's relatively long

608
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:35,530
and that's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> we as authors run into</font>

609
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:37,450
the problem how do we keep it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

610
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:39,460
it useful in and relevant information

611
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:42,220
but at the same time that it's not too

612
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:45,730
long and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually read</font>

613
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:48,250
it so we will try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to still make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

614
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:52,000
concise but also know how do we ensure

615
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:54,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's it's more smooth in terms of</font>

616
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,860
the flow so how is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it more uniform in in</font>

617
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:58,389
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of its structure and for that you</font>

618
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:01,000
know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are proposing that we have this</font>

619
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:03,340
security pillars and basically in each

620
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,120
of the section we structure it according

621
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:08,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the pillars and these pillars are</font>

622
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,600
what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of architecture you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have is it</font>

623
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:12,160
centralized or distributed what kind of

624
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,980
a device you have does it support

625
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:17,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware encryption or and does it</font>

626
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,450
support TPM where you can save keys and

627
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:22,930
so on and what kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of network and</font>

628
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:25,000
application security mechanisms and

629
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:30,370
protocols it requires and can can it

630
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:32,770
actually support them so right now we

631
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:34,689
have some threats in the thread section

632
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:36,700
but they are rather ad hoc and you can

633
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:38,710
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's written by different</font>

634
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,650
authors over time so it needs a little

635
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:43,930
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of more no work so it's it smooths</font>

636
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:45,700
but we are also thinking that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

637
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:48,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">organize the threads based on the life</font>

638
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:50,770
cycle we present<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the first section so</font>

639
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,420
what kind of threats do face face in the

640
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:54,580
bootstrapping what kind of threats do

641
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:56,140
you face in software updates and what

642
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:58,060
kind of threats do you face when you do

643
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:03,640
ownership hand over and and things like

644
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:06,190
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so for the security profiles again</font>

645
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,990
like just add a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more detail</font>

646
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:10,720
but making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document doesn't</font>

647
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:12,910
become<font color="#E5E5E5"> too long and what kind of</font>

648
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:18,010
security properties do you expect in

649
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:19,660
different application scenarios so

650
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:22,629
state-of-the-art this will still require

651
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:24,370
some work so some of the references are

652
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:27,610
out of date so they need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be updated</font>

653
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:30,909
there's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> new work going on so we</font>

654
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:34,409
need to add as much of it as we can and

655
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:37,390
include all all the new references and

656
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:39,490
the challenges so we added some new new

657
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:41,890
challenges such as you know pen testing

658
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:43,960
and and so on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

659
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:46,000
that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> follows the same structure as as</font>

660
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,710
the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the document so we just</font>

661
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,810
described the challenge and you know

662
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:52,180
here here are the potential solutions

663
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:55,840
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use to address address</font>

664
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:57,730
those challenges yeah I think that was

665
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:11,850
my last slide so I am open<font color="#CCCCCC"> to questions</font>

666
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:14,110
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback hi Maxine chance um I've</font>

667
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:17,168
gone through the stack in a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font>

668
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:20,230
over the years or similar document and

669
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:22,480
I'm kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of frustrated with a couple of</font>

670
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:25,210
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in here first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> threat</font>

671
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,850
section is all about threats to the

672
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:29,409
things not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the threat from the things</font>

673
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:32,080
and that may actually be the biggest

674
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:35,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem we have to deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the</font>

675
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:37,449
other piece of it sorry I'm a little bit

676
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:40,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">have I've had a cold for a while or</font>

677
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:46,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">something's been caused me problems um</font>

678
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:48,070
it it's now I think I'm going to stay

679
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,629
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I think it I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

680
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:53,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start thinking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet of</font>

681
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:56,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">Things not just like we thought of PCs</font>

682
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:59,890
and everything else but the fact that we

683
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:02,259
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> model of control</font>

684
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:04,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">over them with respect to what we're</font>

685
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,610
talking about here thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

686
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,770
threats from these devices is important

687
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:12,940
and probably more so than threats to the

688
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:17,259
devices I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back especially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

689
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:19,720
things like um the cyber physical

690
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:21,970
threats the denial service the

691
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,589
distributed<font color="#CCCCCC"> nyala service stuff for</font>

692
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:25,419
example how do we fix how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we keep</font>

693
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:28,570
these devices from becoming a problem

694
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:31,750
rather than the solutions we want them

695
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:33,640
to be so barn when taken but we will

696
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:36,220
what have any solutions in this document

697
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:39,069
so we can of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> note that this is an</font>

698
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:41,020
a challenge an issue we need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware</font>

699
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:43,060
of it you know physical attacks like you

700
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:45,040
pointed out those those can be added but

701
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,960
I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll go into actual</font>

702
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,690
solutions of how do you mitigate d dose

703
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,930
from IOT devices we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> give point you</font>

704
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:54,790
to tools other drafts that are that<font color="#CCCCCC"> X is</font>

705
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:56,770
right but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take a look your</font>

706
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:59,290
various profiles there are profiles that

707
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:01,860
are basically yeah it's a cheap device

708
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:05,320
no security or very little security and

709
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:07,570
because of that other piece the model

710
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:10,140
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start thinking about can we</font>

711
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:16,930
actually afford those level profiles

712
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:18,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay Dan York so I would agree with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike</font>

713
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:19,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually that threats from is an</font>

714
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting thing to consider but I was</font>

715
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,740
really more coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up here to ask a</font>

716
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,350
practical question which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just how do</font>

717
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:28,029
you want the the feedback as far as

718
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,470
email to the authors by notice you're

719
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:32,110
using github do you also want github

720
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:36,669
issues or how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work I'm new</font>

721
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:39,820
to this group so at least I as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh author</font>

722
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:41,830
is fine with github or email whichever

723
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:43,240
you prefer thank you yeah and if you

724
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:45,880

email list and also the github tracker

726
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,170
but as in general at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea we prefer</font>

727
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:52,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have discussed at the email is not</font>

get up tracker is good for the issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

729
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:59,260
just moving good quick note it may be

730
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,790
worth using as a reference or looking at

731
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:03,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">it for some of the security challenges</font>

732
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:05,529
and so on there's a paper coming out on

733
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,000
monday or tuesday from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tagged</font>

734
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:08,620
which is the broadband internet

735
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,900
technical<font color="#CCCCCC"> advisory group and one of the</font>

736
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:12,910
co-editors that goes through these

737
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,200
issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you might be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to some of</font>

738
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,970
sections that you still need and put on

739
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,980
you know sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of pull directly out of</font>

740
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:20,890
that document so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monday or Tuesday it'll</font>

741
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:22,630
be up please<font color="#E5E5E5"> send it on the list but I</font>

742
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:25,120
would also say there's a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

743
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:27,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">writing guidelines so we have the cloud</font>

744
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,859
security alliance we have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> GSMA we</font>

745
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:31,900
have the trusted computing forum there's

746
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:34,870
everyone is you know writing guidelines

747
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:36,970
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't I don't think we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

748
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:38,950
everyone happy but definitely we can

749
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:43,120
take contents from from the paper and

750
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:45,370
and hardware necessary Lee Howard can

751
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:48,970
responding to Mike's points and also you

752
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:51,460
response that yes we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be thinking</font>

753
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:54,069
about threats from but in many cases in

754
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:56,620
many ways at least we can prevent frets

755
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:58,750
threats from by preventing threats to

756
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so if we can say here's a</font>

757
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:02,890
collection of problems if you follow all

758
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,799
these security pillars then you have at

759
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:10,420
least reduced the possibility of attacks

760
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:13,600
out right die falling I'm only about

761
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:15,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">eight pages into the document you yeah</font>

762
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:19,990
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what i said i need to reduce the</font>

763
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:22,420
land neilston over<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

764
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:24,279
tremendously useful speaking to the

765
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,410
earlier points to link to the other

766
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,450
guidelines so that would at least say

767
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:30,310
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> around you can have a look at</font>

768
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:40,540
them and you can compare and they would

769
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:50,170
already be a transfuser good fine thank

770
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:52,420
you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that was a good</font>

overview of something key security work

we have at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> crew and ask our semester</font>

777
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:07,149
give a quick overview of the restful

781
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:15,430
of them but there's a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

documents for Michael Costa Rica's Clark

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mattias Kovich so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we somehow try</font>

784
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,160
to split the work in different areas

785
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,530
what we have on the area of restful

786
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,899
design we can say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had some</font>

787
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:31,870
documents were focusing on guidance some

788
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:35,260
on hypermedia language for IOT and some

789
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:36,819
work on hypermedia apps if you start for

790
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:39,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">the guidance there's all those smaller</font>

791
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,660
boxes are our drafts that we have other

working group we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a restful design</font>

overview on what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of systems you</font>

795
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:49,270
could to be designing here we had core

796
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:51,520
application descriptions which is

797
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:53,560
somewhere in<font color="#CCCCCC"> between guidance and on the</font>

798
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,650
hypermedia language couple of documents

00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:58,810
on hypermedia languages coral and HS ml

800
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:00,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">i will have more details coming</font>

801
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:02,770
the follow-up study all of these and

802
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:04,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">then also a seaborne</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> conform data that</font>

803

is closely related to the coral<font color="#E5E5E5"> color</font>

804
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:10,120
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the hypermedia applications</font>

805
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's one older document called core</font>

806
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">lining does the first document that we</font>

807
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,400
were discussing in this space but now

808
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,560
there's a brand new document called

809
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,090
tingling data hub that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably keep</font>

810
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">how every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're interested in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

811
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:23,440
topic but also this work relates to the

812
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,970
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work we are doing in the core</font>

813
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:29,440
working group so being resource

814
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:31,390
directory<font color="#CCCCCC"> box a broker etc so if you</font>

815
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,420
coat the details on the documents on the

816
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:36,370
restful design document this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the one</font>

817
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:38,860
of the doc<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants has been quite some</font>

818
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:40,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">time work in a resource group and it's</font>

819
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:43,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">really about guidance how you design</font>

820
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:46,090
these restful systems with with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iot</font>

821
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:48,279
aspects in mind so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> collection of</font>

822
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:50,080
you could say basic information

823
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,610
something you can give us a relatively

824
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,740
new person in the field<font color="#E5E5E5"> and should be</font>

825
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:55,540
able to grasp some of the key concepts

826
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:57,279
but even those who are more experts in

827
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:59,529
the field have been finding useful

828
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:03,040
things in this document and also it's a

829
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:04,360
lot of terminology so which words are we

830
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,550
using for what things is always an issue

831
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,290
in documentation and in disgust and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

832
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:10,120
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to clarify some of those</font>

833
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:13,900
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we think are important in the</font>

834
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:15,880
field but<font color="#CCCCCC"> as i said the key difference</font>

835
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,130
in this document compared other all the

836
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,200
other restful guidance out there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

837
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:21,910
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take the iot angle here</font>

838
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,830
like what is what kind of things in

839
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:26,109
specifics you to keep in mind when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

840
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:27,759
design an IOT system in the rest world

841
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:29,920
so there are we're discussing flexible

842
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,720
data formats interaction patterns and

843
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,940
other mechanisms that make it suitable

844
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,980
for situations where you want to

845
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,720
minimize the human interaction the

846
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:40,840
device is talking or things talking to

847
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:42,669
each other and then of course a lot of

848
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">our focus is on the constraint end of</font>

849
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:46,150
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> iot spectrum so how can you make</font>

850
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:47,620
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things possible in an inner</font>

851
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:50,470
constrained environment constraint

852
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:52,990
networks constraint devices and the

853
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:55,149
draft the last place in of the craft and

854
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:56,859
ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> Karsten mentioned we think that</font>

855
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:58,930
draft is getting ready for<font color="#E5E5E5"> research</font>

856
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:00,550
group a research group adoption and

857
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:02,379
there's a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issues on the</font>

858
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:05,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">kit of issue tracker which we are still</font>

859
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:07,300
planning<font color="#CCCCCC"> to address the address a set of</font>

860
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:10,170
them submit the new version and ask for

00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,170
croup adoption

862
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:16,259
then another data document on the area

863
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:18,810
of guidance is this core application

864
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:20,940
descriptions this document from Klaus

865
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:23,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hartke and the idea of the document is</font>

866
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,920
to this how you can describe<font color="#CCCCCC"> api's that</font>

867
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:29,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">are constrained restful hibernian driven</font>

868
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,750
applications so what kind of controls

869
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,310
you would have in this kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> API and</font>

870
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:34,860
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a standard way of describing</font>

871
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:36,779
them so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do an API that is using</font>

872
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:38,820
using this kind of mechanisms that they

873
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:41,130
are actually understandable for everyone

874
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:43,230
else and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also following a standard form</font>

875
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:45,300
so you have your I schemes media types

876
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:47,310
how you do link and formulation types

877
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:50,700
how you tell you set up for<font color="#CCCCCC"> names etc</font>

878
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:55,470
and that's it drug<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardcore apps if you</font>

879
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:57,509
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see details then we have this</font>

880
00:42:55,470 --> 00:43:01,560
another whole field which we call the

881
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:04,470
hypermedia language for IOT and the idea

882
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:06,029
here is that how you can express the

883
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:07,830
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> odd things you would have in a</font>

884
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:10,470
hypermedia so we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> controls links and</font>

885
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:12,540
forms etc that you can still use<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

886
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:16,080
format that is friendly<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the IOT</font>

887
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:19,770
things so as in layman terms you would

888
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:21,930
call this HTML for IOT however whereas

889
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:24,630
in HTML lot of the focuses on how you

890
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:27,419
can have structured data presented in a

891
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:29,790
generic<font color="#E5E5E5"> way this one focuses more on the</font>

892
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:33,090
control side so you help recent links

893
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:35,400
how you present forms etc and there's

894
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:37,170
also a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of related work going on at</font>

895
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">the doubletree type of things that</font>

896
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:45,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">Matthias presented earlier so you should</font>

897
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:47,220
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> check that area out so then if we</font>

898
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,629
look on bit on the details of the

899
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,970
languages<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we are working on right</font>

900
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:53,160
now so coral the constant restful up

901
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:55,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">case in language the idea there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font>

902
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:58,759
have an efficient way to represent

903
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:03,450
format forms and links in a hypermedia

904
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:05,670
so it is using<font color="#CCCCCC"> c bar which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to</font>

905
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:08,210
express<font color="#E5E5E5"> chasing by structures in a very</font>

906
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:11,340
efficient way suitable for IOT devices

907
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:12,810
it setups a host of default so you don't

908
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,790
have to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> every value every time</font>

909
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:15,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">because it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has a sensible default values</font>

910
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:19,140
for a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you will be working</font>

911
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,760
on instead of string<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs it's using</font>

912
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,810
numeric IDs which are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> general more</font>

913
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,570
efficient in these kind of environments

914
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:26,520
and overall thanks all

915
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:28,680
mechanisms often it's only a few bites

916
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,650
that you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be exchanging in the</font>

917
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:34,350
interactions with the hypermedia and

918
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:35,810
also even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though focus is on is on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

919
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:37,830
controls you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also embed</font>

920
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:40,200
representations in some of some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

921
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:41,880
messages in that in that way to reduce

922
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,859
the mud roundtree to do so instead of

923
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,240
just always having to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow a link you</font>

924
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:48,570
can also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the link link</font>

925
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,979
representation in band and the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

926
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:51,420
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to have this in a simple</font>

927
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,340
implementation some Taylor class one

928
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,080
device<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only small amount of RAM and</font>

929
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,960
flash and still be able to interact in a

930
00:44:55,080 --> 00:45:00,299
full hypermedia way so there's two

931
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:05,580
different drafts that are all related on

932
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:09,300
this topic and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have HS ml is</font>

933
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:11,549
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a micro coaster so here the idea is</font>

934
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:13,500
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a combined cording format and</font>

937
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,720
JSON and see board for the

938
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,750
representation so it has a lot of

939
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,220
similarities with for the coral however

940
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,990
the key thing here is use link

941
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:27,390
annotations for describing the

942
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:30,629
application semantics and there you have

943
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:34,859
the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> coaster in archaea at HS ml</font>

944
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:36,840
for reference so at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this that you may</font>

945
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:38,700
wonder why do we have two<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

946
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,500
documents well one thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> coffee</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

947
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">research group we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exploring what is</font>

948
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,220
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good way of doing things we have been</font>

949
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,230
thinking comparing these two different

950
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:48,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">approaches and what are similarities and</font>

951
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:51,060
what are the commonalities they're so

952
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,100
similar things here both use collections

953
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:55,440
of links and items so they follow a

954
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:58,470
similar pattern there they use<font color="#E5E5E5"> hyper</font>

955
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:01,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">media controls to perform research state</font>

956
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:04,319
updates they have interval data models

957
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:06,480
as its custom in here and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

958
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,430
as Michael pointed out HTML can even be

959
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,500
encoded as coral so they have a lot of

960
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:12,600
commonalities but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> few</font>

961
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:15,360
differences to which we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

962
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,650
into for example coral the data model is

963
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,540
derived from hell the hypermedia

964
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:21,150
application language whereas as

965
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:23,130
mentioned HS ml is more on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cording</font>

966
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:24,630
format and send email and exploring how

967
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:28,530
those together can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used in an</font>

968
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:31,590
efficient way also Cora used media<font color="#E5E5E5"> types</font>

969
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:34,890
heavily and<font color="#E5E5E5"> with HH HTML is focusing on</font>

970
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:36,270
link annotations so those are

971
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:37,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">similarities and differences between</font>

972
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:41,670
those two documents and what

973
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,799
right now ongoing<font color="#CCCCCC"> work is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that figuring</font>

974
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:45,690
out what what what situation what kind

975
00:46:43,799 --> 00:46:47,220
of mechanisms makes make sense in what

976
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:49,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of environments so that's</font>

977
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,569
experimentation on use cases and

978
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:53,819
implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> tis and the idea is</font>

979
00:46:51,569 --> 00:46:55,589
eventually to converge to a single

980
00:46:53,819 --> 00:47:01,650
solution but right now we are exploring

981
00:46:55,589 --> 00:47:05,520
both of these tracks and then the whole

982
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:06,780
area<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hypermedia applications so what</font>

983
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,569
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things we can actually build on</font>

984
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:11,369
the tools that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our toolbox</font>

scenario in that context that graph is

991
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:28,710
currently expired because it other other

992
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:30,480
graphs have newer material but there is

993
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:31,589
maybe a plan to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let it all update that</font>

994
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,859
using the latest things for example

995
00:47:31,589 --> 00:47:36,660
coral however<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a a brand new</font>

tingling data hub and the tingling data

998
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:44,579
hub is really a a restful hypermedia

for storing and publishing information

1001
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:52,319
on a central location so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a lot of</font>

1002
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,480
similarities with a resource directory

with<font color="#CCCCCC"> pub/sub broker with the old mirror</font>

1004

server etc trying to generalize these

1005
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:00,630
concepts and look at them at in a bigger

1006

00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,650
the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> functionality of course you</font>

00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:21,900
supported by coop and it also supports

1014
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:23,730
simple search<font color="#CCCCCC"> source Curie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> semantic so</font>

1015
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:26,400
you can be you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can find work out things</font>

1016
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:28,440
today the hubby storing but the key

1017
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,780
thing in the kings of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data hub is</font>

1018
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,000
this evolvable<font color="#CCCCCC"> API based on hypermedia</font>

1019
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,920
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> where a lot of the work we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have been</font>

1020
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,220
doing it a core working group so far has

1021
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:40,770
relatively static API defined by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URI</font>

1022
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:42,180
templates so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't have a one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> URI</font>

1023
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:44,700
where you post<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then maybe you</font>

1024
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:47,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">discover links etc but this is aiming to</font>

1025
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:48,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">be the really fully restful way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

1026
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:50,799
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> proper hypermedia controls to</font>

1027
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:56,020
achieve achieve same things

1028
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:58,810
and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft on that one so</font>

1029
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:02,230
that was an overview rather quick

1030
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:03,790
overview because we are low on time so

1031
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:05,050
it's a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of documents in a</font>

1032
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:07,720
pretty interesting area on the

1033
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:09,490
hypermedia application so please read

1034
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:12,310
the documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

1035
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:13,810
on one of those any of those sent sent

1036
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:16,990
review comments on the on the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1037
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:19,870
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> authors</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and hope you guys are able</font>

1038
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:27,609
to participate in to work any questions

1039
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:38,470
comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess we can have</font>

1040
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:40,150
last one I'm actually surprised how you

1041
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:46,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">managed to present all this information</font>

1042
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:50,560
in time I was sorry thinking okay yeah

1043
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:52,209
so um today I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whore on my name is</font>

1044
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">Alexandra</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pelf and I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1045
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:56,230
talking to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you about the thing that is a</font>

1046
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,270
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fringe between the</font>

1047
00:49:56,230 --> 00:50:02,320
research and the reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will be</font>

1048
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:05,259
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming so I imagine that most of</font>

1049
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:07,300
you know what co-op is and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT part</font>

1050
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:08,920
of the the world and I would like just

1051
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:15,610
to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of hands how many of you</font>

1052
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:17,440
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what yang is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah so most of</font>

1053
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:21,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the people know what yang is also so it</font>

1054
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:25,630
will be also an easy so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I maybe</font>

1055
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:27,610
they they<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that so first a couple</font>

1056
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:30,220
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> tanks and I will breathe because I</font>

1057
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:31,780
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like 30 slides so you'll</font>

1058
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:34,149
see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of slides actually not being</font>

1059
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:35,980
shown for very long a big thanks to the

1060
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:39,130
chairs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> too many many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1061
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:41,020
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually with whom we have had</font>

1062
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:44,050
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of discussions about all these</font>

1063
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:45,580
restful a way of making applications and

1064
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:49,240
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually gave a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ideas</font>

1065
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:52,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that led led us to think about this</font>

1066
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:54,430
small little picture there which nice

1067
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,820
colors but maybe not that readable is

1068
00:50:54,430 --> 00:51:01,629
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have here today so maybe some of</font>

1069
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:04,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have heard about comma 0 or not so</font>

1070
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:07,480
come I is the net comb for the

1071
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:11,530
rest conf for<font color="#E5E5E5"> EIU t so we bring the</font>

1072
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:13,810
young world to IOT and what we see today

1073
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:15,850
is that you have this huge part of the

1074
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:17,560
young community here that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

1075
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:20,950
doing for others<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for big stuff and</font>

1076
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:23,650
the IOT is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very small compared</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1077
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:25,960
this so first thing that I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1078
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:27,730
send us a<font color="#E5E5E5"> message for you is that in</font>

1079
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:31,360
reality we think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> things will look</font>

1080
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:33,340
more like this in the future because you

1081
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,130
know the modules of young that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see</font>

1082
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:37,480
well you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have like</font>

1083
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:41,490
billions of types of routers out there

1084
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:44,200
but we will have billions of devices so

1085
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:47,589
right now we can we say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ok jung can</font>

1086
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:50,649
serve all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> area and actually in fact</font>

1087
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:52,570
we say yeah so young will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be everywhere</font>

1088
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:54,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">well of course there will be some parts</font>

1089
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:56,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">that will be non</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> completely young it</font>

1090
00:51:54,580 --> 00:52:00,759
will be very very small of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course but</font>

1091
00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:03,760
this is may be completely restful view

1092
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:06,610
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so I hope I got your</font>

1093
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">attention and what where I'm going to be</font>

1094
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:11,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about here is an interaction</font>

1095
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:13,720
model for making IOT applications and

1096
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:16,090
for managing energy devices with young

1097
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:17,980
so what I'm not going to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is</font>

1098
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:19,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">how we are going to replace all the</font>

1099
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:22,510
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been that we were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

1100
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,980
in in core and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

1101
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:26,830
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how we are going to be</font>

1102
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:28,180
replacing the things that re was talking

1103
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:30,640
about you know how you do the web

1104
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:33,370
linking how you do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gateways how to</font>

1105
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,900
you how we do restful pops up and all

1106
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:37,930
that stuff so these are things that

1107
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:39,610
remain completely valid and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

1108
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:41,890
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be talking</font>

1109
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:43,810
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you replace</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the semantics and</font>

1110
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:46,690
things like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1111
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:48,640
talking to be talking is that this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1112
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:50,590
way that actually allows you to do to

1113
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:53,230
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a much richer way of communicating</font>

1114
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:55,900
of communication and interaction between

1115
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:58,230
the devices you either in a thing to

1116
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:04,630
think fashion or from a centralized to

1117
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:06,600
thing or I think the device so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1118
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:08,800
have a good definition of what an

1119
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:11,980
interaction actually is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

1120
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:14,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">not an easy thing to find out and I will</font>

1121
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:15,610
leave you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read you know we can get</font>

1122
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:17,950
all the slides from from the

1123
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:20,470
presentation

1124
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:21,819
what is what what's not an interaction

1125
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:24,490
well when you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like different things</font>

1126
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:28,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking dif different languages having</font>

1127
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:33,939
different representations of the of the

1128
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:35,710
data so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an interaction model</font>

1129
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:37,570
description for example in a restful

1130
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:39,700
application well you have links you

1131
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:41,680
follow the links then in these links you

1132
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:43,629
get some content formats and then you

1133
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,848
find out how to submit some forms and

1134
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:47,589
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you go from</font>

1135
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:49,210
one device or from one resource to

1136
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:52,480
another and this is how you interact

1137
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:54,880
with this end device so now what and

1138
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:58,060
this is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example so you have like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1139
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:00,430
simple request that says put and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1140
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:02,740
have some resource and on this resource

1141
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:05,259
you have some data representation and

1142
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:07,720
the value 25 so you put some temperature

1143
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:11,260
there and then you have some answers

1144
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:13,720
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that I updated the I updated</font>

1145
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:16,150
is for you so you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like a</font>

1146
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:18,098
method the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URI that you're in the syntax</font>

1147
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:20,770
and the data variables so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

1148
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:22,780
is how you actually know so this answers

1149
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:24,670
a lot of questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how that you</font>

1150
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:27,460
actually interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this device and</font>

1151
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:28,780
this is actually provides you with with

1152
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:31,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">the semantics of what you are doing</font>

1153
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:33,880
there so now the big question is how do

1154
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:36,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know so how does the desert the</font>

1155
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:38,950
client how does this the client knows

1156
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:42,040
that here actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud must send</font>

1157
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:43,990
25 so that this is a temperature<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

1158
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:45,910
in degrees you know you went through<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1159
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:47,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">the parts you you found that there is a</font>

1160
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:49,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">you right and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you found that you can do</font>

1161
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,819
it put on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and then you can you can</font>

1162
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:54,609
learn you know cake out why not why not

1163
00:54:51,819 --> 00:54:56,710
just put like a string what so<font color="#CCCCCC"> how would</font>

1164
00:54:54,609 --> 00:55:01,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">can indicate me what I can do with this</font>

1165
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:04,599
link or how can I know that for example

1166
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:07,210
of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very huge value a very huge integer</font>

1167
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:09,430
is not a valid thing to do well of

1168
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:11,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">course when you do restful api</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ice you</font>

1169
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:13,180
have this and you have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in coral you</font>

1170
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:14,740
have this in the other thing that I

1171
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:18,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">forgot how what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the name is you have</font>

1172
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:20,770
a waiting to get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> information and um</font>

1173
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:24,550
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ways is for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example you have</font>

1174
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:27,339
like content type here that will say

1175
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:29,349
that will indicate you well this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1176
00:55:27,339 --> 00:55:30,880
type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> content which you can give to</font>

1177
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:31,450
this resource in which you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1178
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,070
forget from

1179
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:37,450
resource and this way we will interact

1180
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:40,600
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so let me present you with</font>

1181
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:43,509
another with another alternative to this

1182
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:45,700
so of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can go you can use your</font>

1183
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:47,110
restful api so you can use your restful

1184
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:49,299
way to finding all links in all

1185
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:51,100
resources and then at some point you

1186
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:55,270
stumble other thing that is marked as

1187
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:59,500
being calm I or as being young so when

1188
00:55:55,270 --> 00:56:02,980
you do this so you discover it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when</font>

1189
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:05,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do this you can actually send a much</font>

1190
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:07,600
richer set of interaction you can have a

1191
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:10,750
much richer set of interaction with this

1192
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:12,640
entry point the thing that is really

1193
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:16,750
important here is that young actually

1194
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:19,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">defines has a way to defining schema so</font>

1195
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:21,160
you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the model of interaction</font>

1196
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:23,470
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this Buddhist point so you can now</font>

1197
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:25,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay there I have under this point I</font>

1198
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:29,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a temperature and this temperature</font>

1199
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:32,800
is expressed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Celsion and this cell</font>

1200
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:36,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">sium can be from 0 to 200 degrees</font>

1201
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:38,350
Celsius so you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> your restroom engine</font>

1202
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:40,330
to get to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point and then you know</font>

1203
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:41,920
how to interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1204
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:44,110
you can have temperature humidity or

1205
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,610
something else you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some values</font>

1206
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:47,260
you know some values that can be read

1207
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:50,980
only and so forth so all these things

1208
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:53,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already there and they're well</font>

1209
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:55,330
understood by most more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> half of you</font>

1210
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:56,650
now in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> indie in this room so you</font>

1211
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:59,170
know about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the young you know how to</font>

1212
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:03,520
describe this interaction so basically

1213
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:05,050
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes like a medium term solution</font>

1214
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,830
that gives actually quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of power</font>

1215
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:09,730
you know between the fully restful

1216
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:11,500
application where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the haters</font>

1217
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,970
and when you go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you discover all the</font>

1218
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:15,700
things and you need to understand them

1219
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:18,160
here you have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> this thing that are</font>

1220
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:20,169
already there and we have the protocol

1221
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,899
that is there so come by the protocol

1222
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:25,120
which is under discussion a lot in in

1223
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:26,620
the core working group and we have all

1224
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:31,690
these mappings that order to do this

1225
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:34,810
actually quite efficiently so uh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

1226
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:38,320
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was the last slide and I</font>

1227
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:40,930
flipped over with this I would like to

1228
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:42,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">submit to you that you know we have the</font>

1229
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:45,160
restful way that is like that in the

1230
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:47,259
haters way that is like the

1231
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:51,279
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term ideal vision of the world</font>

1232
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:53,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we have the same thing minus one</font>

1233
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,720
that is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit much much closer</font>

1234
00:57:53,319 --> 00:57:58,058
and which can give you a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1235
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,890
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually good that we</font>

1236
00:57:58,059 --> 00:58:03,250
care about how we do how we build

1237
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:04,868
applications in a much in a specific and

1238
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:10,170
concrete way that work<font color="#E5E5E5"> today and that</font>

1239
00:58:04,869 --> 00:58:17,079
can scale for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> iot thanks thank you so</font>

1240
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:19,809
whose heads are spinning no nobody's had

1241
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:22,270
this funny 35 whose whose heads are

1242
00:58:19,809 --> 00:58:27,130
spinning in a comfortable way I mean who

1243
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:31,839
liked what they saw in the last hour

1244
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:35,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">here nobody liked what they saw who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font>

1245
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:38,078
not like what they saw would not come to

1246
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:41,049
another meeting of this group<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay can't</font>
