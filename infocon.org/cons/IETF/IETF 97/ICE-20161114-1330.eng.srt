00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:55,300
out of it so based diverse a pull

120
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:59,060
request created and it was merged and

agreement that we came to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going</font>

of all the the default<font color="#CCCCCC"> value is 50</font>

136
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,939
milliseconds and but you may use another

00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:45,540
value based on whatever Network

make sure that you take all those into

144
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:05,790
consideration when you calculate ETA

145
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,470
values you're not gonna have many of

146
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,290
them with the same low value which is

147
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,870
gonna cause problem so they so-called

148
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,730
global ta value and then in addition

149
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,440
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some text explaining why this</font>

150
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:20,250
new minimum value of<font color="#CCCCCC"> five milliseconds</font>

151
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">which I see there now is misspelled up</font>

152
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,120
there maybe it's also in the draft I

153
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to check</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that because i copy pasted</font>

154
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,630
to the text but anyway i'll check that

155
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,729
but anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are some text</font>

156
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,640
explaining why for our for in this case

157
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:35,490
5 millisecond was<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but for transport</font>

158
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,460
protocols in general it's it's it's it's

159
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:42,870
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so but you can read that in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

160
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:51,180
draft I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it here and that was</font>

161
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:54,360
it ok so for everyone this has been the

162
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">V open issue since well pre Muslim that</font>

163
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">as long as we be doing ice in the ice</font>

164
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:00,450
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group so are we now all happy</font>

165
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the final conclusion five</font>

166
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:06,930
milliseconds seems to be safe also

167
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:10,740
regarding our transport folks you know

168
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:12,689
radius it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I don't have this</font>

169
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:17,820
section number dave i think it's 11 to

<font color="#CCCCCC">your son but you'll find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it yes so are</font>

171
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:24,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">we happy now any final concerns or we're</font>

172
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:26,160
gonna go<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward with this is I would be</font>

173
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,449
more than happy to go forward but just

174
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,780
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure we don't get any</font>

175
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,780
surprises

176
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay i think it was mainly cullen who</font>

177
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,880
who had issues with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> but as far as I</font>

178
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:42,329
understand he's happy with it so yeah I

179
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">think so hi I'm Paul Eric I think I'm</font>

180
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:48,960
happy with it did some simple tests with

181
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:52,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheapest mats I could buy from home</font>

182
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:56,940
depot<font color="#CCCCCC"> I felt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to crush</font>

183
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:59,160
them with anything yeah I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

184
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:04,940
whatever older equipment would struggle

185
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,939
but anyone seems up to speed with this

186
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:16,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we are so far so good with</font>

187
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:16,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">TA I see some noting in the room</font>

188
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:38,730
excellent that was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was quick and</font>

189
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:40,590
easy so polaric so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font>

190
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:43,440
initial thoughts on what we could do

191
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:47,940
next when trickle<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes and whatnot is</font>

192
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:50,880
finished<font color="#CCCCCC"> so one of the things I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

193
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at is moving from this static</font>

194
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:58,500
concept we have with us today to more

195
00:11:53,070 --> 00:12:02,520
dynamic changing media pass so the

196
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:05,430
options we have today by influencing the

197
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:09,420
network is RSVP which is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

198
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:11,760
dead in the water doesn't really work we

199
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,579
have ecn today to get some feedback from

200
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,860
the network at least but at least for

201
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,290
UDP<font color="#CCCCCC"> test</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its own problems we're not sure</font>

202
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:26,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever the network would mark UDP</font>

203
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:30,240
packets right and DCP seems to have its

204
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:33,329
own set of issues but at least in the

205
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,220
confined realms of the network it we're

206
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:39,390
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work it actually seems to</font>

207
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:43,470
work so that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing if you look</font>

208
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:45,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the client options you can rate adapt</font>

209
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:49,630
which most clients hopefully

210
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,880
and you have ice where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can check the</font>

211
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:54,189
connectivity of all available past like

212
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,850
all the physical ones and various ports

213
00:12:54,190 --> 00:13:01,420
and protocols we recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> had some</font>

214
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:03,640
issues by choosing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> port for</font>

215
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:07,300
sending media more explicitly the

216
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:09,400
traceroute port<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3343 which seems to be</font>

217
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,689
heavily<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate limited in some ice peace</font>

218
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:15,010
and not others so took<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while before we</font>

219
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:19,320
actually managed to figure out it was

220
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:19,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually that port that causes problems</font>

221
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:27,730
so the end goal is to find a combination

222
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:30,460
of all physical and virtual network past

223
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:33,040
life I've before at physics and the

224
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,840
transport protocol you'd be teased btls

225
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,329
and ports that actually have

226
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,070
connectivity and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

227
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:44,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">choose the best one not based on</font>

228
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:46,570
priority but on actual measurements so

229
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:49,720
what building blocks do we have well we

230
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:52,000
have multiple RTP which can set up

231
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,870
multiple paths I'm not sure whatever you

232
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:04,300
can have TCP and UDP multiple RTP

233
00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:14,110
anybody knows yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only for you to</font>

234
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:15,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">view but that's fixable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

235
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,560
have I swear you check all the

236
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,410
connectivity stuff and then you choose

237
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,989
you build a valid list and then you

238
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:25,540
choose one candidate pair for

239
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:29,260
communication so like combining those

240
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:33,339
two might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a good idea because like</font>

241
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:34,870
and then you could build and I set up

242
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:38,350
and you can just switch between pulse

243
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:47,080
without restarting<font color="#CCCCCC"> eyes now looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

244
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:49,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">Lee Sora maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like if you could kind of</font>

245
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,590
give take the valid list and have more

246
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:54,910
than one nomination I guess you could

247
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:58,060
kind of use that with your photography

248
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,290
oh yeah just likes I'm first answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

249
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,229
I mean yeah there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff</font>

250
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:03,730
RTP that sort of implicitly you know

251
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,579
assumes a single path like all the feed

252
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:09,370
there's only a single feedback / eyes

253
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:12,008
perspective it's kind of an assumption

254
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:13,649
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to converge on one the</font>

255
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:15,880
other thing I would put a sort of as the

256
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:18,279
possible thing in the building blocks is

257
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,079
that given that we're doing sctp for

258
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:22,120
deep for all the data channel stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

259
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">think an sctp does multipath but I</font>

260
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,310
would've thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's using it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

261
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:28,120
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing to put into your</font>

262
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:33,670
building blocks bucket that's true maybe

263
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:35,740
quick whatever Oh create nice

264
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:38,170
transitions no need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to switch media</font>

265
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,709
addresses if I detects a better path and

266
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:43,630
stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and why I am looking</font>

267
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:47,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">at UDP and tcp it's always interesting</font>

268
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:52,389
to see how is P sometimes rate limited

269
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:55,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">red team at UDP so like if this is the</font>

270
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:57,490
UDP traffic through<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nice V sometimes</font>

271
00:15:55,209 --> 00:16:01,739
when they have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DOS attack they start</font>

272
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:05,290
to cut traffic and obviously your ice

273
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:07,600
session which suffer and maybe gets even

274
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:10,839
worse when quick gets deployed I don't

275
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,170
know that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just an assumption so being</font>

276
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:16,480
able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> frys to switch between UDP and</font>

277
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:23,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">tcp and stuff like that might also be a</font>

278
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:28,930
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea and why yeah sure in</font>

279
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:31,000
purchasing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I'm coming back</font>

280
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,199
crystal I'm coming back to my real

281
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">equation and this is something actually</font>

282
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:39,670
we did we've had some discussions when

283
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:42,699
we did the sctp over<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS draft we</font>

284
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,439
discussed the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've discussed</font>

285
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:47,889
the same thing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the BF CP people</font>

286
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:50,500
with their eyes consideration and for

287
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:55,829
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think in</font>

288
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:59,079
a music when we talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ice the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SDP</font>

289
00:16:55,829 --> 00:17:00,839
about switching a candidate because my

290
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:04,030
understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can have</font>

291
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:07,270
multiple connections whether you re to

292
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:09,250
always renominate them but you can have

293
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:12,490
them any use in if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're using for</font>

294
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:15,040
example consists continues this

295
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,410
freshness you're gonna you know keep

296
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,389
them all alive using that one but then

297
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:21,220
one of the things we say for example is

298
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,530
that or we assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can switch from</font>

299
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:27,699
one to another because what we are going

300
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:30,428
to suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> added text is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

301
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:33,100
you switch from UDP to tcp or from<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp</font>

302
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:35,679
to UDP that you don't need to send an

303
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,990
updated offer you can just do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

304
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,700
if you have those candidate pairs in the

305
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:43,900
valid list you can just switch between

306
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:53,080
them today already there is nothing new

307
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:56,350
needed for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well you still need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

308
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:59,110
kind of keep the valley list valid and

309
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:02,290
stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peter thatcher</font>

310
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:04,080
google so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it at some point you're</font>

311
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,909
probably gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a slide that says</font>

312
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,428
what do people think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it was that the</font>

313
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:13,390
last slider this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one okays that is that</font>

314
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:17,500
now or yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it seems like</font>

315
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:19,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have but there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two ideas inside</font>

316
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,710
of this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that the ice agent would</font>

317
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:25,240
keep multiple candidate pairs alive and

318
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:29,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a good idea that's</font>

319
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:31,360
similar to what I was proposing with the

320
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">Reno mination draft and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then the other</font>

321
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,928
is that you would not only keep them

322
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:39,309
alive but you would actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> send media</font>

323
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:42,070
on more than one at a time and if like

324
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:44,889
you're suggesting you're going to do any

325
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:47,678
form of old multipath either multipath

326
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:49,900
RTP or multipath quick multipath sctp on

327
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,740
top of ice then ice would have to have a

328
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:59,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">way of allowing multiple network pass to</font>

329
00:18:53,740 --> 00:19:01,240
send media at the same time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

330
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:03,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">the question would be like Chris Torres</font>

331
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,050
saying is is there anything we need to

332
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:07,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">add ice to actually make that possible</font>

333
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:10,659
or is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of baked in</font>

334
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,550
and I don't know I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really think of</font>

335
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:19,270
anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you any reason you can't</font>

336
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:21,790
do this already because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you can</font>

337
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:23,050
already keep multiple paths alive I you

338
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,809
just need a way to renominate which was

339
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,290
what I proposed but I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need a</font>

340
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:28,530
multi

341
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:31,330
the path renomination maybe but I don't

342
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:34,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah nominating more than one candidate</font>

343
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:39,610
Paris probably what's missing but that's

344
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:42,280
not huge right your God and you sounded

345
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:47,679
a bit so I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with Peter and with</font>

346
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:50,980
crystal and you sounded a bit like it

347
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:53,830
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a job of ice to make decisions</font>

348
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:56,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">on which ones to pick or how to monitor</font>

349
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:58,449
and then that that I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be super</font>

350
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,340
happy with so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's up to the</font>

351
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,380
transport that runs on top of ice to

352
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,669
figure out which of the path you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

353
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,440
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know an interesting questions</font>

354
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:08,140
whether there's any kind of sensible API

355
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,170
one would<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do to come up with an</font>

356
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:13,260
order to allow path changes upcoming

357
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:19,330
things and so forth to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be then also</font>

358
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:23,440
conveyed yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree nice if ice</font>

359
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:25,570
presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ollie it's like so here I</font>

360
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,120
tried these 20 and here's the three that

361
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:30,970
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and oh by the way to have come</font>

362
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,340
up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> one has disappeared and but that</font>

363
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:35,140
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> booing in the sense of saying</font>

364
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,840
it works or doesn't work it shouldn't be

365
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,730
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of quality assumption on how</font>

366
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">how well that would work I think that's</font>

367
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:46,000
something you would want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have layer</font>

368
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:48,670
above yeah angry and that's a problem we

369
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,190
have it ice today is it's the priority

370
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:54,130
of the candidates<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because it</font>

371
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:56,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">says how to create a checklist and how</font>

372
00:20:54,130 --> 00:21:00,070
to do the checks and it also tells you

373
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:02,020
what to page sort of I thought the

374
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:04,000
project was only for ordering but the

375
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,500
main it gives you suggestions but<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you</font>

376
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,660
will achieve yeah you would give

377
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,670
multiple then the app could still figure

378
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,040
out what the priorities would want to

379
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:14,340
use but I agree it's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

380
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:19,000
application to choose which path and

381
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:22,110
it's maybe Isis job to just present a

382
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,610
list of<font color="#CCCCCC"> off the paths I don't know a</font>

383
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:27,909
gentleman I sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of respond to Peter um</font>

384
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:30,250
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you know in terms of do we have</font>

385
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mechanisms with ice bus renomination</font>

386
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,760
to do this probably but i think you

387
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">still need negotiations that yes this</font>

388
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,540
really is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing as opposed to</font>

389
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,890
I'm doing ice busty nomination but only

390
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,309
expect immediate a single connection at

391
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,889
a time

392
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:43,299
I'm um and then I think there's probably

393
00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:45,639
gonna be a lot need to be a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

394
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:48,070
at you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you know i'm not</font>

395
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:49,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure like multipath RTP is fully baked</font>

396
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,408
as we would like so probably need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

397
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:58,450
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at that level but that's</font>

398
00:21:50,409 --> 00:22:00,610
not this working groups problem so I

399
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:03,159
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question is is that something</font>

400
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:05,649
we should care about making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> space</font>

401
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:08,889
works with or is this something we

402
00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:16,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">should wait until I space is finished</font>

403
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:18,580
and then Kirsten off thinking I don't

404
00:22:16,389 --> 00:22:20,168
remember now what ice be say so maybe I

405
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,809
space says that you must speak one but

406
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:26,289
but this was more something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

407
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:28,539
for for the ice sip work but of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

408
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:30,369
if it's not allowed in ice<font color="#E5E5E5"> beasts to</font>

409
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:36,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">begin with then we don't need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to worry</font>

410
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:37,619
about it in a music either um Jonathan a

411
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:40,330
clear my mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish would be to say</font>

412
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:41,860
don't keep shoveling new features in

413
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,629
dice this let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get ice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> base done with</font>

414
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,369
the existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> feature set and this will</font>

415
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:48,668
be an exception it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really I think</font>

416
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:51,970
our extension story is pretty solid<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font>

417
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:53,799
think let's not put this as you know

418
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:56,019
don't go keep adding features to an

419
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:57,190
existing release you know release and

420
00:22:56,019 --> 00:23:08,590
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know release the next thing</font>

421
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:12,100
later so if anybody has any ideas please

422
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:15,580
come and talk to us and maybe write up a

423
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:20,709
draft or anything like like that instead

424
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:22,480
of just having a presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank</font>

425
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:25,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">you Paul Eric so I'm this whole</font>

426
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,360
discussion does relate to the next point

427
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:30,940
we have on the agenda it's like um what

428
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:34,029
we want to do in the future will be the

429
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:36,820
ice working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group um is it something</font>

430
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:39,929
something along these lines or something

431
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:43,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">something else we want to call it a day</font>

432
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:49,809
so if there are no more<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments on this</font>

433
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:53,159
topic um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Paul you wanna you already</font>

434
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:53,158
address these points yeah

435
00:23:54,259 --> 00:24:15,360
you know all right there are two paths

436
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:17,179
on the road which one shall we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take you</font>

437
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,269
get to choose which one goes with which

438
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:25,320
picture or<font color="#E5E5E5"> road in the picture so two</font>

439
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:29,850
options we have are a we continue

440
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:31,918
working on extensions dice our<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

441
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:38,809
charter currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> said without major</font>

442
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:43,110
changes or<font color="#E5E5E5"> B we say ice is done and</font>

443
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:44,850
anything that we would want to do in the

444
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,769
future would involve major changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

445
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:52,969
so we would need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least do a</font>

446
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:52,970
recharter those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two roads</font>

447
00:24:53,629 --> 00:25:11,820
discuss uh John flex I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you</font>

448
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:14,129
know favor major changes just like for

449
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,960
the sake of major changes i mean i would

450
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:18,119
want to see you know an individual's

451
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,559
mission proposal for this is how we

452
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,668
think i should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely rewritten</font>

453
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,139
and i guess there have been some in the

454
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:23,159
past but i'm not sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much people</font>

455
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:26,158
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> my things they've done so far</font>

456
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:27,600
still and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I mean I'm</font>

457
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,419
open to it if somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> says here's my</font>

458
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">new design lets you know given our</font>

459
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:34,830
experience we do it from scratch but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

460
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,908
not so going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say sure I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

461
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:47,249
what they are they're just long as their

462
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:51,929
major changes so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

463
00:25:47,249 --> 00:25:54,629
given<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little context it wasn't Berlin</font>

464
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:58,559
it was the one before that I proposed a

465
00:25:54,629 --> 00:26:00,389
few minor changes and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

466
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,950
the microphone said yeah this is nice

467
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:04,158
but what we really need are some major

468
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,159
changes

469
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:14,730
we could go check<font color="#E5E5E5"> the minutes but it was</font>

470
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:16,560
it was kind of 5050 at the mic it was

471
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:20,340
like people in favor of minor people in

472
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:27,540
favor of major so that's still the

473
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:29,250
decision we have oops is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux the only</font>

474
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:39,420
one with an opinion because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if so we'll</font>

475
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:43,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">just let him decide Ted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Hardy I kind of</font>

476
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:46,650
agree with Jonathan um putting a a

477
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:48,780
charter in front of the ITF community

478
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:50,760
that says we're going to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to</font>

479
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:52,649
say make ice more flexible robust and

480
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,050
more suitable for changing environments

481
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,850
and allow major changes you then<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

482
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:59,340
have some milestones that listed what

483
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,929
those major changes were and what they

484
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:04,649
were going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the community and</font>

485
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:06,660
so in the absence of a concrete proposal

486
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,070
that would fit into that kind of

487
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,470
structure of giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new milestone</font>

488
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,600
shoot for I would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> you you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep the</font>

489
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:15,240
current<font color="#CCCCCC"> charter continue to make the</font>

490
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:19,409
incremental improvements that are in

491
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:22,650
mind for right now and then if somebody

492
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:25,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes forward with a proposal that you</font>

493
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:27,480
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take up and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> consensus is</font>

494
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:30,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's a major change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you recharter</font>

495
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,130
at that point with that is the milestone

496
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:35,370
associated with it rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than making</font>

497
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:37,590
this general adjustment okay so let me

498
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:39,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I understood correctly the right</font>

499
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:43,350
ITF process in this situation is to

500
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:46,200
propose something outside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter in</font>

501
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:49,050
this group but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be like a</font>

502
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,760
possible topic of recharter when we say

503
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:53,580
okay this is something specific we can't

504
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,620
do here<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we would right now but we</font>

505
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,720
would reach<font color="#CCCCCC"> arter but we do it here so</font>

506
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,760
Ted<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hardy there's always more than one</font>

507
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,110
way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it within the ITF process and</font>

508
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,820
you could take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to dispatch and</font>

509
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,990
dispatch could tell you to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> over here</font>

510
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,070
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's already a working group</font>

511
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,900
or you could do a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of other</font>

512
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:08,879
things but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly works within</font>

513
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:11,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF process as I understand it and</font>

514
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,980
so that that is a way to do it that

515
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:16,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly well understood okay let's</font>

516
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,700
good feedback thanks

517
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:28,140
sorry my<font color="#CCCCCC"> comas resolved basically plus</font>

518
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:32,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">one at this point ok so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we have</font>

519
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:35,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">come up with option C which is proposed</font>

520
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,890
stuff here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up as</font>

521
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:39,719
proposals yeah I'm drop that sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

522
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:41,940
maybe you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> phrase that a little more</font>

523
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,440
positively<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think previously we've been</font>

524
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,030
focusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on getting ice bitch mated</font>

525
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,470
things done so we've sort of been saying

526
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:48,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that are not directly than</font>

527
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,970
charter you know sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of getting a lot</font>

528
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:53,309
of time I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're now moving towards</font>

529
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:55,710
lets you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know give meeting time and less</font>

530
00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:58,710
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to new innovative work so we can</font>

531
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:01,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">discuss it right and more specifically</font>

532
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:04,559
if we don't get any concrete proposals

533
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:07,649
we won't be sending any agenda time and

534
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:10,799
there won't be a meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ben Campbell</font>

535
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:12,360
and thought I'll preface this with I'm

536
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,540
saying this without really knowing what

537
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:18,059
the concrete proposals are likely to be

538
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:19,950
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was just mentioned you know we</font>

539
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:21,600
have both the ability to bring things

540
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:23,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">here to the working group or to take</font>

541
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,730
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dispatch what I would suggest</font>

542
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,770
is if these are things that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

543
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:31,200
self-contained and ice it makes perfect

544
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:32,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense to do it here but ice is a</font>

545
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,669
protocol that's used by a bunch of other

546
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,139
stuff and if we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about things</font>

547
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:39,150
that have<font color="#CCCCCC"> interaction significant</font>

548
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,980
material interactions beyond just what

549
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:45,990
goes on in this room then it would make

550
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:49,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">sense to go to dispatch with it okay so</font>

551
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:50,640
if you're if the fellows only way this

552
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:52,169
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current ice if it if you're</font>

553
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,299
proposing this then come here if you're

554
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:56,299
proposing this I can go to this back

555
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,510
anyone else<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay seems we don't have</font>

556
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:05,280
anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of people who are</font>

557
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:08,730
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been proposing it earlier major</font>

558
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,889
changes so maybe they me has gone away

559
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:13,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's that's completely okay i mean</font>

560
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:16,500
i think it's a it's a success to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

561
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:18,690
okay we're done and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can close the</font>

562
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,280
crew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a that's a success</font>

563
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,630
and it's good thing to do so we

564
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:24,149
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be inventing new work</font>

565
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,620
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't don't don't get it</font>

566
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:27,780
don't get that way what we want to do

567
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:30,299
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out easter someone who has a</font>

568
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,970
substantial drive to find the do new

569
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:32,440
stuff

570
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:34,809
eating the charter of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current clue</font>

571
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:39,210
that we should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing if not let's</font>

572
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:43,030
declare success and be done with it as

573
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:45,220
an option C maybe all that would be t OD

574
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:51,220
or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was gonna let</font>

575
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:52,960
us be one of the letters<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um so okay</font>

576
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:56,440
at least in this room we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a no</font>

577
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">one in the chapter or mythical saying we</font>

578
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,700
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing something um yeah well</font>

579
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,059
we still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have our milestones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to finish</font>

580
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:06,159
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not done this year anyway but</font>

581
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:10,299
hopefully by next meeting maybe we can

582
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:12,730
declare success okay well that gives us

583
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:16,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">a good amount of time to discuss some</font>

584
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:30,789
ice details this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> season</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

585
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:32,770
all been waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> christer yeah it</font>

586
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:34,450
says<font color="#E5E5E5"> here clarifications they are there</font>

587
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:38,650
are a few technical things here which is

588
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:43,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming up also originally I I didn't</font>

589
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:45,640
have too much time for this and when you

590
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,770
see some of the things I'm gonna present

591
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,380
to you you're probably wondering why am

592
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:52,750
I wasting everyone's time here you know

593
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:55,570
doing showing this why don't I just do a

594
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:57,280
pull request or you know suggest a fix

595
00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:01,658
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list and and you know we're done</font>

596
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:03,460
and and my we don't really know we have

597
00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:05,470
time but I mean my intention wasn't

598
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:09,100
really to go in and start discussing all

599
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:13,059
this issue well<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

600
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:15,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">out of waste is that in my opinion there</font>

601
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:17,049
are still some editorial work that we

602
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:18,460
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do in a draft it is difficult to</font>

603
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:20,740
read and that's not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> my opinion</font>

604
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:22,929
there's been some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who have our</font>

605
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,669
new two eyes who have read it them you

606
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:27,010
know please read it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> see what you</font>

607
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:30,730
think any it's a complex document to

608
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:32,799
read the intention is also not<font color="#E5E5E5"> too too</font>

609
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:35,289
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I when I wrote these things my my</font>

610
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,970
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> my tea was it's not to rewrite the</font>

611
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:40,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">whole you know spec to make it more</font>

612
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:43,100
readable I think these are things fairly

613
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,890
small<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that can be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dude</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done you</font>

614
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:48,020
know replacing some words removing some

615
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:50,210
sentence adding some sentence and those

616
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:52,510
kind of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the dis pic more</font>

617
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:55,310
readable actually before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> publish it</font>

618
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:58,129
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I said there's also some some</font>

619
00:32:55,310 --> 00:33:00,110
some technical issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere with one</font>

620
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:02,530
which we also already<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussed in in</font>

621
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:04,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">Berlin which was raised by by email</font>

622
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:08,120
unfortunately he's not there I don't

623
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:11,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if he's on there oh yeah he's not</font>

624
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:14,360
there either so but anyway so we'll come

625
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:17,060
to that but to show what I mean this is

626
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">something this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually somewhat</font>

627
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:23,750
someone said in Berlin when we discussed

628
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:27,110
mlc she and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember who it was</font>

629
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:29,060
but but you know I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this this it's</font>

630
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:31,909
not you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's maybe a little</font>

631
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:34,070
overrated but I think it you know shows

632
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:35,810
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is difficult to understand some</font>

633
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:39,980
of the parts and I think it's more I

634
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:43,100
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the discussions we had it's very</font>

635
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:45,800
much related to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what I call checklist</font>

636
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:48,139
interactions for example when you do

637
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:51,110
when you do checks on on on in one<font color="#CCCCCC"> check</font>

638
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:52,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">list how does it interact with with</font>

639
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:55,520
other check later when are you gonna

640
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:58,580
unfreeze candidates in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in another</font>

641
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:01,850
checklist and which ones and so on so

642
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:03,649
that's coming up here later also this is

643
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:06,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">something which was came up on the list</font>

644
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:08,960
a while ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pretty much died out</font>

645
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:11,570
because the guy said that you know they

646
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,810
have implemented wrong but i mean i'm

647
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:17,330
not sure but the issue is here that

648
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:20,480
today that when we do pruning the text

649
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:22,759
size that we basically do this so called

650
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:27,100
base replacement wherever<font color="#CCCCCC"> worried you</font>

651
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:29,960
know could put the base in the local

652
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:32,629
only applies to server if<font color="#E5E5E5"> elected to</font>

653
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">save candidates assuming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font>

654
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:36,830
you're never<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna send anything from</font>

655
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,779
the server flexi from the local

656
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:40,790
candidate so that's what we prune knows

657
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,889
but a thing which came up on a list was

658
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:45,139
that or the question was that doesn't

659
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:47,389
this also apply to 2p<font color="#CCCCCC"> reflexive</font>

660
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:50,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">candidates and obviously when you have</font>

661
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:52,100
your initial checklist you're not going

662
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:53,719
to have any pair reflexive candidates

663
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,509
because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will come later once you</font>

664
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">start with</font>

665
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,710
but what aspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> call success is that</font>

666
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:01,770
when you do find this pair reflexive

667
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:04,350
candidates you can update the checklist

668
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:07,110
and add them there and and send a new

669
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:10,020
one the new one to the remote end point

670
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:11,670
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> using stp or whatever and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

671
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:13,850
assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going to prune that</font>

672
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:15,930
checklist also i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if the draft</font>

673
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:17,220
explicit it says that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i assume</font>

674
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:19,109
you're going to do it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you used</font>

675
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,000
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know doing it because you're gonna</font>

676
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,080
have your server reflects the candidates

677
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,070
and everything in there so you will

678
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:28,170
prune it again so so so so so the idea

679
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:31,110
here was that should we'd also then

680
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:33,600
prune these appear reflexive candidates

681
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:39,900
and their basic two ways we could do

682
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:41,790
this and first is that just add to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

683
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,770
explicit text which talks about server

684
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:47,040
flexi candidates we also you know add

685
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:48,990
you know the pair of lexi wants the

686
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,970
second one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is one of the</font>

687
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:52,890
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> i talked about earlier this may</font>

688
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:55,020
seem like an easy fix but we need to

689
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:57,930
make sure it doesn't have any any side

690
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:02,880
effects is that we have a more generic

691
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:06,029
statement saying that you always replace

692
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,740
the local buy it by the base<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean in</font>

693
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,140
some cases they're going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> identical</font>

694
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:12,689
to begin with but I mean that's fair

695
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:15,600
enough but we but if we always replace

696
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:17,730
it our contacts just editorial because

697
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,440
server of Lexington<font color="#E5E5E5"> pure foxes are the</font>

698
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:21,860
only ones where the base is not equal to

699
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">the candidate because for host and</font>

700
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:27,720
relayed<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're equal yeah so how are</font>

701
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:30,030
how are these two statements effectively

702
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,319
different other than editorial and how

703
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,280
you presented editorial I agree is

704
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,900
important because the documents

705
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,520
confusing but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's the</font>

706
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,620
tactical decision I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked to it</font>

707
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Watari about this and and he</font>

708
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:42,690
mentioned that or he asked me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

709
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:46,170
should look into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP draft and look</font>

710
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:49,170
at this what do they<font color="#E5E5E5"> call her NAT NAT</font>

711
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:53,550
NAT assistant and a sister candidates uh

712
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:56,460
and and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did that but I don't think it</font>

713
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:58,320
would because my understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

714
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,020
even when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use not assisted</font>

715
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,880
candidates the the local candidate is

716
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,620
going to point<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the you know whatever</font>

717
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,400
then that gives you but the base is

718
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:10,230
still going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know your local</font>

719
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,880
you know your your your device and

720
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,760
that's from that's from where you're

721
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna send it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah i mean again</font>

722
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,480
thought about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp cases so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean it</font>

723
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:20,460
sounds like you know probably the

724
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,710
describing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in terms of two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay for</font>

725
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:24,650
UDP they're identical this is editorial

726
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:26,720
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i agree that I think to probably</font>

727
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:29,580
makes sense if there's you know

728
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,230
extensions in future though you don't

729
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,000
know i mean i think in participe you

730
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't signal them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as net as that</font>

731
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,900
assisted right you still will have to

732
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:41,640
use one of these four names I don't

733
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:43,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember that yeah and also a lot of</font>

734
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">these things in general that are</font>

735
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:46,470
critical presenting has a bit about

736
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,089
editorial nature but the thing is there

737
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,890
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spec is relatively</font>

738
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:51,740
complicated we don't want to do big

739
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:54,779
editorial changes without checking with

740
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:57,540
wider group of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right</font>

741
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:59,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing to do because it's easy to miss</font>

742
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,529
some corner case that only those two

743
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:04,290
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are aware and those two people to</font>

744
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:06,810
change who they are so depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

745
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:09,390
part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ice out so that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole</font>

746
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:11,640
whole idea of this set is to have you

747
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys think about this think about the</font>

748
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,660
own implementation the only way how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

749
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:21,270
did it justice conflict with the idea

750
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:27,390
you have in your head about ice so

751
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:29,759
regarding<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so both are fine yeah I</font>

752
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:32,549
think I mean my suggestion would be that

753
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,710
way we move ahead with with alternative

754
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:37,140
to but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> III make a pull request</font>

755
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:39,090
so so before we you know people don't

756
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:41,339
have to try to read this in your head

757
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:44,850
and and and people can look at it before

758
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:46,800
we before we submit a new version I mean

759
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:48,810
it's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple change editorial</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wise</font>

760
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,310
is just in one place in the document

761
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:52,770
where we have so it's not going to be a

762
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:54,600
big change is<font color="#CCCCCC"> its so from from that</font>

763
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:56,250
perspective it's easy and related to

764
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,839
this I didn't do a slide on that but

765
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:02,880
related to this is I also plan to align

766
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,950
terminology about base because sometimes

767
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,590
the documents a base sometimes it says

768
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:11,310
base candidate which was a little

769
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:13,710
confusing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think so i'm prob probably</font>

770
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:15,299
going to use base or I think candidate

771
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:18,270
base it's better but I'm gonna align

772
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:20,400
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> terminology anyways so columns are</font>

773
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:21,690
switching topics here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I'm very very</font>

774
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,200
sympathetic to how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much we tell you to</font>

775
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,790
do one thing

776
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,319
when yankee to somebody else editorial

777
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:27,810
and keep moving things back<font color="#E5E5E5"> I apologize</font>

778
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,339
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> advance for all of that um but I mean</font>

779
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:30,630
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems like we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have much more</font>

780
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:32,040
important things to be discussing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

781
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,390
like congestion control that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

782
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">really have one that works I mean we're</font>

783
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:39,299
going to get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that type of stuff this</font>

784
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:41,640
is editorial so good congestion control

785
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:45,270
as in not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> context of ice please but</font>

786
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:47,609
as in a new document as a nice piece as

787
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:49,829
a nice piece so um we had a oh yeah you

788
00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:51,598
were not there in the ti discussing we

789
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:53,400
had that already okay okay well that's

790
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,690
why I'll go over the man so he can

791
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,050
sedate you after we can revisit that

792
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:59,400
part um I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cree work for you</font>

793
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:00,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm not trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i was now saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

794
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,550
I just like okay I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

795
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we were that we had covered</font>

796
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,400
the really important issues before we

797
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,310
got to the editorial issues and yes like

798
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,780
we have so I yes it down thank you

799
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:11,578
although in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ti discussing let's say</font>

800
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,380
we didn't have everyone in the room yet

801
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:16,859
so maybe we want to revisit after this

802
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:19,500
again but uh anyway let's okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> iiii</font>

803
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:21,569
think this will be good and as I also

804
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,490
said I guess before he came in here is

805
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:25,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">that my intention was really not to</font>

806
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,819
spend a lot of this face-to-face time

807
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:29,098
with these issues I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> they will be I</font>

808
00:40:26,819 --> 00:40:30,630
will do pull request and so on but I

809
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:32,460
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make people aware of it</font>

810
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:34,710
that there are some still some work we'd

811
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,839
have to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it before we publish it but I</font>

812
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:38,970
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea is that we move forward</font>

813
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,470
with alternative to we take a look as in

814
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,328
an email on the lease<font color="#E5E5E5"> then and you know</font>

815
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:45,328
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> like email and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those you know can</font>

816
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:48,109
can can also look at barnard<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

817
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:51,109
it's not here but yeah me to go yeah

818
00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:53,819
yeah well I send it to listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yeah</font>

819
00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:55,859
the new versus Amy shisha I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

820
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:57,450
to rebreathe that up here is that but

821
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:59,970
basically what he says<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are</font>

822
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:04,700
cases where where you're going to

823
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:07,410
unfreeze the whole checklist you have a

824
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:08,490
frozen checklist and their case is where

825
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:10,470
you're gonna unfreeze the whole

826
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:13,200
checklist I think there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was already in</font>

827
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:16,348
Berlin someone who gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> a comment that</font>

828
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:19,200
he couldn't find anything in the spec

829
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:20,849
saying that email said that you know

830
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,250
yeah there is definitely these texts and

831
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:26,069
I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I couldn't find it either</font>

832
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:27,480
the text there there is some text and

833
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:30,599
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to that actually</font>

834
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:34,170
later where you will unfreeze for each

835
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:36,100
foundation one pair in the checklist so

836
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:40,270
maybe that was what email was was

837
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:43,720
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so so so we see about</font>

838
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:46,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that he was actually going and we had</font>

839
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,399
his table which you used which was I

840
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,740
think very useful which he used used to

841
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,270
you know demonstrate this problem the

842
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:57,459
idea was also to create a pull request

843
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:59,140
to get this into the spec he

844
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:02,110
unfortunately didn't have time to do

845
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:04,270
that I also I didn't have time to talk

846
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:06,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">about I sent him an email about this</font>

847
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:08,680
issue and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought are you sure you're</font>

848
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:13,420
right he didn't reply we are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

849
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:15,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a phone meeting after ITF and if we</font>

850
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,780
still think this is a big issue and we

851
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:18,850
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss it you know in the</font>

852
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group we're gonna talk with the</font>

853
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:22,779
chairs about having a phone conference

854
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:24,580
but but we see what happened so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

855
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:27,820
going to say more about that here now

856
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:30,670
but one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the comments which we was</font>

857
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:33,130
given by Peter when we discuss this is

858
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:35,110
that there could be cases where where

859
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:37,090
you would never unfreeze certain

860
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:41,590
candidate pairs and of course whatever

861
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:43,990
changes we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that that we need</font>

862
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:45,580
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make hair take care of make sure that</font>

863
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:47,560
doesn't happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that will</font>

864
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:49,060
happen either based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where I read and</font>

865
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:53,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">I sent you an email about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but but</font>

866
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:58,000
anyway so we need to figure that out

867
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:59,140
then there are a few aggressive when we

868
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,420
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> the removal of the Gracie</font>

869
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:03,580
nomination whenever we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did have a pull</font>

870
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:05,230
request and we remove the<font color="#CCCCCC"> steak</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but then</font>

871
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,750
I think Bernard find out that there is

872
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:10,900
still some some some some text that

873
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:16,000
needs to be modified or removed because

874
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:17,110
of this he has done a pull request you

875
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,830
have the link there if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can i</font>

876
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:22,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">encourage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you going have a look at it I</font>

877
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:25,660
think he sent the link or sun on the

878
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:28,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">mailing list it's not in the draft yet</font>

879
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:29,620
but unless there are any major issues

880
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:35,320
it's going to be in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

881
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:37,990
version this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something else which</font>

882
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,580
came up on on the list and i'm not going

883
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:42,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">to present</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different ways</font>

884
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:44,080
as you know we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

885
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,150
all these states and then we have a

886
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,850
checklist can be two types it can be

887
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:49,690
active when at least one other candidate

888
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:52,600
pair is in

889
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:54,910
a waiting state<font color="#E5E5E5"> and frozen if all the</font>

890
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:57,850
candidate pairs are frozen but then this

891
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:59,890
question is that ok but what if no

892
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:01,450
candidate is in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wedding state but</font>

893
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:04,150
one or more candidates are in the

894
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:07,089
in-progress state so my assumption is

895
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:09,750
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we are active and also but</font>

896
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:12,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">again this is this is a question i got</font>

897
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:14,710
from someone who weren't familiar ties

898
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:16,840
and I think this this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

899
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:21,340
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know fix it's a</font>

900
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:23,350
small editorial<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that was</font>

901
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:24,910
another thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the thing that</font>

902
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:26,650
came up on at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least do we need to talk</font>

903
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:28,390
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these lists types to the begin</font>

904
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:31,270
with I mean can't we say at least where

905
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:33,670
you know the pairs are frozen or at

906
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:35,350
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're if we're one or more pairs</font>

907
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:37,990
aren't frozen I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but those</font>

908
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:40,330
kind of things it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you</font>

909
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:42,250
read this because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all this you</font>

910
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:45,190
have a state you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a candidate pair</font>

911
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:48,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">States you you have the checklist state</font>

912
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:51,400
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the ice session state then you</font>

913
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:54,880
have these types of checklists and then

914
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:57,430
you have this ques<font color="#E5E5E5"> trigger check you and</font>

915
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:02,020
I mean it's kind of messy but but that's

916
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:04,299
really not this was more just about this

917
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:07,390
definition of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> assuming we're gonna</font>

918
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:11,140
go we're gonna keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> the active checklist</font>

919
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:13,270
that it should also cover when a

920
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:15,640
candidate bear is in progress Alex I

921
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:18,310
mean I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> things where are these</font>

922
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:20,680
states used and where the document is to

923
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:22,450
say if it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this site do this if it's</font>

924
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:24,279
not state do that that's the thing to

925
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:25,899
look at to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens you know</font>

926
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,310
figure out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> should happen if you</font>

927
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,900
know there's in progress but nothing is

928
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:31,000
waiting or everything's completed or

929
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:34,360
failed or so and so forth you know what

930
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,770
is you know ya mean even if there isn't

931
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:39,730
anywhere where this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is used then you can</font>

932
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:41,470
remove<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know it's the usual you</font>

933
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:43,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the dead code elimination and all</font>

934
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:46,750
that but and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that should</font>

935
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:48,610
hopefully tell us I think it is he use

936
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:50,260
because you have for example when you

937
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:51,760
have some race conditions then you take

938
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:54,130
this in progress in consideration<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

939
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,140
don't remember so my suggestion<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font>

940
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:59,020
really to remove any in any<font color="#CCCCCC"> states here</font>

941
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:01,240
I mean I'm saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know what</font>

942
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:03,579
the ants I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably you</font>

943
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:06,038
know if there's in progress not waiting

944
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:07,900
but you know if it's you know if we're

945
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:09,339
this is used is do you pull<font color="#E5E5E5"> one off to</font>

946
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:12,700
start it then obviously if you don't

947
00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:14,140
have anything waiting is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not relevant if</font>

948
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,879
it's something else then that's why

949
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:17,680
that's why I'd want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> i need to review</font>

950
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,920
the spec or hopefully have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> review</font>

951
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,058
this back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me to say where this</font>

952
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:25,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">is used to figure out what the right</font>

953
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:27,430
answers and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar question I get is</font>

954
00:46:25,509 --> 00:46:29,469
why do we need is valid least why don't

955
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:31,058
we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> define a new candidate pair</font>

956
00:46:29,469 --> 00:46:34,660
state which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> valid and then you know</font>

957
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:36,999
but idea again ah maybe that's a little

958
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:38,649
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than what we want to do at this</font>

959
00:46:36,999 --> 00:46:41,950
stage show so that's why I didn't add<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

960
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:43,930
to it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides then we have is</font>

961
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:45,999
sending from local candidate<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

962
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:48,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">sending from base there is some few</font>

963
00:46:45,999 --> 00:46:50,288
places in in the document which talks

964
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:52,150
about you know you send<font color="#CCCCCC"> a can you send</font>

965
00:46:50,289 --> 00:46:54,009
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you send us done request or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

966
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:58,829
connectivity check from from from the

967
00:46:54,009 --> 00:47:01,269
local candidate but as far as

968
00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:03,039
specification is concerned you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do</font>

969
00:47:01,269 --> 00:47:05,499
it you always send it from the base and

970
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:07,180
again in many<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases they're gonna be the</font>

971
00:47:05,499 --> 00:47:08,709
same right so but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know</font>

972
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:11,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not the point the point is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

973
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:12,940
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the definition so over or</font>

974
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:14,890
what local candidate and what base means

975
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:17,499
you're always<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send it the</font>

976
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:19,029
connectivity checks from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> base so the</font>

977
00:47:17,499 --> 00:47:23,410
suggestion basically would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be here is</font>

978
00:47:19,029 --> 00:47:25,329
that you know we do that modification

979
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:26,890
also it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in too many places in the</font>

980
00:47:25,329 --> 00:47:31,569
document so i guess this this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

981
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:34,359
be a big rewrite so but but check that

982
00:47:31,569 --> 00:47:35,709
or or I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing the</font>

983
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:37,239
local candidate is going to be used for

984
00:47:35,709 --> 00:47:39,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">its when the other one send stuff to you</font>

985
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:46,599
surprise but you always<font color="#E5E5E5"> your checks are</font>

986
00:47:39,729 --> 00:47:48,698
always sent from from the base<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

987
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:52,410
there goes another thing and the Beast

988
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:56,349
draft this is when you start unfreezing

989
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:59,979
one of the checklists it says uncheck

990
00:47:56,349 --> 00:48:03,009
the first media stream and but there is

991
00:47:59,979 --> 00:48:07,379
no guidance ok what does first media

992
00:48:03,009 --> 00:48:11,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">story me does it need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have some</font>

993
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:15,190
specific characteristics is it the most

994
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:17,349
you know you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is it I mean in</font>

995
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:20,140
and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone can say</font>

996
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:22,479
it's the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> M line in sdp but keep in</font>

997
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:24,670
mind this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> this teepee so for</font>

998
00:48:22,479 --> 00:48:27,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">example in in in the music spec we may</font>

999
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:30,910
say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know when you use this with</font>

1000
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:33,399
cpt p then first first media stream it

1001
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:35,828
means the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> M line in stp but I</font>

1002
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,599
think we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> say something here if we</font>

1003
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:40,029
don't say anything else we should at

1004
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,739
least say that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the meaning of</font>

1005
00:48:40,029 --> 00:48:43,180
first media stream<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a selection of</font>

1006
00:48:41,739 --> 00:48:45,249
first media stream is outside the scope

1007
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:48,368
of this document and need to be defined

1008
00:48:45,249 --> 00:48:50,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">by each usage usage of ice but the way</font>

1009
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:54,249
it's written<font color="#E5E5E5"> now it's completely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unclear</font>

1010
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">jump</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I agree that it's yeah the ordering</font>

1011
00:48:54,249 --> 00:48:56,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not just which one is first but the</font>

1012
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,630
total ordering because there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1013
00:48:56,859 --> 00:49:00,940
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it's not just the first one</font>

1014
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:02,079
but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is also used in the</font>

1015
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:05,589
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of places and I think that has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1016
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:07,119
be defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the using respects or what</font>

1017
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:09,910
is the order the total order of the

1018
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,259
media streams and I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking for</font>

1019
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:13,629
example when I talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1020
00:49:11,259 --> 00:49:15,460
characteristics I mean I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess in</font>

1021
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:17,049
most cases if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have multiple streams</font>

1022
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,999
in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal case you're gonna have an</font>

1023
00:49:17,049 --> 00:49:22,029
equal amount of candidates for each of

1024
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:23,738
them but in theory you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could have I mean</font>

1025
00:49:22,029 --> 00:49:25,690
let's say that you have some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1026
00:49:23,739 --> 00:49:27,759
media stream that you for whatever

1027
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:31,029
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> you always want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to send it</font>

1028
00:49:27,759 --> 00:49:33,930
through a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a turn server so you're not</font>

1029
00:49:31,029 --> 00:49:36,759
gonna collect other candidates for it

1030
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:38,739
but then for it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me finish this</font>

1031
00:49:36,759 --> 00:49:40,390
I have it in my head so that saw them

1032
00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:42,549
but then for your ad or other media

1033
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:45,549
streams you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all this host local</font>

1034
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:47,829
or whatever so I thought that first

1035
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:49,569
media stream the characteristics should

1036
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:53,650
probably be a media stream where you

1037
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:55,420
have a lot big large set of candidates

1038
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:57,160
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think so Jonathan Maddox I</font>

1039
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:59,049
mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is that the</font>

1040
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,368
case you're describing is a subset of

1041
00:49:59,049 --> 00:50:02,440
some of the more complicated cases

1042
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:05,499
because there's also the case like the

1043
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:07,630
pure distributed media case where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1044
00:50:05,499 --> 00:50:09,160
know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kalihi foundations on stream 1</font>

1045
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,739
and the patient's on stream two are

1046
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,848
entirely disjoint yeah because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1047
00:50:11,739 --> 00:50:15,249
they're actually two different boxes

1048
00:50:12,849 --> 00:50:18,249
that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> controlling um which we have</font>

1049
00:50:15,249 --> 00:50:20,589
to handle um I think this gets into the

1050
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:23,738
email table issue where it's like it's

1051
00:50:20,589 --> 00:50:25,930
not it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first stream that has this</font>

1052
00:50:23,739 --> 00:50:27,039
foundation that caught that you know and

1053
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:29,078
then things like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1054
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:30,730
possibly the whole description of the

1055
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:31,930
algorithm needs to be

1056
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:36,060
I think so there's like I think I

1057
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:39,790
pointed this out to JDR latent in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1058
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:41,170
development of 5245 and I think there's

1059
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:43,570
some word some text in there which is

1060
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:45,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">already which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of flaky about</font>

1061
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:47,369
that so we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to even real make</font>

1062
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:51,520
sure we actually have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm</font>

1063
00:50:47,369 --> 00:50:53,470
well specified so it's like you know the

1064
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,810
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you start check</font>

1065
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:59,169
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the first media stream that</font>

1066
00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:00,490
has this foundation<font color="#E5E5E5"> or that I'm not</font>

1067
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:02,440
described I'm not guy works with of the

1068
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:04,750
mic but basically that's what starts out

1069
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:07,240
as unfrozen you know the first the first

1070
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:09,100
check with this foundation or something

1071
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:11,410
I mean you I<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully understand what I</font>

1072
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:14,170
mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the meal table but this is</font>

1073
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:15,490
the this is the area where we need to

1074
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:18,640
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is right for these</font>

1075
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:19,959
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> distributed media cases or you know</font>

1076
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:23,109
like you said one legal assistants

1077
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:25,660
return or you know once one media stream

1078
00:51:23,109 --> 00:51:27,100
the turn server failed so you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1079
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:28,000
a turn candidate for that stream or

1080
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,500
something like that that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of</font>

1081
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,800
cases like this and it also interacts

1082
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:35,260
with a lot of the trickle cases yeah so

1083
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,720
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe we I mean wait maybe in 45 for</font>

1084
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:40,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">bass we don't need to go into much</font>

1085
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,589
detail of that but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think at least we</font>

1086
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:43,869
should say that you know there must be a

1087
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:54,820
mechanism for usage to define<font color="#CCCCCC"> what is</font>

1088
00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:59,950
the first first first media streamers we

1089
00:51:54,820 --> 00:52:03,160
the I've I don't well as far as 5245

1090
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:05,950
beasts is concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the first one</font>

1091
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:08,950
matters because then when you when you

1092
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:11,049
when you find when when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> six so when I</font>

1093
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:12,819
check succeeds you're going to go

1094
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:14,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all your other checklist and see</font>

1095
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:17,619
if you have matching foundation in those

1096
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:19,240
there is no word there is no text about

1097
00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:21,040
saying then you go to the second

1098
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,720
checklist and then is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there but but</font>

1099
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,570
there's the issue that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I just</font>

1100
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,759
mentioning that is again the distribute

1101
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:30,220
media case where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if a certain</font>

1102
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,320
foundation only appears in the second

1103
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:34,720
one is it's like in the second and the

1104
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:36,970
third then you go and start that check

1105
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,529
on the second I know which<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is second</font>

1106
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:40,569
you know you need to know have a total

1107
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:42,430
order so we can find which is the first

1108
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:44,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">one for each foundation I hear what</font>

1109
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:46,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're saying but that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not how how</font>

1110
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:49,720
how its defined today everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1111
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:51,880
starts from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first media stream and</font>

1112
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:55,359
then you have your resume be a bug it

1113
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:57,250
difficult for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you well okay so so and</font>

1114
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,960
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not how i implement so so we</font>

1115
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:01,060
should wanted to work where I ok so with

1116
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,190
you know but you know have a little have

1117
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:05,230
a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but that Jonathan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um do</font>

1118
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:07,690
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us a volunteer to make a pull</font>

1119
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:10,120
request on clarifying text oh maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1120
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:13,060
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is little more than a</font>

1121
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:15,220
pull request<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay accurate because this</font>

1122
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:16,990
is more this is more yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I saw I</font>

1123
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:18,850
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> related to the mill table</font>

1124
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:21,089
issue and think so maybe I need to you

1125
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:23,680
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss it on the on the list ok so</font>

1126
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:27,940
let's figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the call on that um</font>

1127
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:31,180
Jonathan<font color="#E5E5E5"> Emil</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> christer more sometime</font>

1128
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:36,720
soon after this meeting excellent<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok we</font>

1129
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:36,720
had notes note takers take that note of

1130
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:41,500
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a small check</font>

1131
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:43,810
but again a question I got a stalker

1132
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:45,550
connectivity checks in in in the

1133
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:47,980
definition<font color="#CCCCCC"> for waiting the definition</font>

1134
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:50,320
waiting for says is that check has not

1135
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:52,810
been performed for this pair and then

1136
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:54,970
comes and it can be formed as soon as it

1137
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:56,440
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the highest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> priority waiting pair on</font>

1138
00:53:54,970 --> 00:54:00,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> checklist but that's not really true</font>

1139
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:02,830
because you're always gonna send trigger

1140
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:04,720
checks first no matter what the

1141
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:06,940
priorities at least I couldn't find any

1142
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,490
text saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you when when when</font>

1143
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:11,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have a trigger when you trigger</font>

1144
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:13,419
checks suddenly you know you raise the

1145
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:16,690
priority i mean the priority has been

1146
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:19,750
calculated before a pair becomes is

1147
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:22,450
added to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trigger queue so so so I</font>

1148
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:24,610
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are triggered tracks pull up</font>

1149
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:31,839
my checklist at all<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

1150
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:33,850
immediately<font color="#CCCCCC"> e Twitter checks called</font>

1151
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:35,530
trigger check you if I which is not the

1152
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:40,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">same thing as the checklist they are a</font>

1153
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:42,720
little checklist are they ya kicked out

1154
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:48,730
that's do they go to waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> state I</font>

1155
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:49,600
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> all figure tricks don't go</font>

1156
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:51,340
to weddings take<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they just</font>

1157
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">send immediately yeah their descent</font>

1158
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,980
immediately they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not sent</font>

1159
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,720
immediately they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

1160
00:54:53,980 --> 00:55:00,440
under tech they are going to this

1161
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:08,839
highest this this trigger queue and they

1162
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:10,910
are sent at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Wow oh but</font>

1163
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:14,060
his point is that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the trigger queue</font>

1164
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:15,319
is not empty then even though something

1165
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,849
is the highest party waiting for the

1166
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,500
checklist it still can't be performed

1167
00:55:16,849 --> 00:55:20,540
immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is the argument so</font>

1168
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:23,060
this is the wording there is not quite

1169
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:26,480
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what he's claiming which I</font>

1170
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:28,640
guess I kind of see yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I mean my</font>

1171
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,410
point is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1172
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,330
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> definition for waiting we don't</font>

1173
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:34,640
really need to say when when when when

1174
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:36,170
when when when something is<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be</font>

1175
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,240
sent I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think it was so I</font>

1176
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:41,000
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically I think we could could</font>

1177
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,879
could could remove this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just says</font>

1178
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:47,210
that that a check has not been performed

1179
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:49,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">for this but will be it's ready to be</font>

1180
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:50,869
performed when i played this some some

1181
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:52,369
word but my point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we don't really</font>

1182
00:55:50,869 --> 00:55:57,530
need to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this because this</font>

1183
00:55:52,369 --> 00:55:59,750
belongs elsewhere yeah yeah something

1184
00:55:57,530 --> 00:56:01,580
like that yeah to make sure this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is now</font>

1185
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:06,619
in a state where it's going to be sent

1186
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:09,589
or OSHA and related to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that in</font>

1187
00:56:06,619 --> 00:56:11,990
the same sections the<font color="#E5E5E5"> definition for</font>

1188
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:13,910
frozen says that are checking a check

1189
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:17,359
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this pair hasn't been performed and</font>

1190
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:19,609
it can can't be performed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you</font>

1191
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:24,259
have involved until some other chick

1192
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:26,869
succeeds but pairs can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually be</font>

1193
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:30,589
unfrozen also do to address and it's not

1194
00:56:26,869 --> 00:56:32,869
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> always when something succeeds for</font>

1195
00:56:30,589 --> 00:56:37,070
example if they if they if the timer

1196
00:56:32,869 --> 00:56:38,960
expires and they are no waiting no<font color="#E5E5E5"> pairs</font>

1197
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:41,750
in the waiting state then you are going

1198
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start unfreezing the frozen ones but</font>

1199
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:51,550
that's done because of that not because

1200
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:53,900
of another check being done but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

1201
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:57,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure how much where do we need</font>

1202
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:59,380
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really specifies here you know when</font>

1203
00:56:57,109 --> 00:57:02,000
when and if they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a baby</font>

1204
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:04,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfrozen the important thing here is</font>

1205
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,820
that saying that they are frozen and and

1206
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:10,430
and not they will not be checked until

1207
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:12,440
they are unfrozen do too

1208
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:19,368
the procedures in<font color="#E5E5E5"> dispatch something</font>

1209
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:21,260
like that unfree single checklist and

1210
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:23,240
this is a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is maybe religion</font>

1211
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:25,430
related nah I don't think actually think

1212
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:27,979
this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> emmys issue this is another</font>

1213
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:30,290
issue for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have text saying</font>

1214
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:32,390
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> once all pairs in a checklist are</font>

1215
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:34,509
either in failed or succeeded state

1216
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:37,460
which means you have tested them all

1217
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:40,490
that the other checklists are unfrozen

1218
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:42,410
and that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little strange for me</font>

1219
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:44,660
because they that you have one checklist

1220
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:46,190
where everything where is done but then

1221
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:49,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have another checklist which you are</font>

1222
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:50,900
still working on so why<font color="#CCCCCC"> should he Jen</font>

1223
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">just go and unfreeze everything else I</font>

1224
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,829
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should work with that one and</font>

1225
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:58,270
and and test those things and you go on

1226
00:57:54,829 --> 00:58:00,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">and go on I think you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't really</font>

1227
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:04,520
when oh when the only thing you have

1228
00:58:00,829 --> 00:58:05,990
left is unfrozen checklists when you

1229
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:07,819
don't have anything else that's going to

1230
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:09,558
trigger the text then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start</font>

1231
00:58:07,819 --> 00:58:11,960
unfreezing them if you still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have them</font>

1232
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:14,180
and I guess this could happen if in this

1233
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:16,400
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we talked about earlier</font>

1234
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:17,930
but I don't think just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because one</font>

1235
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,819
checklist is done you should go and

1236
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:25,460
unfreeze everything else I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1237
00:58:19,819 --> 00:58:27,829
that that's ma yeah so so so my

1238
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:29,809
suggestion would I don't have it at this

1239
00:58:27,829 --> 00:58:31,849
I need to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little how to word it</font>

1240
00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:34,160
but the ID here is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

1241
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:35,930
don't you don't automatically unfreeze

1242
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:43,190
auto checklist until you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1243
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:53,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">have any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything else to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1244
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:59,630
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was it so again there is some some</font>

1245
00:58:53,410 --> 00:59:02,509
editorial ish work still to be done like

1246
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:05,000
I said they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were they were up I had many</font>

1247
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:07,760
slides but the change is required for

1248
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:11,030
each for each issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not that big i</font>

1249
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:14,420
think but i think it will make the draft

1250
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:16,339
much more readable so that's why i

1251
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:19,609
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it before before we</font>

1252
00:59:16,339 --> 00:59:21,200
you know before we publish and and you

1253
00:59:19,609 --> 00:59:23,480
know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> people still think it's not</font>

1254
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,899
readable after that and you know at

1255
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:28,670

1256
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:29,839

01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:06,410
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> latest version</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the beast draft</font>

1269
01:00:02,839 --> 01:00:10,009
and there is currently a pull request to

1270
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:11,569
align<font color="#E5E5E5"> Appendix B very small change then</font>

1271
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:13,700
I said hey this is basic what the change

1272
01:00:11,569 --> 01:00:15,680
is and I see the researcher arrow it

1273
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:17,720
says 50 milliseconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> there it should be</font>

1274
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">5 milliseconds and that actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buggy</font>

1275
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:22,279
existing in the in the draft also i

1276
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,930
checked that so so it was not mine but

1277
01:00:22,279 --> 01:00:26,059
basically what it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tea</font>

1278
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:28,848
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tea a value is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> milliseconds but</font>

1279
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:31,010
you can use either values then it talks

1280
01:00:28,849 --> 01:00:33,289
about this global<font color="#CCCCCC"> T value to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1281
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:35,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">into consideration and then read some</font>

1282
01:00:33,289 --> 01:00:37,359
text talking about why 5 millisecond is

1283
01:00:35,569 --> 01:00:40,849
good for ice but it's not good for

1284
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:42,170
transport protocol in general so so I

1285
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:43,940
was worried more about the congestion

1286
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:45,890
control issue so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had this thread with</font>

1287
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:49,339
the transport people talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about not</font>

1288
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:52,430
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than ten outstanding packets unruh</font>

1289
01:00:49,339 --> 01:00:57,470
on replied packets and<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact there's the</font>

1290
01:00:52,430 --> 01:01:01,098
<font color="#CCCCCC">person to speak to it right there okay</font>

1291
01:00:57,470 --> 01:01:02,589
so if you go read the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole list or two</font>

1292
01:01:01,099 --> 01:01:04,520
or three or however many there were

1293
01:01:02,589 --> 01:01:06,440
you'll see that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pattern was</font>

1294
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:08,960
basically that they had a set of three

1295
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:11,059
rules the transport guys that they

1296
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,680
wanted and in the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ice those</font>

1297
01:01:11,059 --> 01:01:14,690
basically reduced down to one rule and

1298
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:19,339
the one rule was that they had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

1299
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:21,890
global ta of five milliseconds interest

1300
01:01:19,339 --> 01:01:23,450
I mean I the math I saw was 500

1301
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:25,759
milliseconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT unless you knew</font>

1302
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:27,379
otherwise and not more than ten

1303
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,089
outstanding packets which would imply a

1304
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:31,339
TA of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 milliseconds not five</font>

1305
01:01:29,089 --> 01:01:34,940
milliseconds yeah so later it down in

1306
01:01:31,339 --> 01:01:36,980
the discussion they said well actually

1307
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:39,369
instead of 10 it can be a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and at</font>

1308
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:39,369
that point

1309
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:45,089
at that point<font color="#CCCCCC"> five milliseconds was the</font>

1310
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,849
bottleneck not the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of outs inning</font>

1311
01:01:45,089 --> 01:01:49,078
go read the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole thing I mean it's</font>

1312
01:01:47,849 --> 01:01:50,880
a long email discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> well you can</font>

1313
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:52,650
read all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it the problem is is during</font>

1314
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,420
the way people use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> email addresses</font>

1315
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:56,250
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF works I don't get many of the</font>

1316
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:58,410
emails for the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who were on it you</font>

1317
01:01:56,250 --> 01:02:01,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">can my fault you could have you can also</font>

1318
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:02,700
go read the cy says and there's send

1319
01:02:01,109 --> 01:02:04,348
that explanation the whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1320
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:06,299
explained in the pull request let the

1321
01:02:04,349 --> 01:02:09,150
the reasoning what max ban but we end up

1322
01:02:06,299 --> 01:02:12,109
on that the same one<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would get with</font>

1323
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:17,700
the rules that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they that they proposed</font>

1324
01:02:12,109 --> 01:02:19,380
it was it I have to do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> math it was</font>

1325
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:22,230
it was in the ballpark of what we were

1326
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:24,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying okay I don't want to say a number</font>

1327
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:28,109
is they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't it's the kind of number</font>

1328
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:32,309
that we were proposing earlier to be the

1329
01:02:28,109 --> 01:02:33,900
max rate<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and we were comfortable</font>

1330
01:02:32,309 --> 01:02:35,190
that like the eighties link I she's

1331
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:38,759
gonna be on board with this hundred

1332
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:40,529
outstanding unrequested packets well all

1333
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:48,990
the experts in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the area of congestion</font>

1334
01:02:40,529 --> 01:02:50,970
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> were so okay so I'm shocked and</font>

1335
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:52,618
would not be surprised to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see this back</font>

1336
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:54,209
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> again on the it didn't turn out to</font>

1337
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:56,339
be quite that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's wonderful if</font>

1338
01:02:54,210 --> 01:03:00,450
it's all resolved I guess he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best</font>

1339
01:02:56,339 --> 01:03:02,400
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> got so far I Colin so I I</font>

1340
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:04,319
don't recall the outcome of the

1341
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,480
discussion but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it really is a hundred</font>

1342
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:08,009
i would suggest that someone checks with

1343
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,690
one of the transport guys to

1344
01:03:08,009 --> 01:03:14,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">double-check that that would be from</font>

1345
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:20,730
different for guys yeah so so as I say I

1346
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:22,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">specifically so as I say I don't recall</font>

1347
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:24,839
the outcome of that discussion but if it

1348
01:03:22,529 --> 01:03:26,490
really is a hundred packets outstanding

1349
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:27,720
I think you should check with someone

1350
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:29,038
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transport to make sure that</font>

1351
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:32,759
there hasn't business being lost in

1352
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:35,700
translation again you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> check the</font>

1353
01:03:32,759 --> 01:03:37,650
email thread but I mean I was very clear

1354
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:40,379
saying okay this is this is what you

1355
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:41,789
want and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> write the Rope wrote the</font>

1356
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:43,490
poll<font color="#E5E5E5"> request with all the explanation</font>

1357
01:03:41,789 --> 01:03:47,039
they proof read the pull request they

1358
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:48,808
specified here the ITF RFC's that you

1359
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:49,260
that we need a reference and everything

1360
01:03:48,809 --> 01:03:53,130
so

1361
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:54,690
so cold feet about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Colin pokin so I mean</font>

1362
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:57,120
I'm not disagreeing with any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

1363
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:59,280
believe you did all of those things but

1364
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:01,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">as a transport person myself and not</font>

1365
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,450
someone who's commented on this I

1366
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:04,980
suspect if you go to the transport and

1367
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:06,330
say it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred packets outstanding</font>

1368
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:10,260
without any feedback you'll get her oh

1369
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:12,390
really so as I say I would recommend and

1370
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:13,920
I if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you dont les entirely up to you but</font>

1371
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:16,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would recommend you double check with</font>

1372
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:20,790
transferred a tease I don't know gentle

1373
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:27,930
ladies are but yeah yeah Alyssa Cooper I

1374
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:29,520
don't so yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> send</font>

1375
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:31,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">it to tsv art but I really feel that</font>

1376
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,060
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfair to you to be badgered about</font>

1377
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:34,950
what you did because you did<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the</font>

1378
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:36,690
right thing and there's a long thread

1379
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:38,700
about this on the ice mailing list that

1380
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:41,040
includes a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> input from Jenna and</font>

1381
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:44,910
David black which were the instigators

1382
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:47,370
of this originally so I I think you did

1383
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:49,560
a good job with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so just one more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1384
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:51,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the back-up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plan is basically to</font>

1385
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:54,120
you know if if somebody says you know we

1386
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,830
we can't go forward with just rule<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 out</font>

1387
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:58,319
of the three<font color="#E5E5E5"> because reduced down to the</font>

1388
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:59,880
third we could just back up and expand

1389
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,860
it back to the three rules and the three

1390
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:04,800
rules are still basically in there but

1391
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:06,570
there as part of an explanation and if

1392
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:09,030
it can't the worst-case scenario is that

1393
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:10,410
we take the reduced rule and expand it

1394
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:12,420
back to the three rules and make it not

1395
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:16,319
normative instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> vicks explanatory</font>

1396
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:18,930
but it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem like that's</font>

1397
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:20,220
necessary so I just once I didn't want

1398
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:23,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come across wrong I like thank you</font>

1399
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:27,209
for driving that into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ground not</font>

1400
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:29,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">easy so thanks this is ben campbell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

1401
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:32,010
comment on history how we got here I

1402
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:35,400
realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's always a concern</font>

1403
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:37,200
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tsv a DS may surprise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this but</font>

1404
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,850
we got here by going to the TS<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1405
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,129
80s and they sent us to these people to

1406
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:42,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about it so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we come back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>
