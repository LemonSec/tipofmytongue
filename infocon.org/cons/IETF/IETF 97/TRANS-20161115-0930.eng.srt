1
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,629
then that gives the log operators the

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,770
ability to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make that policy decision but</font>

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,570
in the absence that that would be the

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:16,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">only blocker for the best document and</font>

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,519
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think peter has some stuff to say</font>

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:23,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> try and hit the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the new</font>

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:28,729
button so Peter you can now speak I

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:31,799
think yes can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hear me we do know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ah</font>

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,420
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know there's the how</font>

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,140
do we technically do this and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,610
the other half is understand you know

12
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,070
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do this I mean I know there's</font>

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:44,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">been a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of question about what part</font>

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,309
should be redacted and you know because

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is also the previous slide suggests</font>

16
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:50,788
this is just looking at subject

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">alternative names and be NSA's but it's</font>

18
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,510
also been brought up you know that

19
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,629
subject names frequently end up with

20
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,250
your personal information in them and I

21
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,920
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that saying that needs direct</font>

22
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,410
addressing on this because you know yes

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,840
logs might now be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reject sorry</font>

24
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:10,080
might be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> now reject serfs moving</font>

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,299
to should but not good that they should

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,158
reject every sir just because it has

27
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,500
what appears to be a personal name in

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">this earth that doesn't actually solve</font>

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,830
the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of core problem of how do we</font>

30
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,220
get to a you know world of sikhi

31
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,220
everywhere

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,130
so with the periodicity correctly you're

33
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,320
saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the like policy change from</font>

34
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,440
a master shoot by itself will<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be</font>

35
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:47,509
enough to address<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue of of</font>

36
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:49,950
personal certificates well I'm saying it

37
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:53,550
it half addresses it because it allows

38
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,670
the blog to reject<font color="#E5E5E5"> the request to log a</font>

39
00:01:53,550 --> 00:02:00,690
personal cert but it doesn't I mean if

40
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,580
the if the objective is to log all

41
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:06,600
search that are reasonably usable on

42
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:09,389
websites I mean what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do when when</font>

43
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,190
there is a website that has say a first

44
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,190
name and last name in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certificate</font>

45
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:21,660
Peter would<font color="#CCCCCC"> it be fair to say that you</font>

46
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:24,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">believe that the must to should change</font>

47
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:28,200
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right change to be made for the</font>

48
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:31,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">BIST document and that the scenarios</font>

49
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,018
relative to personal serfs and redaction

50
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:37,640
are something that should be covered<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

51
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:42,600
the redaction specification

52
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:45,059
independently yes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a way</font>

53
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,780
that the muster should a lot of 1660

54
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,870
give this to give the opportunity out

55
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,220
and then we still I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a working</font>

56
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,269
groups off to address the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other half of</font>

57
00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:01,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">the problem do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have other scenarios</font>

58
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:03,959
that you can think of as examples that

59
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,988
<font color="#CCCCCC">you think should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> covered in that this</font>

60
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,200
document<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we should consider as</font>

61
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:12,810
scenarios well I think the other one

62
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,760
that has there's been suggestions are

63
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,269
changing the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> documents to a movie</font>

64
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,670
techno constrained option arm or my

65
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:23,160
beloved section<font color="#CCCCCC"> or I think the concern</font>

66
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:26,820
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there is also even at the base</font>

67
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:30,450
domain their third question is do we

68
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:32,519
handle you know the buying the binding

69
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,109
of just knowing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> short of a cert</font>

70
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,049
is to a different domain can be

71
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,660
automatic especially in the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

72
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:41,520
enterprise CA scenario

73
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,730
or however you want to put it because

74
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,700
simply knowing that you know example

75
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:50,989
corpse CA is issued for new thing calm

76
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:53,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">can actually you know get privacy if you</font>

77
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,620
origins<font color="#E5E5E5"> a privacy to incorporate secrecy</font>

78
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:00,090
issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sort of almost conclude chairs</font>

79
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:02,160
but it thank you that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great</font>

80
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,960
example of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario that that really</font>

81
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:09,870
should be considered in the redaction

82
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:12,090
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so so then I think the last</font>

83
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">issue we have in relation to the bits</font>

84
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:19,019
document and pushing it into ITF last

85
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:23,370
call would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the historic fetching of</font>

86
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:25,380
sths and so is there anyone who thinks

87
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:30,870
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the addition of this API would be a</font>

88
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:34,680
problem and they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> no one who really</font>

89
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:37,110
wants it so I as i mentioned i think it

90
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,830
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like a nice optional API but</font>

91
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,660
you would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i like if there</font>

92
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,849
was that come<font color="#E5E5E5"> with monitoring api a</font>

93
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,290
document then it would have liked that

94
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,650
document will do in a much better place

95
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,300
for its<font color="#E5E5E5"> api so so you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it</font>

96
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:56,070
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> a change in the biz document hey</font>

97
00:04:51,300 --> 00:05:00,480
squirt I've it looks like Rob straddling

98
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:03,570
isn't in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> media meeting here but I've</font>

99
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:07,110
spoken with him and I know that he

100
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:09,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">forcier TSH it would like to see a REST</font>

101
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,810
API that would be standardized for

102
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:15,240
services like that and my<font color="#CCCCCC"> personal</font>

103
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:18,330
opinion again this is Ryan Hurst is that

104
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,550
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular API is an</font>

105
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:23,640
example of something that belongs inside

106
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:29,060
of a broader query API instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just a</font>

107
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:32,490
bolt on to the log infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

108
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:34,260
so it seems most people want is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

109
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,860
be in a biz document itself and in the

110
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:40,050
the new log monitoring API that was my

111
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:43,860
opinion I see lots of nothing and nobody

112
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:47,430
rushing to the mic<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay so that</font>

113
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:50,550
would mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that once you update</font>

114
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,420
the section 51 we can put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the document</font>

115
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,640
into ITF last call

116
00:05:52,420 --> 00:06:02,260
and in the meantime if somebody wants to

117
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:04,390
draft at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> death</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the API</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um so</font>

118
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,250
then we get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the two new items new</font>

119
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:08,409
work that were on the agenda one is the

120
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,720
log monitoring API I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if just</font>

121
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,630
anyone here that wants to talk about

122
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but otherwise we can just keep that</font>

123
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,980
discussion on them on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> list for now</font>

124
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:22,090
because there definitely seems to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

125
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:25,030
interest and the other item is the

126
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:27,609
expect CT TLS header which will be

127
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:31,239
discussed later in the HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece</font>

128
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,680
working group on thursday so that's not

129
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:39,250
something we need to discuss here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

130
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:40,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">think go ahead yeah around me sir so</font>

131
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,690
just one more thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this I've</font>

132
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:45,130
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reference implementation</font>

133
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:47,380
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently at my personal like</font>

134
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:52,300
github repo and there is a link I think

135
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:53,440
inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 of the presentation it so it</font>

136
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,090
only does like two things right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

137
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,130
which is like adding a chain and then

138
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,169
providing an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ST age but it all does it</font>

139
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:02,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">always like with 66 to these data</font>

140
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:04,510
structures so I I would appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

141
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">people had a look i'm particularly</font>

142
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:08,800
looking for fightin reviewers for the

143
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,559
code so i can merge it upstream back to

very much that it would be really good

171
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,570
to get this document out because it's

172
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,740
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost ready right i mean one</font>

173
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the problems we've been having is</font>

174
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,530
that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been getting absolutely no</font>

175
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,689
feedback from the mailing list when we

176
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:50,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">raise this question and it's made it</font>

177
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:53,370
impossible to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move on um so if</font>

178
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:56,280
anybody does have any opinions idea that

179
00:08:53,370 --> 00:09:00,780
you know time to raise them here if you

180

181

182
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:08,790
to Daniel's out and and then I'm really

183
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,910
shopping for that one so as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

184
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:16,530
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it a write-up Dunham</font>

through the process this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> general Khan</font>

186
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,850
Gilmore so I feel a little bit

187
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:25,319
responsible for this impasse and erase

188
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:28,290
me initiate attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I tried to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

189
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,510
review of the discussion in the back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

190
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,390
forth and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a ton of texts</font>

191
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,620
yeah and there's walls of text in

192
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,060
multiple different directions and

193
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,840
there's complaints in different

194
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:42,390
directions and I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself stymied by</font>

195
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,740
you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't even like everyone</font>

196
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,380
was agreeing on what they were trying to

197
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">do in the discussion so I kind of threw</font>

198
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,110
out my hands and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was like i like i</font>

199
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,570
can't i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how to unpick all of</font>

200
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:55,140
that um in terms of specifically

201
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:56,790
describing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> duel CA attack I felt</font>

202
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the text that was there that was</font>

203
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,839
describing the attack was correct so

204
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah so you mean it to fit text from</font>

205
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,800
David that isn't in the document or the

206
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">checks it isn't enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

207
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,130
the Texas in the latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> version</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

208
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:13,380
document it that but this is what I mean

209
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,760
the discussion around that text was like

210
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,800
well there's this other text thats

211
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,600
related<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the duel CA attack that isn't</font>

212
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,410
the fault of CT<font color="#E5E5E5"> that shouldn't be</font>

213
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,009
present there

214
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:24,750
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I write is this is this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> memory</font>

215
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:26,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it I haven't looked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at it recently</font>

216
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,699
because I don't want to reach<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rama ties</font>

217
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:31,378
<font color="#E5E5E5">myself but but when I when I believe</font>

218
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:32,609
it's the most recent version<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font>

219
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:34,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the Texas in there does actually</font>

220
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,810
describe the<font color="#CCCCCC"> duel CA attack that least</font>

221
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is talking about the duel CA</font>

222
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,949
attack now whether that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fault of</font>

223
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:44,490
CT or not or whether that's an acct can

224
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:47,279
fix or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know i don't believe</font>

225
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,439
that CT actually resolves that issue

226
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,089
it's arguably it's an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

227
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:53,610
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> our inability</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to effectively</font>

228
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:54,720
revoke but there's just like so many

229
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,339
different moving parts that it makes it

230
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,290
very difficult to come in and say yes

231
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:59,670
this is good because the arguments are

232
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,719
like well this there's other pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

233
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,949
are associated with it that aren't

234
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,180
actually maybe necessarily appropriate

235
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:05,550
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know I didn't know how to</font>

236
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,979
resolve any of yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean basically i</font>

237
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:11,029
think the right way to break this down

238
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,500
is to delete all previous state

239
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:15,509
completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> i take a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the current</font>

240
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,189
document take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at David's response</font>

241
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:20,279
to the current document and don't look

242
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:27,509
at anything prior to that that make

243
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:29,790
sense I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes sense although</font>

244
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:31,130
there may be multiple replies I think

245
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,420
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and forth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set of replies</font>

246
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:36,000
David's post tend to be pretty

247
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,490
self-contained yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah you can only</font>

248
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,759
read the David's latest reply and the

249
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,050
art the draft text those two bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

250
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,300
text should be the only thing you need

251
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:46,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay but there's still the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean in</font>

252
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,508
David's reply I believe there is also

253
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:50,399
still a set of questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that aren't</font>

254
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:51,959
about whether the duel CA attack is

255
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,220
sufficiently described it's also about

256
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:56,069
whether there's additional text that

257
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,079
isn't about me ray so feel free to

258
00:11:56,069 --> 00:12:02,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">ignore that part for your review</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

259
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:08,579
dog the text of the degrassi<font color="#CCCCCC"> i type r</font>

260
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:11,639
it's all talk my um as those if you look

261
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:14,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">at recent chromium and mozilla mailing</font>

262
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:16,889
security mailing lists you know what is

263
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:19,139
two different cas is pretty much like

264
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:21,360
what's an np-hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of problem to</font>

265
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:23,759
solve these days so I think describing

266
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,490
the attack we can't do it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

267
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,470
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can't determine if this CA is</font>

268
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,089
actually different under different

269
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:33,829
administrative control than the other CA

270
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:33,829
and the MOOC last call

271
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,790
this is dkg<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not actually sure that</font>

272
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:49,110
administered control is relevant to the

273
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:51,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">doula CA attack right I mean I the dual</font>

274
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:55,170
see attack is that there's two different

275
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:56,550
particular public keys that are

276
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,779
associated with two different cas

277
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,670
whether they're administratively

278
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:09,450
different or not is irrelevant to the

279
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:10,920
particular attack right right for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

280
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,450
so you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying that the attack is</font>

281
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,550
actually much more relevant today simply

282
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:25,709
because there are multiple things that

283
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:30,349
are under control of one party yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

284
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:30,349
