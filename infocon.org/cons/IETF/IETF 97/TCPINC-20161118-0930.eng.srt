2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:24,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is the tcp ink working</font>

3
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:28,919
group congratulations on surviving IETF

4
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:32,189
all the way to Friday here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the note</font>

5
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:34,860
well it applies<font color="#CCCCCC"> to everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

6
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:39,960
said said done posted cetera in this

7
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:47,370
meeting or in the working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:48,960
Carl to be yeah yes so time for agenda

9
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:56,129
bashing does<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone have anything to add</font>

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:57,540
here yeah so chair update in case P you

11
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,850
know tcp crypt and then i'll be talking

12
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:03,120
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end about some of the messages</font>

13
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:06,030
that the chairs sent to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> FRG and by</font>

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,079
chairs<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean that i sent to jerky yeah</font>

15
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:14,340
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided may give his problem excellent</font>

16
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:16,678
he was surprised<font color="#CCCCCC"> hit cooperative so</font>

17
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,420
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> Berlin there hasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been a huge</font>

18
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:21,869
amount of work but there were two very

19
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,670
long discussions on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mailing list the</font>

20
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:27,450
those two discussions one of them was

21
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:30,749
around the urge and thin bits and the

22
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,569
other one was around a sin data and both

23
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:37,490
involved long drawn-out discussions with

24
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:40,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">Joe and some other folks that actually</font>

25
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:43,350
were produced some very subtle semantic

26
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,469
changes in the documents but I think

27
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:49,229
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> result of that the last</font>

28
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:53,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">remaining real blockers to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work group</font>

29
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:55,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call have been resolved yeah this</font>

30
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">is this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the 99 yahoo a project</font>

31
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:59,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">manager</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was striking again you know</font>

32
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,779
first time several times in a time last

33
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:05,669
ten percent takes the other ninety

34
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:07,229
percent speaking of<font color="#CCCCCC"> which yes we're at</font>

35
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,759
receiving probably post very close to

36
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,990
our milestones unlike a number of other

37
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,569
working groups including one a tight

38
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,730
ship yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will point out however</font>

39
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,290
that's sticking close to the milestones

40
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,440
in this case means that we push the

41
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:23,269
milestones back I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> three times</font>

42
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:25,250
these these dates are not the original

43
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,740
dates yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think i'm gonna make</font>

44
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">January day with the API we need me to</font>

45
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:33,590
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what we're going to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

46
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,460
that api doc late plate later in this

47
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,290
meeting yes actually that's a good

48
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">question do we want to add a specific</font>

49
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:46,030
agenda item for discussing the api doc

50
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:49,369
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> so why don't we do that after i</font>

51
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:51,080
want to put mine last just to maximize

52
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,650
the potential for TLS people to be in

53
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,440
the room so why don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we put it third so</font>

54
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,180
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP Krypton okay this quick check</font>

55
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:09,109
Aaron you still willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take notes</font>

56
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:10,910
for us um we've basically sorry that

57
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:15,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to win + lock into the</font>

58
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:17,870
agenda to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> here sorry where's</font>

59
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:21,650
genda we decided that down under<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

60
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:23,300
mic know we're after<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP crypt before CF</font>

61
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:32,930
Archie question<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we're going to talk</font>

62
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:34,370
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> api doc yes now after TCP</font>

63
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,650
crypt the first on the second column

64
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,800
yeah tcp you know then teach me crypt

65
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:44,000
then api doc and see if<font color="#CCCCCC"> RG questions</font>

66
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:52,400
than anything else thank you anybody in

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:54,970
the jabber room<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so anyone willing to</font>

68
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,970
the scribe

69
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:03,310
ok we have a volunteer thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay oh</font>

70
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,930
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> naps again I upon the work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

71
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:15,079
group with with with Pete with with with

72
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:17,450
nats not sure what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna do about</font>

73
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,980
do about about middle box probing let's

74
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,029
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the api doc let me</font>

75
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,200
figure out what we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a</font>

76
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,030
middle middle box program well

77
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,670
thankfully it's not a milestone so yeah

78
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:30,440
that's wise decision up here are that

79
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:32,210
one okay so yeah and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is almost</font>

80
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,610
copied verbatim from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

81
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,710
presentation we still we we haven't

82
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,890
gotten any bites yet on independent

83
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,539
implementation so so I implore<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if</font>

84
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:44,719
you have any interest in this please

85
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:47,690
contact one of us and we will direct you

86
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:57,280
toward resources to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you started all</font>

87
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:57,280
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so and I minute here see what</font>

88
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:17,349
we want the enos slides right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

89
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:17,349
just see if this works it does charge

90
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:33,020
okay ah great so yeah update on<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP you</font>

91
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,700
know went through a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of drafts</font>

92
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:38,000
right off the last meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then a</font>

93
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:42,530
couple more recently so just to remind

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,930
everybody of how you know works and what

95
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:47,479
the goals are you know the goal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

96
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,040
facilitate adoption of future<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

97
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,630
encryption protocols so we used to call

98
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,480
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things encryption specs we've now</font>

99
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:57,890
coined the term tap for a tcp encryption

100
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:59,900
protocol and so the idea is that we when

101
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,580
there are going to be new taps because

102
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,929
we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to like try to be all</font>

103
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,210
things to all people and solve all

104
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,230
problems and when you taps come along we

105
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,510
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want them to have to go through</font>

106
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,130
the trouble of getting a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp option</font>

107
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,500
kind because those are limited and it's

108
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,400
a pain to get them we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font>

109
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,960
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be incrementally</font>

110
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,239
deployable so you can fall back to

111
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">existing ones and possibly more</font>

112
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,960
importantly once we get this stuff

113
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:25,159
deployed there may be applications that

114
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,599
then take advantage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP ink and we</font>

115
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,400
want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that those</font>

116
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,140
applications continue to be forward

117
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,760
compatible with future taps if you

118
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,460
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through the trouble of</font>

119
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,229
integrating the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP the session ID for</font>

120
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,250
example in your user authentication you

121
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,710
want to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that works with</font>

122
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,180
the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> tab taps so the goal of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ino</font>

123
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:45,229
is to kind of abstract all these things

124
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:47,540
away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the application and uh and so</font>

125
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:49,430
we also want to you know minimize

126
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,680
consumption option space since that's at

127
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:55,100
a premium and avoid unnecessary round

128
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,540
trips and you know of course because

129
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,860
this is has to be backwards how do we

130
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,600
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure we fall back to</font>

131
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,910
unencrypt the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp rather than causing</font>

132
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,820
connections to fail as much as possible

133
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,500
so just an overview of how it works in

134
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,390
the common case of a three-way handshake

135
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,870
you have an active opener we sent the

136
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:15,260
sin segment and the sin segment contains

137
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:17,750
a an e no option and inside that<font color="#CCCCCC"> II</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

138
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,849
option is a list of type identifier

139
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,169
saying you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> TTP level</font>

140
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,919
encryption protocols are supported by

141
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:28,430
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> accubow then the the passive opener</font>

142
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:30,729
replies of the syn<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACK and replies with</font>

143
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,729
a

144
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:42,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kristen try try it again there you go</font>

145
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:44,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">good and so replies with ideally the one</font>

146
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,840
tap<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that the act that the pass</font>

147
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,940
opener wants there's also this new

148
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,359
change we made last<font color="#CCCCCC"> time where you have</font>

149
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:55,490
to add this this this be bit here to say

150
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,139
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> passive opener and that</font>

151
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,599
was in a way you know I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

152
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:01,340
say it's nice to have middleboxes doing

153
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,750
horrible things but we didn't have kind

154
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like all these debates about should</font>

155
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,960
we have this like<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfectly symmetric</font>

156
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:07,280
protocol whatever and all that turned

157
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,169
out to the irrelevant because we found

158
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">out the places like Baidu just like have</font>

159
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:14,780
these these middleboxes that like echo

160
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,520
any unknown<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP options back to the</font>

161
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,409
opener and so it just had to be the case

162
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,840
if somebody echoes your option that it

163
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:22,159
just you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> is disabled because it</font>

164
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,869
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be disastrous to start encrypting</font>

165
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:26,810
when the other side didn't know that it

166
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,789
was encrypting so basically one side has

167
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,319
to set the Biba 20 the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other side has to</font>

168
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:32,510
set the<font color="#E5E5E5"> be bit to one otherwise we fall</font>

169
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,320
back unencrypted<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP and that just makes</font>

170
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:38,270
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things simpler and then you in</font>

171
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,890
the third leg of the handshake keep

172
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,689
sending<font color="#CCCCCC"> the e no option to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make clear</font>

173
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know didn't</font>

174
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,850
get stripped off the syn ACK segment and

175
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:50,540
you keep sending<font color="#CCCCCC"> a no option until such</font>

176
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:53,240
point as you you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> received a segment</font>

177
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,160
that doesn't contain<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sin flag and at</font>

178
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,600
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point you know you're done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and both</font>

179
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,449
sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that they're encrypting and</font>

180
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,279
the connection is encrypted if any of

181
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,510
the e knows our options are missing the

182
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,370
beginning then you fall back to

183
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:08,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">unencrypted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP and also gives us the</font>

184
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:09,829
backwards compatibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what's a</font>

185
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,170
nanny no option Willis two kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

186
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:13,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> options or two forms of you know</font>

187
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">options there's the ones that are in sin</font>

188
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,660
segments and the ones that are nonsense

189
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,399
segments so at the top you see in a sin

190
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:22,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">segment the e no options they say</font>

192
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,050
otherwise it's just ignored right just

193
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,180
the presence<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the you know option is a</font>

that you should put some bytes in there

198
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,740
it must be<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero bytes so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just an</font>

199
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:42,790
empty option but it's available if the

200
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:46,300
pep wants it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

201
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:48,579
within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sin segments each sub-option</font>

202
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,490
starts with an initial sub-option bite

203
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:53,590
and that bite has two components it has

204
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,870
this high bit v which stands for

205
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:57,730
variable like data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then has a 7-bit</font>

206
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,740
thing that used to be called CS but now

207
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,080
we're calling it<font color="#E5E5E5"> g LT which stands for</font>

208
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:05,110
global sub-option length ortep

209
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">identifier and we've sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of broken it</font>

210
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:11,110
up into four quadrants when the GLT

211
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:13,300
field is less than 32 then if<font color="#CCCCCC"> v is 0</font>

212
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,890
it's what we call a global sub-option

213
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,260
music all that a general sub-option<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

214
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:20,920
the name global it's clear these other

215
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:23,380
options of by across all taps and and if

216
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,849
it's one then it's a length bite and

217
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,350
reset this more complicated thing with

218
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,690
length words whatever we just got<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of</font>

219
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:32,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that now it's simpler and then</font>

220
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:34,810
for values<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 32 or greater it's a temp</font>

221
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:37,330
identifier that seven value is a temp

222
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:39,609
identifier and if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> V bit is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

223
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:42,640
just a one-bite<font color="#CCCCCC"> kept otherwise oh it has</font>

224
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:44,260
variable length data so in one more

225
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,810
detail there's basically three kinds of

226
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:51,010
tap<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifiers that you can embed</font>

227
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:52,780
inside a sin for me no option you have

228
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">the single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> byte happened under fire that</font>

229
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,990
doesn't have any data just as hey I

230
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,990
support this tcp encryption protocol

231
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:03,939
sorry my popping my PS or am I am I not

232
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:06,340
louder with oh yeah sorry because I

233
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,320
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have my slides in front of me so</font>

234
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,700
I'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I'll try to speak across the</font>

235
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,350
mic like this actually I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

236
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:15,000
speak usually when you speak into a mic

237
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:18,640
you pop your P's better talk across but

238
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so uh so yeah so here's the one bite</font>

239
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,000
when when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> V bit is 0</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise</font>

240
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,590
there's two options if you just set the

241
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">V bit to one and you set a type</font>

242
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:28,240
identifier which is where the low<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 bits</font>

243
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,580
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3qr higher then it means that the</font>

244
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,200
data extends to the end of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp</font>

245
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,760
option and we special<font color="#E5E5E5"> case this because</font>

246
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,140
we think the common cases there's only

247
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,700
going to be one<font color="#E5E5E5"> tap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually has</font>

248
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:41,439
data just cuz you don't have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

249
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:43,120
bytes inside us in header and then the

250
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,850
other option is that you have this link

251
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,560
bite and then you have a temp ID with

252
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the veba set one and then you have that</font>

253
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">many bytes of data so that way you can</font>

254
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:56,600
actually if you want have multiple taps

255
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:58,069
of options<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have data and then</font>

256
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,980
the other option is this global

257
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:04,219
sub-option the global sub-option starts

258
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:07,579
with 30 bits and then has three<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reserve</font>

259
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:09,380
bits that must be<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then uh then</font>

260
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:11,269
these two bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> ambi so a little bit be</font>

261
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the thing that breaks the</font>

262
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:14,420
symmetry of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocol the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Pasig</font>

263
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:16,399
opener always has to set be equal to 1

264
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,709
the active opener always has to set be

265
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,480
equal to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 although 0 is the default</font>

266
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:23,689
value<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the active opener happens to</font>

267
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,279
admit this this global sub-option that's

268
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:27,139
because like in the very first sin

269
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:31,040
packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one up you know option</font>

270
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:32,630
spaces at the greatest premium and then

271
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,969
the second thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> application of</font>

272
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:36,380
where bit which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a bit that's</font>

273
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,050
available to the application to

274
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:43,160
negotiate something out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of band that</font>

275
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:44,810
triggers authentication of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP level</font>

276
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,730
encryption right so that's how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

277
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:49,160
some legacy protocol there's no way to

278
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,690
add like a you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a start TLS command</font>

279
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,399
to it it's are the protocols already

280
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,779
fixed but now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this extra bit</font>

281
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,029
that says hey when we do our

282
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:58,579
authentication step if both of us agree

283
00:12:56,029 --> 00:13:00,470
that we're aware of<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP you know will</font>

284
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:03,589
you know somehow incorporate the session

285
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,970
ID and how we do application if you

286
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:07,579
remember last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I used to be this M</font>

287
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,170
bit uh you know we decided to push us

288
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:11,739
that offer later we still think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

289
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:14,029
there's room for application independent

290
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,100
authentication protocols and that we

291
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:17,959
should negotiate those out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of band but</font>

292
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,670
we now have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these three bits named Z 3 Z</font>

293
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:21,859
2 n.c one that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use so ideally</font>

294
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">xiii you know at some future draft will</font>

295
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,610
become a you know and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> separate</font>

296
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:28,130
document would say like how<font color="#E5E5E5"> could you</font>

297
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:31,399
combine<font color="#E5E5E5"> dane and tcp you know for</font>

298
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:32,990
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only allowed to</font>

299
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:35,209
have one global sub-option you have to

300
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,860
ignore subsequent ones that means if

301
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:38,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">five bits turns out not to be enough we</font>

302
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">could just say when you get a second</font>

303
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:42,110
sub-option it has these five new bits

304
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,609
that have five new meaning so probably

305
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:47,959
what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> but at least we're future</font>

306
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:50,689
compatible if you'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so now the</font>

307
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:52,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">the interesting stuff so this is</font>

308
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:54,829
probably the biggest change since last

309
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,839
time and we had a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> special</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Manila</font>

310
00:13:54,829 --> 00:13:59,599
I hope that where we ended up made

311
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:03,439
everyone happy and that is we talked

312
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:07,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what does it mean to you to for a</font>

313
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:09,980
tap to embed data inside a a sense

314
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:13,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">segment to do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like you know</font>

315
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:16,160
tcp fast open for example so uh so

316
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:18,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple things so first of all we said</font>

317
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,230
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you have a sin segment with an</font>

318
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:24,319
e no option the last type identifier in

319
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:26,870
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP option is what we're</font>

320
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,360
calling the sin tab and thus in tap is

321
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:32,510
responsible for defining the meaning of

322
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,750
data that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside that's inside that</font>

323
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:37,700
that's in<font color="#CCCCCC"> segments so in particular if</font>

324
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,470
the sin<font color="#E5E5E5"> tab doesn't say anything about</font>

325
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,420
sin data then you are not allowed to put

326
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,010
data in a sin segment right but we're

327
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,740
leaving<font color="#E5E5E5"> the option open for future taps</font>

328
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:49,010
that that might wish to do this right<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

329
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:51,350
and then of course the symptom i turn

330
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:53,240
out not to be the negotiated tap right

331
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,250
you might propose a bunch of peps the

332
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,360
last one is one thing you embed a bunch

333
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">of data for that and it turns out that</font>

334
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,600
you know you're the active open of the

335
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">passive opener decides to choose a</font>

336
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,500
different one<font color="#E5E5E5"> so at that point you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

337
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:06,080
to discard the data because it doesn't

338
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,550
because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data only had meaning</font>

339
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,010
to one particular tap and you chose a

340
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:14,630
different tab so we say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font>

341
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:16,340
discard the sin data if the sin tap is

342
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,140
not the negotiated that including the

343
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:23,840
case where<font color="#CCCCCC"> ino fails entirely and it's</font>

344
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:25,220
not an encrypted connection and we also

345
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,860
say they have to discard the data if

346
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,660
there's any<font color="#E5E5E5"> off any other tcp option</font>

347
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,360
that implies something about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meaning</font>

348
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,040
of the sin data so right now the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

349
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,530
that's most relevant btfo so if you have

350
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,719
a non-empty TFO option you just you have

351
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:40,430
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> discard the sin data basically it's</font>

352
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,930
it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't make sense because if</font>

353
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,819
you have the TFO option telling you hey

354
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:46,430
this is some plain text application data

355
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:50,420
and you have say a sin<font color="#E5E5E5"> tap telling you</font>

356
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:52,010
like hey this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> um you know some part</font>

357
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a key exchange or something then like</font>

358
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:56,120
that which is it right you don't know so

359
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:59,959
so you know you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to use</font>

360
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,460
TFO in conjunction with this so that's

361
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,800
one safeguard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can't use the</font>

362
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,260
data if it's unah if it's ambiguous what

363
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,170
it means the second safeguard is what

364
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:11,090
happens if uh there's a host<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

365
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:12,709
know receives its data and appears to

366
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:16,130
discard it because doesn't actually act

367
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:18,560
the bytes that were in the ascendant but

368
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,540
it actually caches those bites anyway

369
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,640
and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you re transmit the those</font>

370
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,930
sequence numbers with different bites it

371
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">uses the cash</font>

372
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,189
original version of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and because we</font>

373
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:31,550
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP implementations</font>

374
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:33,110
don't do that we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we require you</font>

375
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,310
to do it if you implement you know but

376
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,779
of course the other side might not

377
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:41,149
implement you know so what that means is

378
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:45,649
that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UH so that means is</font>

379
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:47,360
basically if the other side<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're if</font>

380
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:50,149
the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> side doesn't appear to support</font>

381
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,440
you know and it is required<font color="#CCCCCC"> to drop</font>

382
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:53,180
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> bites</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you actually have to</font>

383
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,740
abort<font color="#E5E5E5"> the connection and you know send a</font>

384
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:59,120
reset right and so so what that means is

385
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,770
of course you don't want gratuitous

386
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,050
resets so that means you should avoid

387
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">sinner only data by default so we're</font>

388
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,659
saying we're leaving the<font color="#E5E5E5"> door open for</font>

389
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:07,520
this in the future but we're saying it

390
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,530
you know it shouldn't be enabled by

391
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,809
default so either there should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mode</font>

392
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:13,639
where you don't use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that or if your tap</font>

393
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:15,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">always uses that and not have shouldn't</font>

394
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,500
be on by default but we're suggesting

395
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,949
that the API might contain a flag that

396
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:26,059
says you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I know that TCP II know is</font>

397
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:27,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be enabled so just reset the</font>

398
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:29,660
connection i'm only interested in

399
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:32,210
talking over and a temp encrypted

400
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,620
connection and if if the application is

401
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,179
actually asking you to reset an

402
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,879
unencrypted connection anyway you know

403
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:39,050
then it's fine to use these and you're

404
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

405
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:42,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">for web browsing or something but might</font>

406
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,730
make sense for like NFS or something

407
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,809
where it's like you're on a land you

408
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,100
know they're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a server that</font>

409
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:48,620
supports this you might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just</font>

410
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,699
configure yourself to always require the

411
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,469
encryption and then you can save

412
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:56,420
yourself a half a round trip basically

413
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:59,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so that's the one big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change and</font>

414
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:03,350
then the this looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a</font>

415
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,700
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I looked up</font>

416
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,870
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft and I didn't find it so</font>

417
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is only for session resumption</font>

418
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:10,879
right no no this is for this is not for

419
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:13,250
session resumption this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

420
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually at the inn II know it's not a</font>

421
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP crib so it's kind of we're not</font>

422
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,370
actually using it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP grip but this</font>

423
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,740
is to leave the<font color="#E5E5E5"> door open for future</font>

424
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:24,949
taps that<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to subsume some TFO like</font>

425
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:27,440
functionality and what we're saying is

426
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:30,710
it's fine if you want to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but it</font>

427
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,630
has to be off by default and uh and

428
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,980
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to reset the</font>

429
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,570
connection if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk if the remote</font>

430
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,380
site doesn't support you know and you

431
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">sent it a bunch of</font>

432
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,590
protects your key exchange stuff that it

433
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,300
probably doesn't understand therefore

434
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,310
and therefore you'll have to reset the

435
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,250
connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

436
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:50,280
actually application data you put in the

437
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:54,000
payload its data you need for it I mean

438
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:56,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is up its up to the it's up to the</font>

439
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,460
debt tap the specific tab and and right

440
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:01,350
now no taps actually do this but I could

441
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,300
one could imagine that it would be like

442
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,100
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did this for TCP crypt it would be</font>

443
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,090
one a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in the case of session</font>

444
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,669
resumption it would be encrypted

445
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,230
application data and in the case of like

446
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,120
a fresh connection it would be key

447
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:20,070
exchange data or you know symmetric

448
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:23,159
cipher preferences or both<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the</font>

449
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:25,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">the second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is in either berliner</font>

450
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">argentina there it's been at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and</font>

451
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:31,830
long<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough that starting to blur but we</font>

452
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,659
became we became forcefully convinced

453
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,939
that in under no circumstances doing

454
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:40,710
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp you know to be like required to</font>

455
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:42,180
modify RFC 793 and so there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

456
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,680
problem that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were saying things like</font>

457
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,840
well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you can have some</font>

458
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,450
mechanism for end the file that's

459
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,610
separate from fin and and the language

460
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:53,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of made it sound like maybe the fin</font>

461
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:56,760
bit was no longer the fin bit and so I

462
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:59,730
so and same for urge and so instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

463
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,680
we've done is we've rewritten these tap

464
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,830
requirements to make everything in terms

465
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like authenticating the existing TCP</font>

466
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,429
mechanism so we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> abandoning TCP</font>

467
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,709
mechanisms right so particularly say

468
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:13,920
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know taps have to authenticate</font>

469
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,390
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fin bit and you know they can do</font>

470
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,980
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some parallel mechanism but if</font>

471
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,180
the parallel mechanism the fin bit don't

472
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,710
match them that means you've got some

473
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,480
packet<font color="#CCCCCC"> corruption</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there you can</font>

474
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,640
discard the segment that's corrupted or

475
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,710
reset the connection with an error or

476
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:30,090
something but you can't treat<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like an</font>

477
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:31,350
authentic and<font color="#CCCCCC"> defiled and similarly so</font>

478
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,699
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is where things get a</font>

479
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:36,870
little tricky we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of walk</font>

480
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:39,750
this fine line with with urgent data

481
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:41,939
that it is part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP but a lot of</font>

482
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,160
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't use it but like if people</font>

483
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,350
could inject urgent data it could like

484
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,950
mess up existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> applications so we want</font>

485
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:51,179
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear that you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a temp</font>

486
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,310
cannot cause urgent data

487
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,230
to be delivered when none has been sent

488
00:20:53,310 --> 00:21:00,090
by the sender that's really like the

489
00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:02,340
important thing and uh the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

490
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:05,760
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way in hell that TCP</font>

491
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:08,760
use TLS is going to support urgent data

492
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,640
properly<font color="#CCCCCC"> look exactly the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way uh TCP</font>

493
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,850
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP crip does but but it'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be hard</font>

494
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,840
to fit<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP use TLS and so we want</font>

495
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do is make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you know can</font>

496
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,580
accommodate TCP use TLS but not that

497
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,500
we're like modifying RFC 793 in

498
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,679
particular you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this more</font>

499
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,930
recent RFC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 69 degree that kind of</font>

500
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:30,570
reaffirms urgent data and talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

501
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,190
how it's supposed to how supposed to

502
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:34,409
work so we have this thing you know it's

503
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:37,320
maybe theoretically used by some really

504
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:40,260
old FTP servers and and maybe telnet<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

505
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:43,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">rsh which people aren't using that much</font>

506
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:46,050
anymore it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not used by most</font>

507
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,300
applications so basically what we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

508
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:51,180
we left<font color="#E5E5E5"> this loophole that we hope is</font>

509
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:53,450
big enough to fit like TCP use TLS

510
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:57,360
through so we're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that basically</font>

511
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know it's okay to you you might have</font>

512
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,020
some taps<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would just basically</font>

513
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:04,679
ignore the urgent flag pretend it's

514
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:06,150
clear no matter what and but you

515
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,880
shouldn't enable that kind of tap by

516
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:10,890
default except when you know for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fact</font>

517
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the application is not going to use</font>

518
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,730
urgent data and like it just happens

519
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:16,139
that we know for a fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> that almost all</font>

520
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,840
applications are not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use urgent</font>

521
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,780
data so so that's our hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the</font>

522
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,129
week minutes a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thread the needle</font>

523
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:26,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay let me say one quick thing about</font>

524
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:28,530
threading the needle it's basically

525
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,360
another way to think about the phrase

526
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,180
everything in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of technique TCP</font>

527
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,729
functionality from a functional point of

528
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:39,330
view one way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about what's going</font>

529
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:42,740
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> with uh with the temps is that you've</font>

530
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:45,720
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> crypto function between the TCP</font>

531
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:48,900
implementation and the wire which means

532
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,880
on receipt you get to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> do the decrypt</font>

533
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,500
look at what the temp put in there to

534
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell you where the thin bit is authentic</font>

535
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:59,070
or not and if the TCP header contained a

536
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:01,470
thin bit but the decrypted a tech

537
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,409
payload said no Finn bit here at that

538
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">point you discarded the regular TV</font>

539
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:06,900
implementation never see

540
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">is it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if all else</font>

541
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,220
fails we will we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> phrase this in</font>

542
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,340
terms of processing sequence where you

543
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:17,850
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP and then do the encryption and</font>

544
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,620
on the on on<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending on receipt you do</font>

545
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:21,899
it in reverse order and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we</font>

546
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:32,219
can be be confident<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not going</font>

547
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:34,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to need to update RFC 793 okay so so</font>

548
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,360
yeah so these are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only two</font>

549
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:38,070
big changes this is kind of summary of

550
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,620
everything we've changed I've got these

551
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:42,720
new terminology that specs are now

552
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,129
called taps the general sub drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> shin</font>

553
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,130
became the global sub-option we've got

554
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:49,770
this notion of a sin tap we get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

555
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:53,580
the length word so now the other than

556
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:56,250
the last tap sub-option you can only

557
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:58,350
have 32 bytes of sub-option data but

558
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,960
remember the total space for all options

559
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:03,179
is 40 bytes<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's not you're not</font>

560
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to have more than one sub option</font>

561
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:07,560
that's more than 3 q bytes anyway so

562
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,720
again let's just simplifies things we

563
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:12,030
got rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the n-bit called the reserve</font>

564
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,040
bitsy<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones QV</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> c 3 to make it easier to</font>

565
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:18,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">name and future drafts that might use</font>

566
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:21,600
them we talked about data and since

568
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,750
changed some shoulds to musts and for

569
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,430
the remaining shoulds we tried for

570
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:31,680
everyone that way actually say like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

571
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,300
exception is whatever because basically

572
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,470
have pushed back on the mailing list you

573
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,480
shouldn't just blindly throw around

574
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:38,040
shoulds if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if you're saying</font>

575
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,630
should instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> must because it's an</font>

00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,909
exception like explicitly state with the

577
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:45,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">exception so we try to be clear about</font>

578
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:46,440
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we tried to</font>

579
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,760
improve the wording for the temp

580
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,920
requirements already talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

581
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">pin and urge the other thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

582
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,210
I'm sorry I forget who did this<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

583
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:56,850
brought up the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> of forward secrecy</font>

584
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:59,190
on the mailing list and saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

585
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:01,590
know basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we didn't want to rule</font>

586
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,480
out some application some possible

587
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:06,659
implementations right you could you know

588
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,700
imagine an application where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

589
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:11,040
like seed<font color="#E5E5E5"> your system random generator</font>

590
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,450
from some seed file but stored on an SSD

591
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,090
and you know because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your flash</font>

592
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:16,470
translation layer like we technically

593
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:18,418
it's like really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to do forward</font>

594
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,100
secrecy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of</font>

595
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:22,019
scenario but the important thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

596
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,969
want the at the protocol level all the

597
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:25,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">tests offer forward secrecy so basically</font>

598
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:28,679
we're saying like you can't depend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

599
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:33,508
long-lived secrets Percy on long live

600
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:36,600
keys for secrecy and uh and and yeah and

601
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:40,259
that's it so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few tiny things left</font>

602
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:43,109
to do I hope so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> one question</font>

603
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:44,940
that still have I don't think discussed

604
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:48,090
this before but should there be a way to

605
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:51,960
signify that like a host implements<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ino</font>

606
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:53,549
but it's just disabled and one reason

607
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,409
you might want this is because it would

608
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:59,309
help in the case of in that corner case

609
00:25:55,409 --> 00:26:00,960
where you have to discard some sin data

610
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:02,489
that's like because there's a sin tap

611
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,389
ended up not governing the connection

612
00:26:02,489 --> 00:26:05,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">well if you know the other side</font>

613
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:07,469
implements you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though it's not</font>

614
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,658
enabled you know it will discard that

615
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:11,759
data so that might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice it might also</font>

616
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:13,739
be useful in terms of like data

617
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,359
gathering to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to you know people</font>

618
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,559
well advertised hey like my kernel

619
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,418
supports I just haven't turned it on yet

620
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,009
then that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could help make the argument</font>

621
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:22,859
that people should eventually turn it on

622
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:24,059
because like it's at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the code</font>

623
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:28,168
is out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it just needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

624
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:30,600
configured another thing I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

625
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:32,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">just an omission but we should have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

626
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,320
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the API document some kind of</font>

627
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:36,840
TCP you know mandatory thing that says

628
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,230
hey abort the connection if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't uh</font>

629
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,449
if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not encrypted and that that</font>

630
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:44,759
option would allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to enable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taps</font>

631
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:47,549
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Duty fo like things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

632
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:49,619
sinned data you know then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to get</font>

633
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:52,549
get our actual option still hoping we

634
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:56,399
get 69 since we had used that earlier um

635
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:58,440
and yeah I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> not much else there's</font>

636
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:01,139
other stuff kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fond work so we</font>

637
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">still need TCP you know middle box</font>

638
00:27:01,139 --> 00:27:05,549
probing document there's this

639
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,879
experimental spec ID so we'll need

640
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:10,379
another drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talks about how to</font>

641
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:11,820
multiplex that and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think some exi d</font>

642
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:18,480
like thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that should be very</font>

643
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:20,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple and then uh yeah ideal it also</font>

644
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,460
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you know see application</font>

645
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,590
independent middleware authentication so

646
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,509
that you can like load a shared library

647
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:30,599
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know when Dane is deployed or</font>

648
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:32,039
whatever it can actually do like server

649
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:33,658
authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> and transport</font>

650
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:35,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">application so this is different from</font>

651
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:37,559
the a bit and that it would say like

652
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:40,409
here's a little mini protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

653
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:42,809
can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of handing the socket over</font>

654
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:44,970
to the application but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again we've got</font>

655
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:47,759
three bits and we could co-opt one of

656
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:49,139
those bits for doing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay few</font>

657
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,239
suggestions from up here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll go</font>

658
00:27:49,139 --> 00:27:55,889
bottom the top since that seems we seem

659
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:58,169
that stack a life<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you way my brain is</font>

660
00:27:55,889 --> 00:27:59,879
working this morning application

661
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:02,639
independent authentication would be a

662
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:05,449
fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow-on I would strongly suggest</font>

663
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:07,469
writing the draft against a specific

664
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,700
mechanism as opposed to writing a

665
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,769
general drive so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could do this</font>

666
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,799
figure out how to use Dane<font color="#E5E5E5"> and bright</font>

667
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:15,149
then write<font color="#CCCCCC"> down the details yeah that's</font>

668
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:18,179
that's why we're not that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why it's not</font>

669
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:20,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of it you know a good we want to do</font>

670
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:22,619
you have any experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the a bit</font>

671
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:26,340
for application awareness in the

672
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:28,379
prototyping<font color="#E5E5E5"> he done um yeah andreia did</font>

673
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,389
it was it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while ago right didn't</font>

674
00:28:28,379 --> 00:28:37,799
we use it in the original tale tell us

675
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:40,019
yeah trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to the mic here if any</font>

676
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:42,090
was listening or Muttley but uh there's

677
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:44,809
I've got two<font color="#E5E5E5"> people on me dekho so yes</font>

678
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,809
please use the mic

679
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,899
yeah so there's an address so the

680
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,820
question was whether we use da<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit in</font>

681
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:59,090
our prototyping and we certainly did we

682
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:01,970
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop-in replacement for lib ssl a</font>

683
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:04,970
binary for placement actually and the

684
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:09,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea was to use the a bit if the other</font>

685
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:11,990
end<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> supported</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP crypt we just</font>

686
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,400
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of use TCP crypt and then do the</font>

687
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:16,730
authentication ourselves we get the

688
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:19,669
session ID<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh using a cell and if it</font>

689
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:22,640
didn't support the a bit we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just did</font>

690
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:24,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">vanilla TLS basically reason the</font>

691
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,570
question was to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask whether</font>

692
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">implementation experience with the a bit</font>

693
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,750
to figure out what it actually works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

694
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:31,129
sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like yes yeah those guys and</font>

695
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:34,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good idea there's a slightly</font>

696
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:36,890
older version of TCP grip but I mean the

697
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:38,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">rest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same level as</font>

698
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:40,190
opposed to the end of it which is

699
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:43,039
something something will come back to

700
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:47,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">later okay working our way up dedicated</font>

701
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:49,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP option um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i suspect i spec</font>

702
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:51,070
house gonna make me go<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sydney a shepherd</font>

703
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,480
for this draft in part because this one

704
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:57,230
well I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Shepherd for</font>

705
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:59,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">the stress yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay game plan here we</font>

706
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:01,309
get through worker blast call first and

707
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,020
then we will at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point with it or do</font>

708
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:07,309
I believe the rough consensus of this

709
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:10,010
working group is to ask for 69 however I

710
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:11,960
don't even have I would ask Joe touch to

711
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:13,100
do a working-class core of you I suspect

712
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,630
that request is not going to be

713
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:19,399
necessary<font color="#CCCCCC"> now but let's be serious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe</font>

714
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,409
is one of the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who has the best</font>

715
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:23,360
understanding and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most scars from</font>

716
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:25,279
fighting TCP option so having them do

717
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,529
the technical review during a vesicle is

718
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:31,070
very good and as part of that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

719
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:34,250
go deal with a which option number and

720
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:36,080
uh and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what 69 decide whenever any</font>

721
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,370
options fine well I understanding

722
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,110
options fine however i'm pretty sure

723
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:42,590
based on discussion I think in<font color="#CCCCCC"> berlin</font>

724
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:45,168
yes um 16 not that the rough consensus

725
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:47,299
is this working group is to reuse 69 and

726
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:48,740
we can then<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an argument it's where</font>

727
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:49,970
the work group is working group is right

728
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,350
or wrong about that but we will have

729
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,750
that argument on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list yeah I believe</font>

730
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">the the the philosophy behind that was</font>

731
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,500
you broke it you bought it kind of thing

732
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:59,239
so which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is fine i think everybody was</font>

733
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,399
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font>

734
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,300
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i recall correctly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> joe is arguing</font>

735
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:03,500
something stronger

736
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,740
but this point I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop trying</font>

737
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:09,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">to stop trying to channel Joe finally I</font>

738
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:11,120
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking now as an individual not</font>

739
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,909
you're working group chair and not your

740
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,889
draft Shepherd and I've osteria the

741
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:20,030
gratuitous walk walk before Mike to make

742
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:23,660
the point i would suggest not doing the

743
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:27,020
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> item on this slide this is already</font>

744
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:30,410
subtle complex and unlikely to be used

745
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:32,000
let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not do anything more that we</font>

746
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:33,530
don't need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can get all</font>

747
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,840
three things so first bullet on which

748
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:37,970
part of LA the option way to signal you

749
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,520
know infinite but but disabled sounds

750
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:43,520
like you're proposing to add some some

751
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:46,460
additional functionality um to cope with

752
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,020
sin sin data which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> date we the</font>

753
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:50,330
only think use anyhow well living but

754
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:51,950
let me make this more concrete what I'm

755
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:54,679
proposing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that instead of</font>

756
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:56,840
saying you have to send one<font color="#CCCCCC"> or more pep</font>

757
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,280
IDs you could be changing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to zero or</font>

758
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">more and if there's zero then you</font>

759
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:04,720
there's no negotiated tap but it's just

760
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:08,060
it's making it legal to send basically a

761
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,070
gratuitous you know option in a sin

762
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,659
segment this is sounding like we're to

763
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:14,629
dysfunction out it isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> closer to</font>

764
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:17,240
getting the job done<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I'm gonna</font>

765
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:18,470
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start kairos not speaking as</font>

766
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,080
chair I'm gonna have to disagree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

767
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,640
with David on this actually think this

768
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,470
is a really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea for the exactly</font>

769
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">the reason you specified which is that</font>

770
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:30,380
which is that it solves the problem of

771
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:32,480
knowing whether a peer support you know

772
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:35,330
but just has it disabled for purposes of

773
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,160
dealing with early data and it doesn't

774
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:39,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">seem like it complicates the protocol in</font>

775
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,810
any way so it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it seems like a</font>

776
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:44,360
good idea if the if the client sends an

777
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:46,280
e no option then you just you always

778
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,860
respond with one if you support you know

779
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,660
whether you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have it turned on or not and</font>

780
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,459
that solves the ambiguity regarding

781
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,830
whether you have to terminate the

782
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:57,440
connection if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> send early data or not</font>

783
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:59,449
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean we older versions that like</font>

784
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,180
really old versions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP grip had some</font>

785
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:04,550
way of like declining or whatever but

786
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:06,860
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we don't feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> strongly but</font>

787
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:08,899
it's yeah you could have been yeah I

788
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,429
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't I don't see a big benefit</font>

789
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,990
of it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're anyway I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

790
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:14,120
the negotiation next time you never<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

791
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,080
what was before and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then like I'm not</font>

792
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">even sure if you want to catch this</font>

793
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,010
information

794
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:20,779
is next time try something some

795
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:22,158
different you know one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> week</font>

796
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:24,830
one thing that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like been a</font>

797
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,860
thorn in our side for the whole time is

798
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:29,750
like people talking about you know

799
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,250
whether middleboxes are gonna like strip

800
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:33,080
options and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so be</font>

801
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,779
kinda nice a like you know what like

802
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,639
okay nobody's you know most<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

803
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:39,440
using you know yet but like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> appears</font>

804
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:45,289
that it like it gets through middleboxes

805
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:46,789
but but again it's not well if the

806
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:48,289
consensus<font color="#E5E5E5"> is don't put it in then we</font>

807
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:50,210
won't put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> small change</font>

808
00:33:48,289 --> 00:33:53,389
either<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 can you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel explain how it</font>

809
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:54,740
has middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> books because if the other</font>

810
00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:56,090
end doesn't support you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

811
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,919
know anything about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle box in</font>

812
00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:01,399
between no no I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying suppose that</font>

813
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,470
like you know you know gets deployed but

814
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:05,658
just it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be off by default at</font>

815
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,679
first right and so people are going to

816
00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:09,260
want to know like well should I turn

817
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:11,119
this on and if you say like oh well it

818
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,460
does appear that like when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an e</font>

819
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,560
no option to this person on getting one

820
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:17,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the B bit set properly back and</font>

821
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,820
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're our path appears to be</font>

822
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:22,460
clear through this network then that

823
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:25,010
might encourage people to turn it on to

824
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,230
configure it on so I believe if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if</font>

825
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:29,000
you deploy the implementation and you

826
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,710
have a turn off by default what you want

827
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,149
in this case is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a traffic</font>

828
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,579
change at all and we don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

829
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:40,368
me on other also it's like it's also

830
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:42,500
options face right there are given it I

831
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:46,220
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually matters I mean</font>

832
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:47,869
talk if you if we put it there another

833
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:50,000
end it's going to ignore it anyway

834
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:52,310
because there is nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with a no</font>

835
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,489
option because there is no steps to

836
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:56,960
negotiate so the other one has to be

837
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:59,299
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ignore it anyway because and</font>

838
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,950
fall back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that clear fixed anyway so</font>

839
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:04,310
it doesn't affect it doesn't affect any

840
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:05,810
implementation if you allow it or not it

841
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">can allow it can allow you to you know</font>

842
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:11,180
to you know probing in any cases where

843
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:13,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">you for a point for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

844
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:15,770
you know measurements how many things

845
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:17,450
works and you know this without one of

846
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:19,040

848
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,960
a proposal and you get same response

849
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:25,910
regular basis you know enabled at all

850
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,710
but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> too running or if you had just</font>

851
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:29,180
available from corporations this would

00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">allow you to the propane without you</font>

853
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,940

854
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,980
caring if that don't support<font color="#CCCCCC"> CC pink or</font>

855
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:37,620
epic ripped or TLS<font color="#E5E5E5"> racer so you're in</font>

856
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,630
favor or actually I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because I</font>

857
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:41,520
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't affect the normal</font>

858
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,920
implementations without because I mean

859
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,870
yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could you just put it in there</font>

860
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,450
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know other ones just okay so you</font>

861
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:51,180
think that's okay yeah so I've got two

862
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:54,779
in favor to against count yeah Kyle rose

863
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:58,140
yeah the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two cases it helps are the</font>

864
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:01,800
probing case and the preventing spurious

865
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:04,560
resets case and I think maybe what we

866
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,780
want to do is kind of go into more

867
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,940
detail on the mailing list on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

868
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,950
the ups and you know the upsides and

869
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,500
downsides of this because myriad pointed

870
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:16,589
out some some good downsides to doing

871
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,450
this including option space and the fact

872
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,830
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know ideally you would</font>

873
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:22,439
like an implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a way to</font>

874
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:25,350
say really turn it off and don't even

875
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:28,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">send you know don't even recognize that</font>

876
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:32,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">this option exists but that adds</font>

877
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:34,140
complexity to the API so I think

878
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,940
outlining it on the mailing list and

879
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,259
then getting making a consensus call

880
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,220
there is probably the right way to do

881
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,770
that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

882
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:42,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">that everyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understands all of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

883
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:47,400
implications of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> fully before making</font>

884
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:48,900
a decision good wanna try this fairly

885
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,360
quickly on the mailing list so that we

886
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,160
can get yes anyone important is worth

887
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,350
delaying stuff but it's just one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

888
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I noticed we kind of lied it needs</font>

889
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:59,400
to be further need for fairly simple

890
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">this Martin do um so we talked a lot</font>

891
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,390
about the potential benefits or like the

892
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,160
realm of this but can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you give us a</font>

893
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:07,020
sense of costs I don't you try to

894
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,049
implement it like how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many</font>

895
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:12,480
paragraphs<font color="#CCCCCC"> of spec is it it's like it's</font>

896
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:14,700
like a changing a 120 I mean it's like

897
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,870
it's well no it's more than changing 120

898
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,939
you're also<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have to write a</font>

899
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:21,000
paragraph<font color="#E5E5E5"> that explains what happens</font>

900
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:23,970
when when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eno option shows up all</font>

901
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,680
shows up on a sin Carrie Carrie carrying

902
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:27,689
no carrying no temp a low actually

903
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,569
that's already it's already clear then

904
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:32,280
there's no negotiated tough you<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

905
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:33,930
gonna have given one<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance to say like</font>

906
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,020
yes go away but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're still going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

907
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:39,600
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to explain what I'm happy</font>

908
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:41,490
to propose a diff on the mailing list

909
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,410
that would be like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know probably two</font>

910
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:46,410
sentences come and

911
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:48,509
and so I can be convinced the other way

912
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:50,069
I mean my immediate reaction was we're

913
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:52,619
not doing sin data what was the point

914
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:55,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">but data gathering I can see some much</font>

915
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:58,530
so if it doesn't make the RFC to TL DR

916
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:00,509
and it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> put an enormous burden on</font>

917
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:03,480
implementers and it doesn't take<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a</font>

918
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:05,970
bunch of Vienna space<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I don't see any</font>

919
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason to not produce something that</font>

920
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:09,598
someone might find useful I think the

921
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:12,000
real in my mind the biggest downside is

922
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,460
like we might men need like an extra API

923
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,190
for like completely disabled or<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll be</font>

924
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:22,380
another value for like that you know and

925
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:24,059
evil but me I could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been so</font>

926
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:27,770
thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle box cases and</font>

927
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:31,109
what you also reflect a basically empty

928
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:34,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP no option from the receiver</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beckoned</font>

929
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:35,670
was it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the neck because otherwise i</font>

930
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:39,089
would you have to set<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be bit to one</font>

931
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:41,039
so wouldn't exactly reflect it and but

932
00:38:39,089 --> 00:38:43,859
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea is if you if i send a</font>

933
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:47,579
TC if i send tcp you know to some server

934
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:49,950
uh and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the server like support ccpe</font>

935
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:51,930
know but like doesn't want to actually

936
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:55,078
encrypt it would just<font color="#E5E5E5"> send back an empty</font>

937
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:56,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP you know would be equal one so ba3</font>

938
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:58,349
bite option including the kind kind

939
00:38:56,609 --> 00:39:00,420
length and the global<font color="#E5E5E5"> option would be</font>

940
00:38:58,349 --> 00:39:02,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">equal one and no proposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taps and then</font>

941
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:05,069
encryption would be disabled but that

942
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,839
would allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to know that it would let</font>

943
00:39:05,069 --> 00:39:09,930
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to differentiate the case that you</font>

944
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:11,819
know the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle box is stripping off</font>

945
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:15,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">the you know option around the case now</font>

946
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:18,359
case report it it's just for weather for

947
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:20,160
the reply not for the initial sin I mean

948
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:21,808
it could also be the initial Sam I don't

949
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seem like as useful</font>

950
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:28,349
just in terms of functionality in the

951
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:30,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">spec if we're gonna define what it means</font>

952
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:32,220
to have no tap<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's zero or more</font>

953
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:33,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">tap ideas instead of one or more we</font>

954
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:36,270
might as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it both but I don't</font>

955
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:40,259
see or probably more useful and are in

956
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:41,849
reply from the server but we could also

957
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,470
have it be from the sin for like

958
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:44,940
explicitly like measurement stuff I

959
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:46,709
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect implementations want to</font>

960
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,990
do this by default but we can make it

961
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:51,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">legal so that to facilitate the</font>

962
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:53,308
measurement of you know how many

963
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,479
middleboxes this again through yeah what

964
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:57,150
I was thinking is if you want the

965
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,480
measurement case you can at least

966
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:03,240
say if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if you receive an empty um</font>

967
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,400
you know you should you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know reply to it</font>

968
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,169
so you under the measurement so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

969
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,480
specify what the receiver has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and</font>

970
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:11,069
not specify that you yeah you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

971
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,779
they make it and make it legal for the

972
00:40:11,069 --> 00:40:15,359
sender to send an empty one but not

973
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:18,660
suggested<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet do it yeah yeah so that</font>

974
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,400
yeah okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> good heart I think the path</font>

975
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,980
forward sounds like proposed proposed

976
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">two diff on the list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proposed that the</font>

this but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> my concern up there isn't</font>

982
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:40,470
so much technical merit or lack thereof

983
00:40:36,029 --> 00:40:42,569
it's a colonizer<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's a reasonably</font>

00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,759
short path from here to work or blast

985

00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:53,700
history of doing a lot of work for a few

989
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:55,650
weeks right around the meetings and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

990
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,058
like a long space in between where

991
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:58,890
nothing seems to happen so we don't want

992
00:40:57,059 --> 00:41:02,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wait until</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me I would very much I</font>

993
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:04,379
mean um don't know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> next mugs I</font>

994
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:07,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">have some as mirrior probably knows I</font>

995
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:09,390
have some some tsv WG stuff I gotta deal

996
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,220
with but I very much want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get these</font>

997
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:16,799
drafts working group last call by Jim

998
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:21,450
let's go get<font color="#CCCCCC"> us know that all right let</font>

999
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:28,770
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> andre's up and go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slides so we</font>

1000
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:30,808
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCP critic all right all right yeah</font>

1001
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:33,630
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I Mandrell talk about these speed</font>

1002
00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:37,079
gripped so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll start with a refresher</font>

1003
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:39,450
on the protocol so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the four-way</font>

1004
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:42,510
handshake of<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP crypt we use you know</font>

1005
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:46,078
to signal support and so in the first

1006
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:48,119
round trip we we do the negotiation for

1007
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,490
the public key ciphers so in this case

1008
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:56,609
the act of opener is saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

1009
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:58,649
support p 5 to 1 and p 2 56<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pass an</font>

1010
00:41:56,609 --> 00:42:02,279
opener replies saying hey let's go ahead

1011
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:05,220
and do you know p curve 256 and it sets

1012
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:09,089
the passive opener bit that David talked

1013
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:10,890
about extensively so the second round

1014
00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:13,710
trip is about symmetric

1015
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:16,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">Seifer negotiation and exchanging public</font>

1016
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:19,950
key material so in this case the act of

1017
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:21,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">opener saying escort aes-128 and 256 it</font>

1018
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:25,410
sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> its nonce and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> public key and</font>

1019
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:28,650
the passive opener selects the symmetric

1020
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:30,980
cipher this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> aes-256</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and sends its</font>

1021
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:34,859
own non send its own public key material

1022
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:37,470
so we basically extended TTP's three-way

1023
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:39,808
handshake by adding one extra leg for

1024
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:42,328
negotiation and the fundamental<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font>

1025
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:44,099
for this was that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keys</font>

1026
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:46,230
are large they don't fit an option space

1027
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:49,289
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we put them in data that is invisible</font>

1028
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:51,180
to apps and that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we start sending</font>

1029
00:42:49,289 --> 00:42:52,470
key material only<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the third leg</font>

1030
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:56,930
because that's when we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

1031
00:42:52,470 --> 00:43:00,629
sending data so<font color="#E5E5E5"> after we've done this</font>

1032
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:01,950
key exchange both ends compute their you

1033
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:03,269
know their do their diffie-hellman or

1034
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:05,308
whatever algorithm they're using them

1035
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:06,808
they get their key agreement result

1036
00:43:05,309 --> 00:43:08,089
which is not transmitted on the wire

1037
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:10,730
obviously that's how you get your

1038
00:43:08,089 --> 00:43:13,440
protection against passive eavesdropping

1039
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:15,509
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take all that information the key</font>

1040
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,390
agreement material and all the bits of

1041
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:20,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">the handshake and the hash that all</font>

1042
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:22,890
together and you you get your session

1043
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:25,309
secret from that you derive your session

1044
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:27,960
ID so you can see from this that

1045
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:29,880
intuitively if you create a TCP

1046
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,839
connection and the two session IDs match

1047
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:35,250
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that nobody tampered with your</font>

1048
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:36,779
handshake nobody modified<font color="#E5E5E5"> your bits in</font>

1049
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,940
the unit<font color="#E5E5E5"> one or nobody modified your</font>

1050
00:43:36,779 --> 00:43:40,259
publicly or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1051
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,240
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how applications could do their</font>

1052
00:43:40,259 --> 00:43:45,930
authentication top of TCP creek by

1053
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:48,750
verifying that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> session IDs match and</font>

1054
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:51,450
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that session secret you also derive</font>

1055
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:53,490
all your keys for your symmetric ciphers

1056
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:58,109
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> max and essentially for your</font>

1057
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:59,519
authenticated encryption so once you

1058
00:43:58,109 --> 00:44:02,098
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your key material how do we</font>

1059
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:05,008
actually encrypt the data so we take the

1060
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:07,190
user data and we create records out of

1061
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:09,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so we have our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own framing the user</font>

1062
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:12,569
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> user data of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> T speed</font>

1063
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:16,078
portion and we've got a control bite a

1064
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:17,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">cipher text length and a cipher text so</font>

1065
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:23,160
the controlled<font color="#E5E5E5"> by currently has only one</font>

1066
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:24,610
bit defined which is the rekey bit and

1067
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,379
that's used<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1068
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:27,700
you know rotating your keys question

1069
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:30,520
yeah I have actually question about

1070
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:33,250
previous lighter one of things i would

1071
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:36,250
say so so you put both the Holy no

1072
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:38,710
transcript<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've mean this a secret you</font>

1073
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:41,260
know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that if middle box are</font>

1074
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:43,150
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessary single bit there this</font>

1075
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:45,130
will generate the different keys it's

1076
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:48,070
built and how do you detect that that

1077
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:49,930
the keys are wrong because they take us

1078
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:51,490
one of the problems with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ike ike wash</font>

1079
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:53,140
one was that they've used to same thing

1080
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:55,540
we actually put everything and if you're

1081
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:57,220
something wrong you get an encryption

1082
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,570
failure then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't notice it</font>

1083
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,879
anywhere else don't have a decryption

1084
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:03,340
fatal wreck its first serve it annoying

1085
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,990
because you you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it</font>

1086
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:06,880
would like to disable it and fall back

1087
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:09,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">to clear decks in here this case but I</font>

1088
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,690
mean yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I fear some kind of in a</font>

1089
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:13,779
handshake to take check out that yes

1090
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:14,710
this is something wrong or right so and

1091
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:16,240
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brought up</font>

1092
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:18,760
previously like you know should we

1093
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,529
normalize the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP options in certain way</font>

1094
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:23,560
like if they get reordered or something

1095
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:25,750
like that um David I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know if we</font>

1096
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:28,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually ended up doing that and you</font>

1097
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:30,310
know yeah so I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is David let's</font>

1098
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">hear some Stanford I just want to point</font>

1099
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:34,990
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the the eno transcript doesn't</font>

1100
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:36,040
mean like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp segments</font>

1101
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:37,750
right that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> transfer is like a</font>

1102
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:41,980
very specific thing that's defined in

1103
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:43,420
the inner document and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just actually</font>

1104
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:46,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get bite more or less that they</font>

1105
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:47,170
eat because there is there's no possible

1106
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:50,680
that there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else wrong with</font>

1107
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:52,660
this and it's it's usually better to get

1108
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:55,149
you know clear feedback that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1109
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:57,910
something wrong una authentication

1110
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:59,350
failure right and do something else<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

1111
00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:01,210
to just get you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I get random</font>

1112
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:03,339
garbage in because I my decryption fails

1113
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:06,640
for it for every pocket after that point

1114
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:08,830
so it yeah but it was still getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

1115
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">indication</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> failure in in that you know</font>

1116
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:12,190
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get weeded back at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1117
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:14,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something wrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ids</font>

1118
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:16,480
are wrong not like one<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to focus</font>

1119
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:18,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">attend testing ideas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both ends and don't</font>

1120
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,990
attend oh they are actually wrong yes

1121
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:22,000
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have explicit key</font>

1122
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:24,930
verification that's that's your voice oh

1123
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,060
yeah it's untested so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac would fail</font>

1124
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:31,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it does but it does feel reliably so</font>

1125
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:34,600
somebody really screws we really uh

1126
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:37,270
bleats with this in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle so that</font>

1127
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,560
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> session Keys don't match you get</font>

1128
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:39,850
authentication failure

1129
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:44,190
you don't get ciphertext going up the

1130
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:44,190
stack you get a connection hang<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1131
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:51,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay cool so yeah so that is a</font>

1132
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:54,730
difference with us which<font color="#CCCCCC"> has key</font>

1133
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:57,400
verification okay good so we got our

1134
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:58,750
keys and we frame our user data I was

1135
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,100
saying there's a controlled by currently

1136
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,870
there's only one bit defined in that

1137
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:04,080
controlled by which is a rekey bit used

1138
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:06,009
for rotating keys and long live session

1139
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:09,549
there's a length<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's a</font>

1140
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:11,650
cipher text inside the ciphertext we

1141
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:14,020
replicate some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP flags so we've</font>

1142
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:16,570
got a flag bite currently we replicate

1143
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:18,640
the fin bit and the urgent bit so we

1144
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:21,370
could support you know clean connection

1145
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,980
shut down an urgent data if urgent data

1146
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:26,770
is present we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have we include</font>

1147
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:28,780
the urgent pointer and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1148
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:32,380
follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with the actual application</font>

1149
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:33,430
data and all of this is both Mac then

1150
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:37,480
encrypt that it's authenticated

1151
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:39,100
encryption so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little</font>

1152
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:42,250
bit about session caching because that

1153
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:46,270
was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest change since</font>

1154
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:48,910
Berlin so if I talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you in the past</font>

1155
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:50,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I want to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you again we could</font>

1156
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:52,450
optimize things we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to do</font>

1157
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:53,440
public here operations anymore but what

1158
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:56,470
we could do is we could take our

1159
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,480
previous session secret and compute the

1160
00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:01,390
next session secret for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font>

1161
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,040
communication i have with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and based</font>

1162
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:06,310
on that i could compute the you know the

1163
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:08,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">next session ID and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next encryption</font>

1164
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:10,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">keys and so on we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could keep doing this</font>

1165
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:14,890
essentially forever until we just clear

1166
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:16,420
our cash so that's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> it saves us</font>

1167
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:18,700
computation power you don't have to do

1168
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:20,620
public key operations anymore but more

1169
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,029
importantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it saves us on</font>

1170
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:24,279
latency because now we could

1171
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:26,110
re-establish a<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP crypt connection in</font>

1172
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:28,890
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing three-way handshake we no</font>

1173
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:31,720
longer have to add<font color="#CCCCCC"> that extra fourth leg</font>

1174
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:34,569
so the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> it works is it's very similar</font>

1175
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:38,350
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> original handshake we say hey I</font>

1176
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:40,360
support you know p 5 to 1 and p 5 to 6

1177
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:43,690
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case what we're signaling in</font>

1178
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:45,730
the p55<font color="#CCCCCC"> 21 case is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to resume a</font>

1179
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:48,910
session with this session ID and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1180
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:51,700
example it's you know 392 and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1181
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:52,390
we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> iNOS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> variable length a sub</font>

1182
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:55,660
options

1183
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:56,920
it's a signal session resumption so

1184
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:00,519
we're basically saying we want to resume

1185
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:02,980
that previous session of<font color="#CCCCCC"> p52 with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1186
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:06,609
set with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> new session ID and then in</font>

1187
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:08,680
the response if session resumption was

1188
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:11,009
successful we reply yeah sure let's do

1189
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:13,779
that and we use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> variable length sub on</font>

1190
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:17,500
tenth so basically we're saying yeah

1191
00:49:13,779 --> 00:49:19,930
resume<font color="#CCCCCC"> 521 it's a variable-length sub</font>

1192
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,119
and nothing there so that one bit lets

1193
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:23,828
us distinguish whether it's a fresh key

1194
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:27,099
negotiation or whether it's a resumption

1195
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:28,869
attempt and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just send a knack</font>

1196
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:30,279
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> email option and at this point</font>

1197
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:34,359
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could start sending encrypted data</font>

1198
00:49:30,279 --> 00:49:35,650
right away so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we do session</font>

1199
00:49:34,359 --> 00:49:37,779
resumption this is a little bit

1200
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:40,779
different from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> original TCP crypt</font>

1201
00:49:37,779 --> 00:49:42,339
spec were or hint back from a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1202
00:49:40,779 --> 00:49:45,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">meetings ago where we would have an</font>

1203
00:49:42,339 --> 00:49:47,920
explicit tip for session resumption so

1204
00:49:45,339 --> 00:49:50,980
it would be something like TCP crypt

1205
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,029
dash session resume and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could</font>

1206
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:54,849
have been that could have meant any

1207
00:49:52,029 --> 00:49:56,500
cipher effectively here we're being

1208
00:49:54,849 --> 00:49:58,089
explicit and saying what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cipher is</font>

1209
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:01,420
and that has some nice properties which

1210
00:49:58,089 --> 00:50:03,430
I'll talk about later so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1211
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:06,460
changed since the last meeting was we

1212
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:08,470
cleaned up session assumption so one of

1213
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:12,970
the things we did is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if we're</font>

1214
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:15,459
resuming you know p<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one that</font>

1215
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:18,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">also implicitly means that we're willing</font>

1216
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:21,190
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start fresh with p 521 so we don't</font>

1217
00:50:18,279 --> 00:50:22,930
have to say hey resume key<font color="#CCCCCC"> 521 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

1218
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:25,119
by the way include a couple of extra

1219
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:27,069
bytes saying we're also willing to do

1220
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">five to one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fresh so we're kind of</font>

1221
00:50:27,069 --> 00:50:30,430
saving options<font color="#CCCCCC"> space</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there because it</font>

1222
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:34,089
seems like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a pretty common use</font>

1223
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:39,190
pattern the other thing we've done is we

1224
00:50:34,089 --> 00:50:40,930
explicitly forbid resuming you know two

1225
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:44,079
sessions in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same connection so I</font>

1226
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:46,359
can't say resume five to<font color="#E5E5E5"> one session idx</font>

1227
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,039
and resume five to one session ID why

1228
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:50,109
because now this creates ambiguity and

1229
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:51,490
it also feels<font color="#E5E5E5"> like unnatural I don't you</font>

1230
00:50:50,109 --> 00:50:55,480
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no real application for</font>

1231
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:57,359
this so we explicitly disallow that you

1232
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:00,250
can only resume one specific session

1233
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:02,200
intuitively makes sense and also

1234
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:03,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that changed that I briefly</font>

1235
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,319
mentioned from the previous meeting in

1236
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:09,739
Berlin actually this change happened

1237
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:12,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">Berlin is this notion of being explicit</font>

1238
00:51:09,739 --> 00:51:14,930
about which<font color="#E5E5E5"> cipher your resuming so we</font>

1239
00:51:12,949 --> 00:51:17,359
have an API after you connect the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font>

1240
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:18,999
crib that tells you what cipher was used

1241
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:21,469
in your public key negotiation

1242
00:51:18,999 --> 00:51:24,109
previously we used this generic session

1243
00:51:21,469 --> 00:51:25,579
resumption tip and our session ID it

1244
00:51:24,109 --> 00:51:27,558
sorry in our session resumption and that

1245
00:51:25,579 --> 00:51:29,420
would mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if the app</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked what's</font>

1246
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:32,329
i forgot negotiated he would get back

1247
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:33,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">this answer saying you know the session</font>

1248
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:36,079
resumption tap which is not very

1249
00:51:33,589 --> 00:51:37,880
informative it's a little bit weird just

1250
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,160
by changing the protocol by being

1251
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:43,640
explicit now the API is more kind of

1252
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:46,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">home of genius and makes more sense and</font>

1253
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:49,190
it also lets us do this implicit notion

1254
00:51:46,609 --> 00:51:52,969
of if you want to resume<font color="#E5E5E5"> X you're also</font>

1255
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:54,709
willing to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> fresh with X so these</font>

1256
00:51:52,969 --> 00:51:56,839
are kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the main</font>

1257
00:51:54,709 --> 00:51:58,819
changes that happened since the last

1258
00:51:56,839 --> 00:52:00,859
meeting with regards to session

1259
00:51:58,819 --> 00:52:04,910
resumption there were a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

1260
00:52:00,859 --> 00:52:08,199
changes in TCP crypt ah some of them

1261
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:10,848
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we are explicitly disabled</font>

1262
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:13,609
disallowing sending data in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sin</font>

1263
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:16,099
segment so you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do</font>

1264
00:52:13,609 --> 00:52:17,239
stuff like TFO it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work out</font>

1265
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:19,910
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you would have to build</font>

1266
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:23,869
something on<font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of TCP grip than you</font>

1267
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:26,390
know like David mentioned before and we

1268
00:52:23,869 --> 00:52:28,969
also move the TCP crypt specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> api's</font>

1269
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:31,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the API documents so now the TCP</font>

1270
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:34,279
crypt document just focuses on Krypto

1271
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:37,400
aspects<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nassib document got shorter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1272
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:39,289
respect to so that's really it you know

1273
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,789
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot not a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> changed I feel like</font>

1274
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:42,140
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying this for the</font>

1275
00:52:40,789 --> 00:52:44,029
past couple of meetings in terms of

1276
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,589
crypt I think we're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the end</font>

1277
00:52:44,029 --> 00:52:47,509
you know it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> really small tweaks</font>

1278
00:52:45,589 --> 00:52:50,089
and polishing the you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

1279
00:52:47,509 --> 00:52:51,769
gone from you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> packing base that's y</font>

1280
00:52:50,089 --> 00:52:54,380
lv you know the big changes already

1281
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:55,729
happened in the last couple of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

1282
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:58,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're really getting for the end</font>

1283
00:52:55,729 --> 00:53:00,319
so in terms of the draft yeah like is it

1284
00:52:58,339 --> 00:53:03,049
complete it sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we're getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1285
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:04,549
a last call pretty soon the

1286
00:53:03,049 --> 00:53:06,229
implementation we still need a kernel

1287
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:10,219
implementation we personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

1288
00:53:06,229 --> 00:53:11,899
made progress on that and also which was

1289
00:53:10,219 --> 00:53:13,789
mentioned by the chairs we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

1290
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,930
seeking for independent implementations

1291
00:53:13,789 --> 00:53:18,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is where we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1292
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:20,149
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of weed out the bugs and and</font>

1293
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:23,450
possibly even fine

1294
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:24,799
you know ambiguity in the spec you know

1295
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:27,109
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody actually sits down and tries</font>

1296
00:53:24,799 --> 00:53:28,819
to write code that's when you spot you

1297
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:31,250
know we've all been see done that effort

1298
00:53:28,819 --> 00:53:33,410
but as<font color="#CCCCCC"> author</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes it's you know</font>

1299
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:35,270
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of harder to see past that</font>

1300
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:37,549
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep trying looking for people to</font>

1301
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:40,609
implement a little comment that there is

1302
00:53:37,549 --> 00:53:44,000
in the broader community significant

1303
00:53:40,609 --> 00:53:47,259
competition for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of likely</font>

1304
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,309
implementers from both TLS 13 and quick

1305
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:51,619
there are given in i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you should</font>

1306
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:53,240
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know use the chicago</font>

1307
00:53:51,619 --> 00:53:54,950
hackathon or<font color="#E5E5E5"> suchlike that predicate</font>

1308
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,569
people to come there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and without through</font>

1309
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:58,490
implementation and testing and so on

1310
00:53:56,569 --> 00:54:00,288
because the Teotl<font color="#E5E5E5"> s1 poetry is using</font>

1311
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:01,970
tacit owns throughout the interrupt

1312
00:54:00,289 --> 00:54:04,520
testing and writing the code and so on

1313
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:05,868
and i would expect if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just get you</font>

1314
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:07,069
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to get students or something</font>

1315
00:54:05,869 --> 00:54:08,690
like that will come there and to make

1316
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:11,058
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> all implementation of that you</font>

1317
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:14,359
bring a pile of code to seed the

1318
00:54:11,059 --> 00:54:16,609
hackathon yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the reasons</font>

1319
00:54:14,359 --> 00:54:18,348
that one of the reasons why tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1320
00:54:16,609 --> 00:54:20,270
successful what the hackathon is that

1321
00:54:18,349 --> 00:54:22,309
these are these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working on this</font>

1322
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:24,079
yes i felt i'm joe i obviously the web

1323
00:54:22,309 --> 00:54:26,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">pateros if there were some student teams</font>

1324
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,529
this time also<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a for do not do some</font>

1325
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:29,480
other things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1326
00:54:27,529 --> 00:54:31,099
there is some you know university people

1327
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">here could actually you know try to get</font>

1328
00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:33,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">anna some of the students were actually</font>

1329
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:35,660
working from there you know not

1330
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:37,789
traveling actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ruptured working</font>

1331
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:40,069
no over the lines and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on some but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1332
00:54:37,789 --> 00:54:42,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">starts to get but I I don't have time to</font>

1333
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:43,609
do the TCP crib sorry but I was thinking

1334
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:45,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that would be something that</font>

1335
00:54:43,609 --> 00:54:46,940
actually also<font color="#CCCCCC"> they take you know the</font>

1336
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:49,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">list of you know things but where people</font>

1337
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:51,020
are interesting doing in in hackathon

1338
00:54:49,069 --> 00:54:52,339
and if you put you know TCP crypt and

1339
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:54,559
you are willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be there there might</font>

1340
00:54:52,339 --> 00:54:55,819
be some other people also be like I mean

1341
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:57,349
I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good idea yeah at every</font>

1342
00:54:55,819 --> 00:54:58,520
suggestion especially if we start that

1343
00:54:57,349 --> 00:54:59,779
effort early maybe we can start

1344
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,849
identifying some people and we could

1345
00:54:59,779 --> 00:55:05,599
provide some framework code you know

1346
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:08,180
some frame unicode give give give the

1347
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:10,940
crypto code give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gift in the</font>

1348
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:12,710
parse code I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it given the</font>

1349
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:14,690
functional blocks of code that they can

1350
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:17,510
reuse and then you can have people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

1351
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:20,390
aren't the experts in the crypto or in

1352
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:22,309
options whistling just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go fight the</font>

1353
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:25,368
fight the integration into the kernel

1354
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:27,710
stack internal environment you could

1355
00:55:25,369 --> 00:55:29,900
even there's also a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> initiative i</font>

1356
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:31,880
would say a website which was called

1357
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:33,730
code my match and it's now called

1358
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:36,369
somehow differently forgot

1359
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:37,810
name it's a website basically I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

1360
00:55:36,369 --> 00:55:39,550
what what you need where you need

1361
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:40,869
implementations and people can look up

1362
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:43,030
if they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do an implementation I</font>

1363
00:55:40,869 --> 00:55:51,030
can send information the nativist it

1364
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:53,800
please your bright<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay anything else I</font>

1365
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:56,050
guess we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the API</font>

1366
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:57,640
I just point out that David my zero-sum

1367
00:55:56,050 --> 00:56:00,250
Stanford if anyone here has<font color="#CCCCCC"> deep pockets</font>

1368
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:01,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">pockets course I'd be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> delighted to hire</font>

1369
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:04,090
someone to Stanford to do this stuff but

1370
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:05,590
like this thing has gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> out for long</font>

1371
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:11,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough that we kind of ran out of</font>

1372
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:15,250
funding and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll pass the collection</font>

1373
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:18,160
plate around all right so you want on

1374
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:21,040
the api doc and then bring up the CFR<font color="#CCCCCC"> g</font>

1375
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:24,700
slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes sounds good so api doc who</font>

1376
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:28,930
wants to address that since we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

1377
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:31,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide for it i assume the api doc is</font>

1378
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:35,319
functionally complete and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about its</font>

1379
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:40,060
it'll be ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> for work last call along</font>

1380
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:42,640
with the other two drafts right yeah

1381
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:45,160
David misers that that's the idea yeah I

1382
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,868
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were you know I as I was doing</font>

1383
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,509
the slides I realized were missing this

1384
00:56:46,869 --> 00:56:52,140
mandatory bit and then maybe there'll be

1385
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:55,180
another option to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay like you know</font>

1386
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:57,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">disabled completely versus like respond</font>

1387
00:56:55,180 --> 00:57:00,850
with an empty you know option but I

1388
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:03,040
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're you know a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> small patch</font>

1389
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:05,200
away from being final this look my

1390
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:08,140
inclination is to sequence the last

1391
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:10,390
calls to send to do a first last call on

1392
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:12,190
the protocols take<font color="#E5E5E5"> ino and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP crypt as</font>

1393
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:14,799
a package in one work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> last call and</font>

1394
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:16,390
that one might run a little long because

1395
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,160
we're going to have to go find outside

1396
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:21,310
experts we know where to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

1397
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:23,109
one expert on the options I'm sure we

1398
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:24,880
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> find one or two other other dtp</font>

1399
00:57:23,109 --> 00:57:27,190
people take a look Kyle probably has

1400
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:31,240
some some likely suspects to go triple

1401
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:33,460
check the crypto and then but<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1402
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:35,350
include the<font color="#E5E5E5"> API document first review</font>

1403
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:37,840
last call but<font color="#CCCCCC"> send it to a group glass</font>

1404
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:39,609
call shortly thereafter so that we don't

1405
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:45,100
get the docs to disconnect from each

1406
00:57:39,609 --> 00:57:46,960
other um can we increase is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible</font>

1407
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,620
there's a kind of a procedural question

1408
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,810
but the star

1409
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:52,089
tcp Krypton<font color="#CCCCCC"> TSP you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last call's at</font>

1410
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:53,470
the same time but then oh I plan I I

1411
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:55,480
plan to do more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our the same</font>

1412
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:57,339
time I<font color="#CCCCCC"> planned us in one in nelson says</font>

1413
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:59,080
these two drafts are going are in

1414
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,280
working group last call and it's a

1415
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,319
single working last call on both docs

1416
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,940
yes but then could like if you know

1417
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:06,220
could like to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would imagine</font>

1418
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:08,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">it might take more time for crypto</font>

1419
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:10,180
review for tcp crib versus you know so

1420
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:12,460
they have to finish at the same time<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1421
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:15,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">could you know we can decide what what</font>

1422
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:17,170
to do my preps<font color="#E5E5E5"> workgroup chair is to is</font>

1423
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:19,570
to chain those two drafts together and

1424
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:22,300
just keep them<font color="#E5E5E5"> going as a pair because i</font>

1425
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:26,410
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking someone to review one</font>

1426
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:29,080
without the other is a bit much whereas

1427
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:31,210
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the api doc is separable it's</font>

1428
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:34,020
got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationship</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think if the api</font>

1429
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:37,270
doc runs a month or six weeks behind

1430
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:39,640
behind the main drafts that's probably

1431
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:42,250
okay because if we find anything we'll

1432
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:48,009
still have time to catch it before the

1433
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:54,390
iesg pronounces on the any of them well

1434
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:57,390
that was easy no all right okay all

1435
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:57,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">right</font>

1436
00:58:59,089 --> 00:59:08,180
alright so there was some interest among

1437
00:59:05,029 --> 00:59:10,519
the security area directors and

1438
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:14,509
transport and the chairs to get some

1439
00:59:10,519 --> 00:59:16,459
additional additional eyeballs looking

1440
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:19,339
at the looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the crypto in TCP</font>

1441
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:21,739
crypt before mgcp you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we</font>

1442
00:59:19,339 --> 00:59:24,469
decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go to work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the class call</font>

1443
00:59:21,739 --> 00:59:26,950
and there were some it this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1444
00:59:24,469 --> 00:59:29,690
result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some questions that had been</font>

1445
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:33,049
sort of bubbling up over the course of

1446
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:35,589
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year and a half or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so and so</font>

1447
00:59:33,049 --> 00:59:38,839
what I tried to do was compile them into

1448
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:41,029
into small edible chunks that we could

1449
00:59:38,839 --> 00:59:43,999
send to the CFR gmail enlist and

1450
00:59:41,029 --> 00:59:46,160
hopefully get some get some some

1451
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:49,700
guidance on and so the first question

1452
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:52,219
was around the TCP crypt session ID and

1453
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:56,029
specifically what properties does it

1454
00:59:52,219 --> 00:59:58,219
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have and why does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

1455
00:59:56,029 --> 01:00:00,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">have those properties or what properties</font>

1456
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:06,549
does that does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> have as described by</font>

1457
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:10,219
the by the draft and so so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance</font>

1458
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:12,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">the one of the properties that the</font>

1459
01:00:10,219 --> 01:00:15,739
system relies on it feeds<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

1460
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:17,450
session ID feeds the transcript and and

1461
01:00:15,739 --> 01:00:21,019
some other information the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key</font>

1462
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:23,509
agreement and whatnot and so is it

1463
01:00:21,019 --> 01:00:27,049
necessary for instance for that for that

1464
01:00:23,509 --> 01:00:29,269
session ID to in order to in order to

1465
01:00:27,049 --> 01:00:32,089
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the security properties that we</font>

1466
01:00:29,269 --> 01:00:35,269
want out of this protocol is it

1467
01:00:32,089 --> 01:00:37,009
necessary for that ID to be to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1468
01:00:35,269 --> 01:00:40,308
unpredictable or is it or does it just

1469
01:00:37,009 --> 01:00:42,019
need to be unique overall time so that

1470
01:00:40,309 --> 01:00:44,210
you can't have you can't possibly have

1471
01:00:42,019 --> 01:00:45,919
two connections with the same ID unless

1472
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:50,839
they were engineered by two endpoints

1473
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:52,400
colluding which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dumb so so</font>

1474
01:00:50,839 --> 01:00:54,259
that was the first question that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had</font>

1475
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,150
and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually like a it's it's</font>

1476
01:00:54,259 --> 01:00:57,859
probably written better in the email

1477
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:59,509
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i sent so so if you want to take a</font>

1478
01:00:57,859 --> 01:01:02,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at that it's on the CFR gmail</font>

1479
01:00:59,509 --> 01:01:04,009
enlist from<font color="#E5E5E5"> october second and actually</font>

1480
01:01:02,509 --> 01:01:07,549
got some really good responses to this

1481
01:01:04,009 --> 01:01:10,249
the best response I got was off list and

1482
01:01:07,549 --> 01:01:11,479
it was by someone named Nataniel<font color="#CCCCCC"> el I</font>

1483
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:12,259
don't know if any of you guys know who

1484
01:01:11,479 --> 01:01:15,620
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1485
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:19,130
I don't know who who what L is but he

1486
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:22,130
sent me a fairly long analysis of of how

1487
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:23,570
he you know of how the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cryptid works and</font>

1488
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:25,880
what properties he thinks is that it

1489
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:27,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">requires and so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think I sent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to</font>

1490
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,330
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys if anyone else wants to see it</font>

1491
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,740
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to forward it along I didn't</font>

1492
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:34,700
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it on the list because he</font>

1493
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:36,410
didn't respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the list but but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

1494
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:38,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to anyone individually</font>

1495
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:41,259
so just send<font color="#CCCCCC"> me send me or they did an</font>

1496
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:42,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">email and I could forward that along and</font>

1497
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:45,380
then there were there were some other

1498
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:49,430
responses as well that were of interest

1499
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:51,050
and those all went to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list um so</font>

1500
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:53,240
that was the that was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first question</font>

1501
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:58,520
so the second question that I sent was

1502
01:01:53,240 --> 01:02:00,950
around the the generic how does the

1503
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:05,960
generic nature of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ino as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a negotiation</font>

1504
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:09,620
protocol for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tepes a feed into what the</font>

1505
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:13,550
requirements for session IDs are right

1506
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:16,910
and so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea here is that that you</font>

1507
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:18,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">use an application that makes use of you</font>

1508
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:21,200
know in mandatory application-aware mode

1509
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:25,190
is assuming i mean it's it's it's it's

1510
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:27,259
mandating that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know is</font>

1511
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:29,150
available and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is some tip</font>

1512
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:31,100
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in common between two machines</font>

1513
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:33,050
and it produces a session ID that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1514
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:35,450
then used for endpoint authentication

1515
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:38,030
what properties for instance does that

1516
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:40,580
session ID need to have and what

1517
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:42,380
properties should be no guarantee to

1518
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:46,370
applications that are mandatory

1519
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:47,930
application-aware so the the situation

1520
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:49,549
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was concerned about I know I sent</font>

1521
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:51,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">an email about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this like a year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and</font>

1522
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:53,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">we stood around for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a while on it i</font>

1523
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:55,940
didn't i didn't really feel satisfied

1524
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:58,310
with the answer that came out the the

1525
01:02:55,940 --> 01:03:01,190
worry that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have is that applications</font>

1526
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:03,259
will treat this interface as a black box

1527
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:05,090
with the properties of<font color="#E5E5E5"> whichever tap</font>

1528
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:09,280
happens to be the default which in this

1529
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:13,790
case of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP crypt um but is that</font>

1530
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:15,560
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not without explicit without</font>

1531
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:18,320
explicitly listing what the properties

1532
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:21,140
of the session ID need to be that

1533
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:23,840
assumption may wind up falling over if

1534
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:24,890
you if say the default tix<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is to</font>

1535
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,090
something completely different that has

1536
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:27,980
totally different security drop

1537
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:29,390
right like let's say it's let's say you

1538
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:32,270
switch to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some tip that for some reason</font>

1539
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:35,420
requires the session ID to remain secret

1540
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:38,660
right in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that case publishing a signed</font>

1541
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:40,520
list of session IDs to you know to a

1542
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:42,080
public web server and using that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as your</font>

1543
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:44,690
out-of-band authentication channel is

1544
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:45,620
not is obviously not<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you want</font>

1545
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:46,850
to do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might be able to</font>

1546
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:50,779
derive session piece from that or

1547
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:52,759
whatnot<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so going back I made</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1548
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:55,340
slides in a rush<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I didn't get them in</font>

1549
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:56,900
quite the right speaking order but like

1550
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:58,910
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the one of the questions I had</font>

1551
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:00,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">was well does the session ID need to be</font>

1552
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:02,509
computationally indistinguishable<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

1553
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:04,640
random well not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really and in fact it</font>

1554
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:07,040
isn't because the first byte is always

1555
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:10,549
is is predictable or at least it's in a

1556
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:12,500
small space right so and even even if

1557
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:14,600
the session ID even if every bit of the

1558
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:17,590
session ID was slightly biased toward

1559
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:20,270
one for instance it would still be

1560
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:22,850
secure as long as there was enough

1561
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:26,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">entropy in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent</font>

1562
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:27,950
someone from from guessing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and there</font>

1563
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,839
and as long as there are mechanisms in

1564
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:32,270
place to guarantee<font color="#CCCCCC"> that its unique</font>

1565
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:35,980
overall time right so what I really

1566
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:38,570
would like is some is some generic

1567
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:41,060
crypto guidance on the right way to

1568
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:43,340
phrase some of the properties that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1569
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:45,410
want out of this thing because I think

1570
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:47,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">like right now they're either over</font>

1571
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:50,509
specified or under specified and I'm not

1572
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:52,970
entirely sure which I'm also not sure

1573
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:55,370
that this is that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is worth all the</font>

1574
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:56,569
trouble because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this may</font>

1575
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:58,940
be one of the situations where<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1576
01:04:56,570 --> 01:05:03,110
see the spec and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of they know</font>

1577
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:06,380
what it means but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel like precision</font>

1578
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:08,630
at this time is<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably worth pursuing</font>

1579
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:12,500
as long as it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to consume</font>

1580
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:15,980
undo resources um yeah so David Mazouz

1581
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:18,470
so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in you know in general</font>

1582
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:20,690
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what we've learned and</font>

1583
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:22,310
encrypt though is you want to like over

1584
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:24,320
specify these things like most people

1585
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:26,000
don't actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know most attacks</font>

1586
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:28,400
don't actually take the form of like you

1587
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,840
know a chosen ciphertext attack but the

1588
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,460
idea is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can survive</font>

1589
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:33,440
vacuum if your algorithm can survive

1590
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:36,260
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> game then it can survive any game</font>

1591
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:38,840
so we've attempted in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eno draft to</font>

1592
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:40,550
be you know to err on the side of

1593
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,680
of kind of over specifying and that's

1594
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:45,020
why currently the Eno draft requires all

1595
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:46,580
but that first bite to be in this

1596
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:48,440
computational indistinguishable from

1597
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:49,819
random which that wasn't actually our

1598
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:52,160
idea someone else suggested on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mail</font>

1599
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:53,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">is but that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed like a nice way of it</font>

1600
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:57,140
seemed to encompass a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1601
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:58,819
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> not enough entropy and you know</font>

1602
01:05:57,140 --> 01:06:01,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like that that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you might</font>

1603
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:03,320
otherwise worry about so even though

1604
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:05,000
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably you know you're not</font>

1605
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:06,680
conceding your random generator with a

1606
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,900
session ID if it is competition to

1607
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:10,640
single random that might like rule out a

1608
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:12,800
bunch of other kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weird things that</font>

1609
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:14,690
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> problematic yeah I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

1610
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:16,550
one of the one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I was</font>

1611
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:18,500
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that I was sort of hoping for</font>

1612
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:20,660
because there are other protocols that

1613
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:24,860
need this the specific property that I

1614
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:27,350
think you're implying like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the there's</font>

1615
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:28,850
an NTP draft going through for ntp

1616
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:32,299
security that wants kind of the same

1617
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:34,759
thing around session identifiers the the

1618
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:37,610
all but the first byte thing just kind

1619
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:39,680
of like it hits that button of

1620
01:06:37,610 --> 01:06:43,520
architectural purity that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

1621
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:45,740
somewhere in my brain it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

1622
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:47,180
bugs<font color="#E5E5E5"> me but again I'm not sure that it's</font>

1623
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:49,520
worth the effort to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix that it's just</font>

1624
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:53,149
it's something that feels that that

1625
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:56,660
feels kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of kind of like a kludge if</font>

1626
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:58,400
that David black if if specifying it

1627
01:06:56,660 --> 01:07:01,100
that way which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

1628
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:03,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">byte is it is on its own and everything</font>

1629
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:05,960
else is computation is indistinguishable

1630
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:10,040
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> random is sufficient to solve the</font>

1631
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:11,420
problem there may be a tighter necessary

1632
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,890
condition but we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to go</font>

1633
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:14,930
looking for we simply need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

1634
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:19,400
convinced that that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is we</font>

1635
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:21,770
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> is solved I mean I think that</font>

1636
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:24,290
like this multiple necessary condition

1637
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:26,330
so one necessary condition is because

1638
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:30,770
you know is so agnostic about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> temp</font>

1639
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:33,799
it's that you cannot ever have to uh you

1640
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:35,750
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever have two different uh taps</font>

1641
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:37,520
producing the same session ID so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1642
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:38,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">totally agree that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first bite right</font>

1643
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,880
I understand what the first fighters for

1644
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:43,280
there's just there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> other way to do</font>

1645
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">it right there is no no cryptographers</font>

1646
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,610
out there so you know they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't</font>

1647
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:49,160
find a sháá 512 collision<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font>

1648
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:51,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">find a catch a collision but nobody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1649
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:52,740
assuming that you can't you know provide

1650
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:55,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">one message that</font>

1651
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:57,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">who's sha-512 hashes the same as another</font>

1652
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:59,040
messages like ketchup hash right like

1653
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:01,290
that's just not a common assumption

1654
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:03,060
people are making we can't make those

1655
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:04,259
kinds of assumptions across this all

1656
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:06,330
right well you can I mean I actually

1657
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:08,700
like a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago or so i posted a message</font>

1658
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:10,680
to the list describing a naive way of

1659
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:13,470
constructing two hashes that are easy

1660
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:15,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know you can find collisions</font>

1661
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:19,049
between the two<font color="#E5E5E5"> but not within each one</font>

1662
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:21,600
and this this also helps it's a variant

1663
01:08:19,049 --> 01:08:25,528
of what Tara was asking about earlier if

1664
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:29,850
somehow you get confused about which uh

1665
01:08:25,529 --> 01:08:31,980
which cipher you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the session ID</font>

1666
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:33,540
immediately d confuses you you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

1667
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:38,580
a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the trace and you can and you</font>

1668
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:41,880
can see what went wrong yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think one</font>

1669
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:43,439
of the just again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is more</font>

1670
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:45,210
like food for thought than anything else

1671
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:48,689
and I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get what I really want is</font>

1672
01:08:45,210 --> 01:08:50,700
some input from from cryptographers who

1673
01:08:48,689 --> 01:08:53,009
are who have worked on stuff like this

1674
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:55,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">before and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just sort of understand maybe</font>

1675
01:08:53,009 --> 01:08:57,960
maybe get a better understanding of what

1676
01:08:55,200 --> 01:09:00,778
they think these properties are should

1677
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:02,819
be and should be called<font color="#E5E5E5"> um you know like</font>

1678
01:09:00,779 --> 01:09:04,560
we talked about like unlink ability for

1679
01:09:02,819 --> 01:09:06,900
instance right to protect to protect

1680
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,670
client privacy what does that really

1681
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:11,608
mean like is there a formal definition

1682
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:14,759
for that somewhere and if so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

1683
01:09:11,609 --> 01:09:20,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">that mean for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like does the session ID</font>

1684
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:22,680
as defined in TCP crypt uh achieve that

1685
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:25,859
and does TV<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know properly require</font>

1686
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:27,750
that so I i mean i don't i don't think

1687
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:29,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this this stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to hold up</font>

1688
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:32,069
working with less call like that's not

1689
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:33,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">my intent it's more just to get input</font>

1690
01:09:32,069 --> 01:09:36,120
and see if there are ways to refine the

1691
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:39,269
the language and if there if there

1692
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:42,269
aren't then that's fine too I mean David

1693
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:44,069
again to be clear unlink ability is not

1694
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:47,940
provided by session<font color="#CCCCCC"> assumption right</font>

1695
01:09:44,069 --> 01:09:49,380
this is a trade-off right so one one or

1696
01:09:47,939 --> 01:09:51,689
the other but<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're behind a not</font>

1697
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:53,700
like in your resuming TCP<font color="#CCCCCC"> crepes look</font>

1698
01:09:51,689 --> 01:09:55,379
even though at the API level they look

1699
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:57,450
the same but like obviously someone

1700
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:59,130
could instrument there<font color="#E5E5E5"> Colonel or their</font>

1701
01:09:57,450 --> 01:10:00,630
TCP<font color="#E5E5E5"> stock and like figure out that</font>

1702
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:05,130
they're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> session resumption to the</font>

1703
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:06,620
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> person this is dkg just wondered</font>

1704
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:08,420
whether there are two different kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1705
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:10,309
ability what is unlink ability to the

1706
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:12,410
pier the others unlink ability to the

1707
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:13,550
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think it does session</font>

1708
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:16,910
resumption here does provide on my

1709
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:18,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">ability to the network so just again if</font>

1710
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:19,760
we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> being clear about</font>

1711
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:21,710
what we're specifying<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just say</font>

1712
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:24,200
unlike ability unlink ability to whom

1713
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:26,930
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> dkg could you see the microphone</font>

1714
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:29,470
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got a question for which you</font>

1715
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:31,550
might have have an insightful answer

1716
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:34,190
discussion is really interesting on it

1717
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:37,880
sounds like uh we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some</font>

1718
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:39,769
precise terms this this working group is

1719
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:42,830
not the place to write those definitions

1720
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:45,920
they buy they belong somewhere over in

1721
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:48,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">the security areas response to of the</font>

1722
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:50,510
pervasive monitoring and the like where

1723
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:52,550
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do you have any idea where we're</font>

1724
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:54,620
in security area that ought to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be I</font>

1725
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:56,720
don't sorry I'm not deep enough in the

1726
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:58,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">IETF fine-grained bureaucratic</font>

1727
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:00,950
hair-splitting today<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but and in</font>

1728
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:04,100
particularly you haven't seen a draft

1729
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:06,370
going through over there that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that</font>

1730
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:09,020
does the basic definition<font color="#CCCCCC"> of privacy of</font>

1731
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:11,540
privacy relevant security terms of

1732
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:12,980
kyle's looking for there are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1733
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:14,360
several places<font color="#E5E5E5"> where that kind of thing</font>

1734
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:15,919
has been discussed but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think if</font>

1735
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:18,469
it'd been directly applied the folks in

1736
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:21,550
the HR pc working group research group

1737
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:25,520
have actually got a fair number of

1738
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:27,650
specific terms trying to map like human

1739
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:30,410
rights concepts<font color="#E5E5E5"> to technical detail go</font>

1740
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:32,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">um I hear you well good for unlink</font>

1741
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:34,700
ability that's probably useful yeah yeah

1742
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:37,940
but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think that anyone has</font>

1743
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:40,550
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> assists systematized all right at</font>

1744
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:42,919
the very least we could pray I'm sorry

1745
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:48,430
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mic folks at the very least we</font>

1746
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:51,380
could record<font color="#E5E5E5"> a a sense that that</font>

1747
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:54,740
something more general ought to be done

1748
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:56,720
um and we would have found it useful if

1749
01:11:54,740 --> 01:12:00,070
we could have gotten to these terms but

1750
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:03,080
it's probably a security area<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh-uh-uh</font>

1751
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:05,630
activity not not not transport let me

1752
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:07,250
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that this is dkg and um I'm not</font>

1753
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:09,530
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that something more general should</font>

1754
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:11,570
have been done right this is we have a

1755
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:13,400
specific use case here where specific

1756
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:15,500
needs and I think that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do this</font>

1757
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:17,389
specific to TCP crypt that would be a

1758
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,920
useful contribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if that turns</font>

1759
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:20,270
out to be generalizable that's fine but

1760
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:23,420
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to block this kind</font>

1761
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:25,100
review were all<font color="#CCCCCC"> invited women</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

1762
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:27,620
head that the objects are trying to make

1763
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:32,590
i panted garbled is if somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

1764
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:36,860
written down definitions of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> relevant</font>

1765
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:39,080
crypto oriented properties like privacy

1766
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:40,910
and virginal mobility and what that Kyle

1767
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:42,559
could have just pointed to we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1768
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:46,210
found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful but not having that</font>

1769
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:48,680
should not block us I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> completely</font>

1770
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:50,960
yeah I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I again I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't suggesting</font>

1771
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:53,650
holding up the documents on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this basis</font>

1772
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:56,330
but it's more<font color="#CCCCCC"> like education and</font>

1773
01:12:53,650 --> 01:12:58,429
dissemination of knowledge about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1774
01:12:56,330 --> 01:13:00,140
right ways to phrase these things it

1775
01:12:58,430 --> 01:13:01,550
seems like we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it seems like that</font>

1776
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:03,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff doesn't actually exist at the</font>

1777
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:05,060
moment that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to we need to build</font>

1778
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:07,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">up that knowledge maybe have a set of</font>

1779
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:10,250
informational dogs that that describe

1780
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:15,500
these properties more precisely more

1781
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:17,090
formally aaron aaron falk uh so<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1782
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:18,800
conversation makes me think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

1783
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:20,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much more general topic</font>

1784
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,690
than just this working group right yes I

1785
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:26,060
said yes at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> D kgs observation that</font>

1786
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:29,240
you know that this is shared in the in

1787
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:31,790
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> human</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rights research group so I</font>

1788
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:33,920
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe this is a reasonable</font>

1789
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:36,490
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to bubble up to the IAB</font>

1790
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:39,020
because this is this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> related to the</font>

1791
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:41,900
you know this strategic interest in

1792
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:45,440
privacy and pervasive encryption and and

1793
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:49,190
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually probably one of the more</font>

1794
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:51,169
useful dimensions of it from an IT

1795
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:54,679
perspective which is to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

1796
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:58,580
guidance to working groups on on a link

1797
01:13:54,680 --> 01:14:01,430
ability and and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what what's the</font>

1798
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:03,590
toolkit and what are the what are some

1799
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:05,570
candidate requirements that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a protocol</font>

1800
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:08,600
developers might want to include cool

1801
01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:11,660
mirrior to put you on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the spot could you</font>

1802
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:15,170
get this onto the security areas radar

1803
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:18,950
screen in the iesg wrap up discussions

1804
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:21,110
from this week please she said yes which

1805
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:22,610
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> which means Mirror Mirror either</font>

1806
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:27,170
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the iesg meeting or talk of</font>

1807
01:14:22,610 --> 01:14:32,000
Kathleen in private all right that's it

1808
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:35,690
any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1809
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:44,780
long discussion but probably in good

1810
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:48,110
shape yeah I think that's it any other

1811
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:50,300
comments questions dead cats rotten

1812
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:53,000
tomatoes that was a shockingly short

1813
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:55,820
session lots of really good songs like

1814
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,620
um thinking about what happened here

1815
01:14:55,820 --> 01:15:00,710
more importantly what didn't happen here

1816
01:14:57,620 --> 01:15:02,870
i think i agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with nebula who said</font>

1817
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:04,790
this this really does feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

1818
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:06,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">we are at the point where we r group</font>

1819
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:09,740
last call is the next step and the

1820
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:12,680
drafts are ready so many thanks to all

1821
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:14,240
the hard work<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the team from the</font>

1822
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:16,310
team<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's working on the giraffes and</font>

1823
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:19,849
i think i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this this is i think</font>

1824
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:21,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is really good the the i think just</font>

1825
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:24,620
I just didn't estimate my head I think

1826
