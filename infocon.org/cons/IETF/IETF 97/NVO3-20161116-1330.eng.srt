21
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first 40 minutes or so will run like</font>

22
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,640
a normal normal IDF working group

23
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,359
meeting so we have a few short

24
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,220
presentations during that time the final

25
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">50 minutes will be taken up with some</font>

26
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,000
round round table discussion sessions we

27
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,359
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any round tables</font>

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,250
unfortunately but I've so some topics of

29
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,940
importance to the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group we have</font>

30
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,800
some big flip charts that will bring out

31
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,350
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure sure yet exactly how to</font>

32
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,930
to best run this session so this will be

33
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,280
an experiment and we've got a second

34
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,110
session on Thursday that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we used to</font>

35
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,160
report<font color="#E5E5E5"> back on on these sessions I'll</font>

36
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,870
talk a little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

37
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,579
sessions in a moment okay joined the

38
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:31,850
bashing so here's the proposed agenda

39
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,850
for today any comments on the agenda

40
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,970
thank you and here's the agenda for

41
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:44,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">tomorrow so we'll have a bit what we've</font>

42
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,780
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we split the agenda between for</font>

43
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,010
the presentations between the VX<font color="#E5E5E5"> LAN</font>

44
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:52,640
related stuff today and OEM related

45
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,640
stuff tomorrow

46
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:01,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay milestones so we need to update the</font>

47
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,700
milestones these are the milestone

48
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,550
proposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> much changes to the milestones</font>

49
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:10,269
that we discussed in the virtual interim

50
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:12,760
meeting a couple of weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and if</font>

51
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:18,180
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> no comments on these then</font>

52
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:20,800
we'll make the changes after this ITF I

53
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,300
guess the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> major change is to remove</font>

54
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">the security requirements milestone</font>

55
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,240
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think those consensus in the</font>

56
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,469
working group to<font color="#E5E5E5"> split security</font>

57
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,060
requirements and the implications for

58
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,680
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the individual solution</font>

59
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,390
drafts and address<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in assertions</font>

60
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:40,690
drafts as part of their security

61
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:42,070
considerations so we had a virtual

62
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:48,900
interim meeting on the twenty-sixth of

63
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:55,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">October and that was really yeah I think</font>

64
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:56,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that yeah we had a</font>

65
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,500
virtual interim meeting on the

66
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:01,360
twenty-sixth of<font color="#CCCCCC"> October and that was</font>

67
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,520
primarily around discussing the next

68
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,260
state steps in the data plane design and

69
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,880
how we were going to progress the

70
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,969
current situation where we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

71
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,409
data plane encapsulation drafts with

72
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:15,280
very little technical progress being

73
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:18,010
made on on each one of them so we've

74
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,049
drawn to the design team to take one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

75
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,599
these three<font color="#CCCCCC"> three existing end caps and</font>

76
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:24,640
enhance it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address concerns that were</font>

77
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,430
discussed on the list we be posted some

78
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,320
questions to the list about people could

79
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,110
post their technical concerns about each

80
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:35,140
of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> three drafts and the output of</font>

81
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:38,410
that will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a standard track draft for</font>

82
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,240
adoption by the working group given that

83
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,860
will be progressed as standards track we

84
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,510
would probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the existing three</font>

85
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,900
drafts being forwarded as informational

86
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,640
after the publication of these of the MV

87
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">03</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next-gen and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next-generation</font>

88
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:55,919
encapsulation and<font color="#CCCCCC"> which we would view</font>

89
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:58,450
that single encapsulation as being the

90
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,030
one the working group in the industry no

91
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:02,740
longer term can converge around the

92
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,650
future it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop of course people</font>

93
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">implementing and building the</font>

94
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,830
informational encapsulations in the

95
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:10,479
meantime or progressing those<font color="#E5E5E5"> drafts and</font>

96
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,698
improving on

97
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:17,119
and we posted<font color="#CCCCCC"> a charter to the list so</font>

98
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:19,459
the Charter was was discussed in the so

99
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:28,779
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very smaller text pls pc the list</font>

100
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:33,079
for her for the full charter<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay</font>

101
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:35,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">document status so we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two RFC's no</font>

102
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:38,029
new RFC since the last ITF we have one

103
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:41,679
in the RFC editors<font color="#E5E5E5"> q which is the</font>

104
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:49,939
architecture document thank you all 48

105
00:06:41,679 --> 00:06:51,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">tie great even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a set of</font>

106
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:54,079
requirements drafts<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think as we've</font>

107
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:56,239
stated in numerous times in the past we

108
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,679
plan to regresar requirements in

109
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:59,119
parallel with any applicable solutions

110
00:06:57,679 --> 00:07:01,399
rather than publishing them first so if

111
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:04,339
there's interesting in publishing these

112
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:06,529
you know when when the when any

113
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:08,629
solutions are published that's that's

114
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:10,609
fine but we won't push the working group

115
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:16,369
to to push those out any earlier than

116
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:17,929
that we have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of drafts that</font>

117
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:21,589
have gone through last call and we

118
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:23,568
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to send those to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier so</font>

119
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:26,059
I'm afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's as myself and Sam that</font>

120
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:28,339
are tasked with doing the write ups that

121
00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:31,459
there's the multicast framework and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

122
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:34,809
use cases draft so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will we promise to</font>

123
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:41,989
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> these done after after this I GF</font>

124
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:43,519
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay as I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have these</font>

125
00:07:41,989 --> 00:07:44,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">three working group documents on data</font>

126
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,999
plan encapsulations and what I propose

127
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:50,149
is that we kind of kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> park</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

128
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:53,749
from a working group perspective for the

129
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:56,419
time being<font color="#CCCCCC"> until the design team has</font>

130
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:58,219
done its work it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean to say you</font>

131
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:59,688
can't work on these but we won't really

132
00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:01,489
entertain them being presented in

133
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:03,829
meetings and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really intern any</font>

134
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:06,039
change in status of them for the time

135
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:06,039
being

136
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:17,650
okay finally roundtable session so after

137
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:20,560
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had the three presentations this</font>

138
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:22,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">afternoon we will what we're going to do</font>

139
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,810
is bring out some flip charts and we

140
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:26,948
have some facilitators who will help us

141
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:31,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we'd like to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to break up into</font>

142
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:36,700
groups and to discuss these these three

143
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:39,370
topics so Pat and Greg and Benson kindly

144
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:42,250
offered to help facilitate<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

145
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:45,550
sessions and we've broken this down<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

146
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:48,520
three high-level topics OEM control

147
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:52,180
plane and data plane now there were a

148
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,850
set of detailed questions posted to the

149
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,790
list and what we'd like you to do is to

150
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about how to answer some of the</font>

151
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,490
how to address some of these topics<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

152
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,680
terms of answering the questions that

153
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,480
were posted to the list so around OEM

154
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,859
for example what's really important for

155
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:11,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">the encapsulation design there are any</font>

156
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,440
specific requirements on encapsulation

157
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:15,790
and the control plane coming from OEM

158
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,650
I'm all kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of visibility is required</font>

159
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">end-to-end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the in the MV 03</font>

160
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,949
architecture that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's at all</font>

161
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,709
points in points and end points in the

162
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,180
architecture<font color="#CCCCCC"> the control plane what kind</font>

163
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:28,410
of standardization worked we really need

164
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:30,459
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do in the DMV to mva control plane a</font>

165
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,140
management plane and one of the protocol

166
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:33,279
options since there hasn't been a huge

167
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,319
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of discussion around what our</font>

168
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,200
protocol options really are for some

169
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,940
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the working group what's needed</font>

170
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,020
from young models versus dynamic control

171
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:46,680
protocols now there are also some

172
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,670
questions around the use of a VPN

173
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,729
together with VX LAN and the

174
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:55,390
implications of that on om or the

175
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,770
suitability of a VPN versus centralized

176
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">control planes and so on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on will be</font>

177
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,459
posted to the list so questions like

178
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,930
that could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used to just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hit the</font>

179
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:06,459
discussion finally data plane so we

180
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,430
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a lot</font>

181
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:11,920
of discussion on the list on the the

182
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,599
extensions that might be needed for an

183
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,279
env 03 encapsulation what kind of

184
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,740
options would be required and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font>

185
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,450
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of concern i think around do all</font>

186
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,380
these you know the visibility of these

187
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,950
and impact of these on nodes in the

188
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,930
network

189
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:28,600
elements in the network endpoints and

190
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:31,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">midpoints and what kind of parsing is</font>

191
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,740
required and processing is required at

192
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:35,440
those points for the encapsulation and

193
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:39,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the impact of having potentially large</font>

194
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,650
large different numbers of options for

195
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,740
extensibility in the encapsulation on

196
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:47,340
implementation so likes you think about

197
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:49,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">really what the what's really required</font>

198
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,730
rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really a lengthy to wishlist</font>

199
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:54,160
trying to narrow this down a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit and</font>

200
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:59,190
again that topics covered in some of the

201
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:05,620
detailed questions on the on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list</font>

202
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:07,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yep on the data plan specifically</font>

203
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:11,020
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already have a design team we</font>

204
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,910
would definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> love to hear any of the</font>

205
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:15,819
requirements which the working group

206
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:18,790
would like to have them part of the

207
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,460
design team design of the gutter<font color="#E5E5E5"> plane</font>

208
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:32,620
end cap so we would definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> love to</font>

209
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:34,410
hear any of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that data points okay so</font>

210
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:52,770
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> first up we have an update on</font>

211
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:56,140
very pay from her Pat Taylor with my

212
00:11:52,770 --> 00:12:01,650
chair of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the I Triple E 802 dot one data</font>

213
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:05,439
center bridging group<font color="#CCCCCC"> hat on um okay um</font>

214
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:07,959
so we've got a draft uh it's a very

215
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,570
early<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft please understand that when</font>

216
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:13,650
you look at it but because basically

217
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:16,780
what we're doing is adding extending our

218
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:21,120
existing TL<font color="#CCCCCC"> v's to cover the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs</font>

219
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:23,589
of of<font color="#CCCCCC"> MV 03 we really felt we needed</font>

220
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,760
early feedback on whether we've got the

221
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:29,050
right fields on and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> um and whether</font>

222
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,110
that looks like that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to fill the</font>

223
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:34,540
need whether we need to adjust anything

224
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:36,790
so we're making this available it's a

225
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,610
point 0 for draft it's a task group

226
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,899
draft it's not

227
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:47,570
for working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

228
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:51,079
considered complete or so we basically

229
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:53,089
because of the I Triple E way we handle

230
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:55,729
drafts it needs to be protected under<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

231
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:58,339
password so your chairs have the

232
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:02,029
password and username that you need to

233
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:03,260
get to it and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like to take</font>

234
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:07,010
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at that draft and I'd really</font>

235
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:10,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">appreciate if you would please ask your</font>

236
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:13,189
chair for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the password</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and use your</font>

237
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:15,410
name we don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to be out on the</font>

238
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:17,410
public internet so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't send it on</font>

239
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:26,149
the reflector so it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be handled</font>

240
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:30,439
via emails and it's it's an amendment to

241
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:32,510
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> triple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a standard 802 dot1q 2014</font>

242
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:36,740
that's that's where you'll find the base

243
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:39,319
text that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's amending and when our</font>

244
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:42,160
standards have been out for at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

245
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:45,410
months they're available for free from

246
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:48,160
on the get 802 website so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you google</font>

247
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:50,630
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80 to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that'll bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you to a website</font>

248
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,250
where you can get the base standard just

249
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:55,540
in case you you want to reference that

250
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:58,190
if you have any<font color="#CCCCCC"> trouble getting to it</font>

251
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:01,250
send me an email<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm on the list and I</font>

252
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:05,089
can respond with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> website okay or</font>

253
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:07,070
actually there's a URL there too um and

254
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:11,029
so something we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be dealing</font>

255
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:13,399
with working on in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next go round of</font>

256
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:16,339
the draft is is terminology because

257
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:18,920
right now VDP<font color="#CCCCCC"> is written kind of with</font>

258
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:20,720
reference to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ports that we have an</font>

259
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,800
edge virtual bridging and so we're going

260
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:30,010
to need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide kind of a translation</font>

261
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:34,010
of of when you're using VDP<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4n do three</font>

262
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:37,490
this port sits in the place of that put

263
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:39,910
so this diagram shows you you know we

264
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:46,670
have what we call an uplink port and

265
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:49,990
that would be the the NN v facing side

266
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,990
of the tien ve

267
00:14:51,070 --> 00:15:00,080
our editors weren't able to find a port

268
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:02,120
names for those so for for that we have

269
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,100
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of special names for all our ports</font>

270
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:09,050
so we can say it's the sport of that

271
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:11,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">portent with the NV e</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> t MBE and NM v we</font>

272
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:13,370
didn't we didn't see all of those

273
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">defined so we'll be working on the</font>

274
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:19,910
terminology and trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it so it's</font>

275
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,959
as equivalent as possible though it's

276
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:23,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably not possible to get it</font>

277
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,719
perfectly equivalent but just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we can</font>

278
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,670
describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> how this this this tlv is used</font>

279
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,490
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> T alvey's are used when you're</font>

280
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:35,689
using them with with em bees instead of

281
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:44,209
with edge virtual bridges<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

282
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:47,270
that's it any questions can we do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font>

283
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:49,609
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask who's</font>

284
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:51,230
planning to review the draft yeah so can

285
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:55,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">we get some idea of who's interested in</font>

286
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:57,470
reviewing viewing this draft Benson<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

287
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,089
any others will be good to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some</font>

288
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,279
review of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this yeah yeah I'd like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

289
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:05,839
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> summer view otherwise it's not</font>

290
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:12,110
clear why it's worth doing it so and

291

300
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:07,349
BFD for VX lon we've done some editorial

301
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,329
changes we change terminology because

302
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:17,020
what is proposed in the document to use

303
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:21,339
a mac for the inner and ethernet frame

304
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:23,709
and first it was referred as a

305
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:28,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">well-known which is probably not the</font>

306
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:32,890
best term and because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are requesting</font>

307
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:39,669
iono to allocate it so now it's referred

308
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:42,450
as dedicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> mac another change that you</font>

309
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:46,030
will notice and in this version is that

310
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:51,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">we had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> previously text that started</font>

discussion on BFD in the excellent GP in

312
00:17:51,900 --> 00:18:00,160
encapsulation and as we started

313
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:02,590
enhancing or detailing this will realize

314
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:07,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it probably deserves its own</font>

315
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:11,409
consideration and then offers decided to

316
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:13,960
take this discussion out of this

317
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:17,830
