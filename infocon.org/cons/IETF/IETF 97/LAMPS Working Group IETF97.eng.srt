1
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,969
ok

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,389
first thing is this is the lamp screw

3
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:25,400
remind everyone about the note well if

4
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:33,379
you cannot abide by the note well please

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:38,839
leave the room this is the agenda it is

6
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:42,579
as was negotiated on the mail list there

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:47,539
is one slide deck for B<font color="#CCCCCC"> and C together</font>

8
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:52,460
2b and 2c for those of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you who are</font>

9
00:00:47,539 --> 00:01:01,359
downloading the slides to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptop is</font>

10
00:00:52,460 --> 00:01:01,359
there any in the room agenda bash<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

11
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:18,229
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will begin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whose is Alexi or way</font>

12
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:20,750
giving the presentation neither ones in

13
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:23,330
the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right we will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start with</font>

14
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,670
Jim and come back to them hoping that

15
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:28,150
they're in one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the long elevator</font>

16
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,150
queues

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:52,350
I told my last meeting I was presenting

18
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:59,309
first I guess was right um<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next</font>

19
00:01:52,350 --> 00:02:02,880
sector so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've managed to get</font>

20
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,160
through almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that needs to</font>

21
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,970
be done for<font color="#CCCCCC"> these documents there's just</font>

22
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:12,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">a couple of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that I wanted to</font>

23
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:15,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">double-check consensus on as it were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

24
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:19,530
first is there was a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

25
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:23,220
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to list aes 192 in the mandatory</font>

26
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:27,690
well in in the in the explicit must

27
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:29,880
should may list i think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i saw</font>

28
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,250
enough people who were against that

29
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:36,480
position to say that the consensus of

30
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,430
the mailing list was not to do so if

31
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:45,048
anyone believes that is wrong they need

32
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:51,000
to let me know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i inserted text on</font>

33
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:53,700
deterministic ecdsa which I think said

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,320
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it if you have it because it's much</font>

35
00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:03,298
much better if anyone objects to that

36
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:06,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">text um please do so otherwise it will</font>

37
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:10,410
stay so Jim what I think the text says

38
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:13,049
is that signers should use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but</font>

39
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:18,750
validators can't tell whether the signer

40
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:21,720
used it or not right um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not too sure</font>

41
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:25,290
it says the second okay that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a true</font>

42
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:31,650
statement because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really a should</font>

43
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:33,298
use it to signers yes okay right if you

44
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,989
can figure out how to how to check on

45
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:39,350
the recent receiving<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'll give you a</font>

46
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:39,350
math prize

47
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:55,360
somebody asked for inclusion of p38 for

48
00:03:52,130 --> 00:04:01,540
as they should in the document on the

49
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:05,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">basis that there's a large amount of</font>

50
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:07,880
government and commercial people who end

51
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:12,370
up needing this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a sweet</font>

52
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:14,990
be protocol I have pushed back on this

53
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:17,540
using much the same logic that I put

54
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:21,769
that was used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> push back on aes 192</font>

55
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:25,580
which is yes is there but it's not

56
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:28,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">really something that we're saying is if</font>

57
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:33,950
it's as you know that let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me rephrase</font>

58
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:36,650
this doing so would tend to bless a

59
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:41,020
government position and that's not an

60
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:44,750
ietf thing and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me that</font>

61
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:47,810
there is a reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put this in the</font>

62
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,840
document as the industries that need it

63
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:54,220
will push on provide on providers of

64
00:04:50,840 --> 00:05:01,880
email clients to provide it anyway I

65
00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:03,880
think that's what I want to say um<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

66
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,190
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone want to say anything</font>

67
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:10,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting at this point in time so on</font>

68
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:12,290
the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will start with the chair so</font>

69
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:16,340
on the list I've been the one advocating

70
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:18,380
it does is there anyone else in the room

71
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:26,719
who supports the inclusion of it as a

72
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:32,180
should level requirement hi I'm Debbie

73
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:36,919
Cooley so as the yeah and I say consumer

74
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:39,830
lower the mic can't doesn't move um it's

75
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:48,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not calling it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> C NSA by</font>

76
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:50,960
the way not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sweeping um true so we would</font>

77
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:52,760
like it did you can we can we now call

78
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,219
it the keep dump Trump out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

79
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,219
business<font color="#CCCCCC"> like them so what no</font>

80
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:11,840
no um so we would like it but if you

81
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:17,190
don't see fit to put it in then huh

82
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:19,138
you're right go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sean do it so um I</font>

83
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,270
guess Shawn Turner I guess it just seems

84
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,849
odd that we do have this group of people

85
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:26,159
who might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the largest users of this</font>

86
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:28,770
and you're saying now like don't put it

87
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:30,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">in there it just seems weird I mean</font>

88
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,758
they've got a profile so technically you

89
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:34,050
could leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out and say yeah no we</font>

90
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,789
don't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not part of the base</font>

91
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,199
standard and then you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

92
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:38,789
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that need to go by and go whack</font>

93
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,389
them but it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> really weird that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

94
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:44,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really it's I mean it's usg</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

95
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:45,479
other people in Europe I mean there's

96
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:47,750
people in other continents it's not just

97
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:53,610
us G so it seems weird that you would

98
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:54,930
not at least mention this somehow and so

99
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:59,969
we've said not to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other one</font>

100
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:02,940
right the smaller one now what we waitin

101
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:04,979
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with how much smaller so P 256 is</font>

102
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:09,539
sort of off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list right not to 52</font>

103
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:11,250
page 256 is a must<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

104
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:16,229
most so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> would really like it if it</font>

105
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:17,819
was released<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one sir</font>

106
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:25,758
anyone else that wants to speak for or

107
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:25,759
against Tim lunch after being silent

108
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:39,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um I will confer with we will</font>

109
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:44,330
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to the lynches um last one is</font>

110
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:47,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">Shaw 30 at this point in time I'm seeing</font>

111
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:50,758
zero real support in the IETF for doing

112
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:55,139
sha-3 on anything and I'm perfectly

113
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:58,770
willing to stay with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that position for</font>

114
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:03,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">this document is there anyone who thinks</font>

115
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,169
that's a bad position

116
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:23,360
not seeing anyone run to the mic to say

117
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:25,880
otherwise<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so from that list there</font>

118
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,070
that basically says we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got one thing</font>

119
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:34,130
to stop to decide and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything else</font>

120
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:37,010
stays put okay so work left I need to

121
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:39,830
add a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> short paragraph on padding</font>

122
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:43,610
which says you know you may want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

123
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:48,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about it but it's not probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

124
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:52,279
huge issue for us mime<font color="#E5E5E5"> and per se and I</font>

125
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:56,390
need to regenerate examples and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

126
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:59,990
get some verra verification of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

127
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:01,490
debating<font color="#E5E5E5"> just stealing some Paul Hoffman</font>

128
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,200
examples for everything's that the

129
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:07,760
authenticated date is so that's the only

130
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:10,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">1i have to generate from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scratch if</font>

131
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,160
anyone think that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bad idea let me</font>

132
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,670
know if anyone is willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

133
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:20,089
validation of these things let me know

134
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,920
off list so i can send<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to you and</font>

135
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:24,200
say they're right i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think i can probably</font>

136
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">get Peter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gottman to do validations but</font>

137
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,709
not positive yet so are these examples

138
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:30,260
that you're putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this draft or</font>

139
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:33,140
examples you're putting in the 158 page

140
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:35,089
s prime examples draft these are

141

okay said okay I'm done okay Alexei

145
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,260
No

146
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:25,540
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing very quick update on the</font>

147
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:32,709
internationalized email addresses in pic

148
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:36,219
certificates my co-editor did a very

149
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:40,000
good job he did two updates basically we

150
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:43,810
received I think three reviews one from

151
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,040
Ross one from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shawn and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one from gym or</font>

152
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:53,170
something like that I believe all of the

153
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:59,560
comments were addressed basically

154
00:10:53,170 --> 00:11:03,130
clarification on where the new other

155
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:06,189
name form is allowed in issuer out name

156
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:09,610
so it is allowed without there was no

157
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:13,330
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> to disallow it disallow wildcard</font>

158
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:15,010
characters some clarification on

159
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:19,690
encoding<font color="#E5E5E5"> byte order mark character</font>

160
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:23,020
unicode characters disallowed a sin one

161
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:25,240
module some oils for temporarily

162
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,210
allocated and then deallocate it and

163
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:34,540
that TBD so this will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a result by</font>

164
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:39,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">anna so i want to say one thing on that</font>

165
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:41,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">point the other name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Boyd way just put</font>

166
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:45,460
it the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> available one into the</font>

167
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:48,010
internet draft so since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I happen to be</font>

168
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,440
the iono expert on that registry I

169
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:52,270
actually made that allocation so that if

170
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone implements from the internet</font>

171
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:57,250
draft or the RC they'll be implementing

172
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,280
the same code point I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'd be</font>

173
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:03,580
really bad if that changed yeah but it

174
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:07,150
should have been a DVD but he didn't do

175
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:10,240
that and so I right I saved us from from

176
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:13,360
potential early implementers doing the

177
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,300
wrong thing yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think thank you for</font>

178
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,580
that I did it<font color="#CCCCCC"> explained offline to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way</font>

179
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:26,050
that I on allocations typically happens

180
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:28,480
later but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know yeah I think you can</font>

181
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,870
show the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide which basically says</font>

182
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,529
I

183
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:34,660
think we're done I don't know of any

184
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:37,350
open issues there is no TBD in the

185
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:45,160
document as far as I remember does

186
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:48,880
anyone want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to raise any new issues does</font>

187
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:54,339
anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this document is not ready</font>

188
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:56,230
for working group last call<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay then by</font>

189
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:58,510
the end of the week I will begin<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

190
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,810
two-week working group last call thank

191
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,810
you

192
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:14,050
Sean so I guess just for completeness I

193
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:16,540
guess PhD in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chatroom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did say that</font>

194
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:20,050
he thought not including shot<font color="#CCCCCC"> three and</font>

195
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:23,469
the S Mon specs is a bad idea so this

196
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,969
one day he thought we should include

197
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,579
 include I think what he's saying

198
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,640
which should include sha-3 so right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

199
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:35,649
just want to wait that out with which

200
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:37,000
signature algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right hi my</font>

201
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:41,529
name is Shawn Turner and I'm in the pink

202
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,899
box so why am I here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I asked even</font>

203
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">Farrell 280 sponsor this draft and he</font>

204
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:48,760
said that's awesome please go get some

205
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:51,310
comments go to lamps so here I am next

206
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,839
all the links actually go to things so

207
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,939
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> est right so he is T is an</font>

208
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,130
enrollment over secure transport it's

209
00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:02,500
the last RFC that came out of P Kix

210
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:05,769
leave the joke up there basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

211
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:08,470
idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow people to do enrollment</font>

212
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:10,149
and get certs and you know server

213
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:12,279
generated certificates over an HTTPS

214
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:14,589
connection and it's getting posts and

215
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:16,089
it's just a collection of this is one

216
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:17,829
for CA certs there's one for doing

217
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:20,110
simple enrollment which is the tens and

218
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:21,579
sevens simple rien<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolls the same thing</font>

219
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,240
server key gen allows you to generate

220
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:27,279
ask the server to generate you a

221
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,079
public/private key pair full CMC which

222
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,120
is another interface to do you know the

223
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:33,189
full CMC dance that you could do and

224
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,089
then there's csr attributes which was

225
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:40,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">added to allow the the EST server to</font>

226
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:42,130
provide something to the client they can

227
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:44,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">then use to include in one of the</font>

228
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:46,269
enrollment requests so an example of

229
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,730
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> is https you know</font>

230
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:51,699
example.com well known / EST<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

231
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:55,779
like this the service name so what do I

232
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:57,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to do stand all the protocols you</font>

233
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:58,720
give me a framework and I do some stuff

234
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,640
so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> extend it the key point</font>

235
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,800
here is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an extension it's not it</font>

236
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,209
updates I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every EST</font>

237
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,160
server that's out on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the planet there</font>

238
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:08,439
are a few need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of these things</font>

239
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,899
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just some additional services and</font>

240
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,100
some people could adopt them so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

241
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:14,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually talked with some people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan</font>

242
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,940
Harkins is not here he he thought some

243
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,649
of it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little interesting some of</font>

244
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,329
it actually implemented in Yokohama like

245
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:21,879
on the fly fairly quickly so that

246
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:24,040
nice and panels at Cisco I guess I also

247
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,989
talks to unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> I butcher his</font>

248
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,248
last name so I won't try it he said some

249
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:30,939
of it was good and<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that he meant</font>

250
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:32,470
me so I'm completely understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

251
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:34,569
all the services are universally loved

252
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,399
by everybody but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

253
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:37,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">them enough of them together I got</font>

254
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,279
enough use cases that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could be used</font>

255
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:44,199
so next so first thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do is</font>

256
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:46,360
extend the existing server key gen in

257
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:48,128
three ways the first thing I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

258
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,069
is that there are some additional CMS

259
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:53,350
content types that allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to return</font>

260
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:54,790
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow you rap rap key packages in</font>

261
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,889
additional thing so one of them

262
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,480
essentially is right now you could do

263
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:01,449
naked which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is essentially just returned</font>

264
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,009
a naked key over TLS which is good for

265
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:05,319
most scenarios but not for those that

266
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:06,730
are slightly more paranoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> um the next</font>

267
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:09,009
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can use cryptid dated</font>

268
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:12,369
or envelope data well there's this RC

269
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:13,569
760 32 which is encrypted key package so

270
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:15,160
that's useful if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this</font>

271
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:16,959
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CMS content constraints</font>

272
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,249
which you can put in a certificate to

273
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,410
limit the person that's allowed to

274
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:22,389
authorize or originate these packages

275
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,779
what they can do so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is that you</font>

276
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:27,899
would like essentially link the two um

277
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:31,689
the next thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that actually um</font>

278
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:33,189
because we also have a way to return

279
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:34,599
receipts and errors we'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

280
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:36,129
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to return these back to the</font>

281
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,559
server so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that when you give</font>

282
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">them a package you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can say you know</font>

283
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,919
please return this receipt with an

284
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:45,488
attribute if there's an error okay guess

285
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:47,829
what you post back the procedure air and

286
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:49,720
you do that with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a post and I had to</font>

287
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:51,160
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a way to someplace to put</font>

288
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,559
this so essentially what i did was i

289
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,439
extended the syntax from server key gen

290
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:58,569
to someplace called return so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

291
00:16:56,439 --> 00:17:00,248
generic because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's post receipts and</font>

292
00:16:58,569 --> 00:17:01,959
errors<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could have had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one for each but</font>

293
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:05,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">i figured since it's one thing it's a</font>

294
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:07,388
post you would just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go there um and the</font>

295
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,919
one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that both</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think dan and</font>

296
00:17:07,388 --> 00:17:11,379
panels like was actually returning at

297
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:12,939
the kcs 12 we love that everyone would

298
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,730
use the standard formats that we came up

299
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:18,189
with but keep pkcs12 is still used and

300
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,510
so we're just going with the flow it's

301
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:22,990
just add another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that actually be</font>

302
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:24,309
used so you know we tried our best and

303
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,529
everybody was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey that's really</font>

304
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:29,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">great but p12 is kind of what gets used</font>

305
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:33,180
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm giving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up so next</font>

306
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,949
and then all of the new services so the

307
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea essentially is this pal thing and</font>

308
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,450
this is where I'm going to duck it's an

309
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:41,610
XML formatted file that essentially is a

310
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,590
flat file with a bunch of entries that

311
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,870
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> included there's a iono registered</font>

312
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:48,720
type there's a name for the thing

313
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:50,969
there's a pointer in it and a date and a

314
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,040
size and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically you have this file</font>

315
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,900
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just you would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

316
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,550
pointed out it through some a priori

317
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,110
syntax and you would essentially just

318
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,669
walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> through this file to know all the</font>

319
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,800
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get so the first thing you</font>

320
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,660
would get is like your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ca certs then you</font>

321
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,700
can maybe get firmware tamp stuff if

322
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,200
that wasn't interested um then you could

323
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,060
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some CR</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> l's and then they get some</font>

324
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,990
skit do your enrollment and you can do

325
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,280
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things and at the end of the</font>

326
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,140
day after you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> walked this whole file</font>

327
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,300
you're ready to go you're pretty much

328
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,100
ginned up and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

329
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,780
communicating your flight guess what the

330
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,070
next step is so there might be some

331
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,540
other way to do this but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

332
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,600
part the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dan implemented kind of on the</font>

333
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:26,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">fly fairly quickly so distribute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

334
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,800
some slides later if we have time which

335
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,530
we might or if you're bored we can just

336
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,960
skip<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and you can read them later um</font>

337
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:35,790
distribute certs so this this service

338
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,410
would allow you to essentially say hey I

339
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:40,020
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these devices are really only</font>

340
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,700
to talk to a couple of people so just

341
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,410
distribute certs that you know that the

342
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,790
device is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually going to talk to so</font>

343
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,380
say you're setting up a thing in a house

344
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,659
or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's only going to talk</font>

345
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,070
to for other things you could give it

346
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,600
those for cert so it doesn't have to go

347
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,010
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them later it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

348
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,540
already got<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so when it goes to</font>

349
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:58,530
communicate it can use that it can use

350
00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:00,149
them to just verify or decrypt stuff crl

351
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,480
zan day or else<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know there's a way</font>

352
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:05,070
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do that that you can just</font>

353
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">straight up pull the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CR l's and arrows</font>

354
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,260
from cas but you could also<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use</font>

355
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:11,669
this mechanism to distribute um

356
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:13,860
symmetric keys again it's another key

357
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:15,720
format that we defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the IHF and</font>

358
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,419
the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hey it might be good to</font>

359
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,550
actually you be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this est</font>

360
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:23,160
thing to distribute them so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is</font>

361
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:24,419
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially the the client would</font>

362
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,590
connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the server and the server</font>

363
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,480
would say hey look here all these

364
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:30,209
symmetric keys that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

365
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,950
bama would download them and again it's

366
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,360
CMS wrap then you can encrypt sign

367
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,890
there's a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of you know</font>

368
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,419
various ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can wrap these</font>

369
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,670
things to provide various levels of

370
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,410
security none if you want or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole</font>

371
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:43,230
bunch and then we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into more fun ones</font>

372
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,620
like firm or it is an RFC standard there

373
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,120
are acts

374
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,110
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the ideas</font>

375
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,149
that we'd like to be able to support

376
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:50,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">those people that could use it tamps</font>

377
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:52,140
another one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of course all of</font>

378
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:55,020
these things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we you know require</font>

379
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,430
that my<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF protocols do like return</font>

380
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,780
receipts and errors we included those

381
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,190
and for completeness we're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

382
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so we need to be able to support</font>

383
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:05,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">returning those so that's where this you</font>

384
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:06,629
know service name / return with posts so

385
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,280
the difference is all the ones on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

386
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:11,670
left or gets the ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the writer</font>

387
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:14,510
posts<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sean yes yesterday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had an</font>

388
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:18,360
interesting discussion and TLS about

389
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:22,800
some groups in data centers that might

390
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:24,449
use preacher keys so is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> symmetric</font>

391
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,809
keys thing appropriate to solve that

392
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:30,090
problem or is it orthogonal it could be

393
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,440
used so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is if they were to set</font>

394
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,629
up their servers to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to go pull</font>

395
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,940
this thing you could you could see that

396
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:40,290
that could be a solution interesting and

397
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,429
back up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just kind of more if</font>

398
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,690
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to go to the next slide it just</font>

399
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:45,360
shows you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the format of the pal and</font>

400
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:47,309
again I duck because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML but it's</font>

401
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically you know it's a pal with a</font>

402
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:51,300
bunch of messages it's got a type and

403
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,379
it's from an eye on a registered thing

404
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,550
which is we have on the right and

405
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,690
there's a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of them so we kind</font>

406
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:58,110
of broke it down the ones that i've been

407
00:20:54,690 --> 00:21:00,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">using um you know because the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PAL could</font>

408
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,469
be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a million long maybe you don't</font>

409
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,790
want it a million long you can clip it

410
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,370
and make it short so you can have one

411
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:07,080
pal point to another pal and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then all</font>

412
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:09,449
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it might do you have a</font>

413
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,800
date format the size of the thing and

414
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">then some info about the actual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

415
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pulling down it's just a</font>

416
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,530
format for amazing but it's like a

417
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:19,678
manifest basically yeah that's probably

418
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:22,500
a better name for it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it commonly used</font>

419
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:26,340
somewhere or is it commonly used there

420
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:29,610
are people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using it yes and as</font>

421
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:31,678
in you didn't invent it I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh okay</font>

422
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:37,290
well I mean yes I invented it but no

423
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:38,490
it's yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a manifest basically it's</font>

424
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,440
not it there's not a standardized

425
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,809
manifest format but it is a what you

426
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to use Jason yeah so I need</font>

427
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:45,178
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say so I knew somebody was gonna ask</font>

428
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,660
me that yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's where all the</font>

429
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:50,900
cool kids are doing now um I'm not

430
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:53,360
apparently I'm not she bore and again

431
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:56,570
I'm not cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm getting older um</font>

432
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,158
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in XML this is obviously not</font>

433
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">his thing on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the planet and my kind of</font>

434
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,669
theory is that I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do XML and so</font>

435
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:04,120
if other people want to do JSON that's

436
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:08,840
great if somebody can tell me how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

437
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:10,580
allow both but not require one and allow

438
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,259
the client to request what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

439
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,928
returned would be great<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if we get</font>

440
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:17,360
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this MTI thing I'm gonna lose my</font>

441
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:20,059
mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to return this</font>

442
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,519
format and if it's JSON or XML I really

443
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:24,500
just don't care or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next thing I just</font>

444
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:26,029
need I need XML there other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people might</font>

445
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,340
like JSON is there see if you know if

446
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:30,799
you know as an art guy you can tell me

447
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:34,639
what the right way to do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is I</font>

448
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:37,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">was just sort of your poking fun yeah</font>

449
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:43,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">just I thought I asked just because I</font>

450
00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:44,928
can I just took because like as I

451
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:49,158
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> read you draft can ask some</font>

452
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:51,139
ignorance so is there a way to discover

453
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:54,559
which one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new ones you support or</font>

454
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:56,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">not or like do you have to support all</font>

455
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,820
of them or so the way I wrote it since

456
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:00,559
there's none of them are required<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

457
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,029
they're all optional so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is that</font>

458
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,559
if you if you didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the pal</font>

459
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:04,970
you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just skip the pally you just</font>

460
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:06,889
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> e search you just add it</font>

461
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:09,289
so you as a client which is know if you

462
00:23:06,889 --> 00:23:10,908
were to go go to connect to it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

463
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:12,559
didn't if you didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to that thing</font>

464
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:14,629
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an error basically so there's no</font>

465
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">way so the client will use one of these</font>

466
00:23:14,629 --> 00:23:20,449
and getting that<font color="#E5E5E5"> roughly how could i get</font>

467
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:22,250
an air flow yeah it's not awesome i mean

468
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:23,360
so there there is some grander schemes

469
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,769
where we could do some like service

470
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,658
discovery kind of thing in a lot stuff

471
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:27,889
that's just a bridge too far i think for

472
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:29,600
basically what i need to do which is

473
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:31,428
like here's some more stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font>

474
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:39,230
get here's a list of things point to it

475
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:41,480
go get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it um you go back to slides</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sean</font>

476
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:47,210
gets skewered by the CMC author huh two

477
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:53,059
slides<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for it started started sure</font>

478
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:56,990
not one so distribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> EE sorts is</font>

479
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:58,940
basically this is get all sorts or get

480
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:00,860
whatever is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just hot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> air yeah whatever</font>

481
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">lean pocket so it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any route it's</font>

482
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,240
not a new directory query mechanism it's

483
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:06,950
a mechanism which the ca who knows a

484
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,360
priori you're going to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to these</font>

485
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,240
people here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some certs that you</font>

486
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,820
might like there they go so it's not

487
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,190
a mechanism to be like hey I need search

488
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,200
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> so-and-so it's the it's the EST</font>

489
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,940
server giving it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give me a set of</font>

490
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,290
sorts that I can sort of my life think

491
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,780
you know there's no publishing there is

492
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:24,909
just yes give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> some bag it's again</font>

493
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:27,460
it's basically exactly that it's a cert

494
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:28,900
bag message because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's CMS right so</font>

495
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">all these are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically except for the</font>

496
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:35,590
xml stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> urls essentially CMS wrap</font>

497
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,290
stuff right um after this meeting i'm

498
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:41,860
going to go to a core meeting core

499
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:47,379
meeting and yes he's showing up in core

500
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:48,939
oh yeah it's not a crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

501
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,100
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i first came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was like whoopee doo</font>

502
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,690
it's just like CMC but you know it's it

503
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,100
does there are some other things that it

504
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,960
does that seem to work and it fits some

505
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,030
other people's deployment models for

506
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,179
cert so so so obviously they're going to

507
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:04,420
want to you know change things at some

508
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:07,600
point to return some other things but

509
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:09,550
obviously they're going to like get out

510
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,649
roll over and die if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feed them xml</font>

511
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:13,210
well that's fine so my theory is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

512
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:15,040
don't so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PAL is the only one that's</font>

513
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:18,940
XML right the rest of<font color="#CCCCCC"> rattle CMS blobs</font>

514
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:21,399
and if again you can tell me how I can

515
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:23,170
query and get xml and they can query and

516
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,929
get json not to be great and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

517
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:29,140
know if you do that based on some oh you

518
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:33,220
can ask for cut you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> undo pal one</font>

519
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:35,830
do pal JSON doing do pal sure you could

520
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:38,350
do action format equal x yes I guess you

521
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:40,449
do that yeah so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do that</font>

522
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:42,219
that'd be great and then just<font color="#CCCCCC"> not like</font>

523
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:43,840
you could actually agree on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> quote</font>

524
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">unquote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> schema but it can't be ischaemic</font>

525
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,559
as it Jason because Jason doesn't have

526
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,820
schema but right but basically a great

527
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:50,678
day<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to refresh</font>

528
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">you bore pebbled a big yeah seaboard</font>

529
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:58,870
JSON whatever will make up a new format

530
00:25:52,660 --> 00:26:01,330
called Sean<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi Sean hey hey shot Sean</font>

531
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:03,459
Leonard um so yeah just too although it

532
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:05,409
sounds like some of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML versus JSON</font>

533
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:10,420
vs zebra or whatever was a little

534
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:13,960
facetious this exact same issue of type

535
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:15,840
negotiation has come up in net comp and

536
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,580
yang and they have an approach of

537
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,020
negotiating internet media type so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

538
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,290
would say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so but you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whether</font>

539
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:27,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">you just use a very similar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> approach</font>

540
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:30,780
HTTP over HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> over HTTP rest conf just</font>

541
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:33,060
use HTTP content negotiation I think

542
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:35,850
it's accept header<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we just say</font>

543
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,470
except and I the format<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh like the</font>

544
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,790
format say cuz that'll work cuz I mean

545
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,200
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a while like I wrote</font>

546
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:41,550
this and was like how the hell<font color="#E5E5E5"> i knew i</font>

547
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,350
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna get zing with this so it's</font>

548
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:45,090
like how do I get out of this box this

549
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:48,000
oh if you guys have a solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font>

550
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,830
go look at him yeah donate annoying

551
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,380
thing from rest<font color="#CCCCCC"> corner phase they sort</font>

552
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:54,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">of said clients needs to support both</font>

553
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:59,100
JSON and XML and so I suppose just one

554
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,870
so I i would rather if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

555
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,540
recommend one you know recommend one

556
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:06,060
don't recommend to all right you know

557
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,860
make 1 130 to implement and everyone is

558
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,120
it's not a must if it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm okay</font>

559
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,429
because there are time so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

560
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel like candy that the box doesn't do</font>

561
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,600
that so that's life<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright cool that is</font>

562
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:18,560
actually really valuable input because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

563
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:25,770
didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do that at all so</font>

564
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:28,590
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not in the charter of lamps but</font>

565
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:32,820
Stephen kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of said go here so Jean</font>

566
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:34,820
came here so what I'm going to do is if

567
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:43,500
you think this work should go forward

568
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:45,270
please send<font color="#E5E5E5"> an email to Stephen it's the</font>

569
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,500
next slide is kind of more of a this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

570
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:48,570
all on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft right so it's an eye</font>

571
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,830
chart so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is you know what</font>

572
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,300
you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> do if you have the pile so</font>

573
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,189
essentially you do a get to get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PAL</font>

574
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,629
and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would just like I said walk</font>

575
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:56,430
through the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing so I just</font>

576
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,600
provides you more information about you

577
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:00,060
know what's in the get and all the

578
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,360
fields and it's it's basically like an

579
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:04,770
eye chart and it's in the draft so all

580
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,570
of this stuff is already<font color="#E5E5E5"> registered</font>

581
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:11,879
there's no new iono registries at all

582
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:14,070
and I stuff it's using know so so the

583
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:18,360
only thing you're doing then is

584
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:20,189
extending the dot well known / honey it

585
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me whether I had to do</font>

586
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:23,730
that via standards track or

587
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,439

that'll be great for to me and Steven

621
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:36,870

either go forward or don't go forward

625
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,918
what so one of the points I guess is

626
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,090
that like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think that I'm with</font>

628
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:48,539
like now would be a good time to hear

629
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,830
that because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the problem with a</font>
