18
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:51,040
this but if you'd be patterned something

19
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:55,869
about this you shouldn't you should tell

20
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,000
about that before going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the agenda</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

21
00:01:55,869 --> 00:02:01,810

31
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:35,209
have an agenda and this has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> post on</font>

32
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:38,929
the on the web page as well we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

33
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:42,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the discussion on the meeting venue</font>

34
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:45,709
selection process and then we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

35
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:49,970
discuss a little bit above<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meeting</font>

36
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:52,580
selection meeting venue selection policy

37
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:56,180
as well which doesn't hasn't had quite

38
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:58,700
as much discussion and progress as the

39
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:02,860
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet but we will go to that as</font>

40
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:05,899
well and just to remind<font color="#E5E5E5"> you of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

41
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,780
basically scope here so we are talking

42
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:11,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what are the policies and</font>

43
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,730
processes of selecting venues we're not

44
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:16,880
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about individual venues</font>

45
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:19,578
themselves so let's not talk about how

46
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,359
good after elections some places in some

47
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:26,209
place isn't but let's look forward on

48
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,810
kind of like seeing what are the

49
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:33,319
policies and processes that are the IETF

50
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:35,389
should use when selecting venues<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

51
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:40,420
there's something you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn nope</font>

52
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:40,420
so I think the first presenter is state

53
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:50,060
full of your lives good morning so who

54
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:54,470
here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room has read the current</font>

55
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:59,030
draft which i believe is dash 02 okay

56
00:03:54,470 --> 00:04:03,170
and who's been tracking the email

57
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:08,840
discussion as uninor<font color="#CCCCCC"> jetta kaz it's been</font>

58
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:11,328
it's still there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right so this</font>

59
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:18,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a concerning changes that will</font>

60
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:21,889
produce dash 0 3 next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

61
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:24,889
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll cover next slide all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so</font>

62
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:26,510
these are these are sorted recent issues

63
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:29,510
might not be a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of them</font>

64
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:32,390
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried to list any of the ones that</font>

65
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:35,539
seem substantive and so for example it

66
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:37,128
was an exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> that renewed this</font>

67
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:39,289
morning concerta

68
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:40,789
running the why are we here paragraph

69
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:44,058
and while that's important by some

70
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:45,649
measures it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the substance of</font>

71
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:48,050
doing the work which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where the</font>

72
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:49,999
interesting controversies are and so

73
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,409
we'll lock that down and and I don't

74
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:54,800
think there's much debate going on about

75
00:04:51,409 --> 00:05:00,259
that but that also was a point of

76
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:04,669
activity the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question of how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give</font>

77
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:08,709
text that provides useful guidance for

78
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:12,709
satisfying a range of food requirements

79
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:15,969
without locking us away from too many

80
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:19,819
venues is a an interesting balancing act

81
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:21,409
the current text in the document tried

82
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:24,439
to navigate that there have been more

83
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:28,849
discussions going on this week and we

84
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:30,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we have what's actually a smaller</font>

85
00:05:28,849 --> 00:05:33,139
proposed change that I might have

86
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:35,179
predicted but nonetheless a proposed

87
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:37,789
change and there's a slide after this

88
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:40,899
that will go into that and we have some

89
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:43,869
preliminary agreement among a few people

90
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:46,669
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thank them for their work on that</font>

91
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:49,999
but then we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see whether it's</font>

92
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:52,188
comfortable for others the<font color="#E5E5E5"> political</font>

93
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:54,110
considerations one current draft has

94
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:57,169
text there was discussion about that

95
00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:01,399
online I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we navigated that to a</font>

96
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:03,979
useful position and I'm touching these

97
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:06,559
just as a reminder<font color="#E5E5E5"> in case anybody wants</font>

98
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:08,389
to raise anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about them but I think</font>

99
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:10,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they are settled issues the numbers</font>

100
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:15,490
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sections that these</font>

101
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:17,889
concern on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> primary hotel there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

102
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,929
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> about whether the current</font>

103
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:24,050
model of targeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-third of the</font>

104
00:06:20,929 --> 00:06:27,498
expected attendance was the right choice

105
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:30,649
this is another balancing act a smaller

106
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:32,719
number lets us get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to more hotels but it</font>

107
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:37,399
fills up in microseconds instead of

108
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:39,199
milliseconds and a bigger number doesn't

109
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:42,740
fill up as quickly but locks us out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

110
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,419
hotels where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion landed seems</font>

111
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,500
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been that we stay with what we</font>

112
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:49,109
have

113
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,270
and I haven't seen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

114
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,190
controversial point on the list I

115
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,240
thought the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> was reasonable</font>

116
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,480
about it there's been a little more

117
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,130
discussion among people here this

118
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,340
weekend it still landed in the same

119
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:05,070
place so if anybody wants to propose

120
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,200
that that be different they probably

121
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:10,530
have an uphill<font color="#E5E5E5"> battle to convince others</font>

122
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's a change to make and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

123
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:16,369
include trying to explain the balancing

124
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:21,870
act being better in for that alternative

125
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:23,970
so I mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> why do we need I think</font>

126
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the only thing pending is a very</font>

127
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:28,890
small change that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was proposed this</font>

128
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:30,450
morning it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the end of the world if</font>

129
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:34,050
it's adopted<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's not the end of the</font>

130
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:36,450
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it isn't unfiltered access that</font>

131
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:38,610
was another one that was debated a fair

132
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:40,919
amount and where we landed is the text

133
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:45,330
that's in the draft now which i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is</font>

134
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:48,570
been fairly stable text for a while it

135
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:53,659
it's that's a particularly difficult one

136
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:56,130
because to do that precisely enough

137
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:59,610
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> means we couldn't go almost</font>

138
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:02,760
anywhere and and so the current language

139
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:06,600
is a more general than an engineer might

140
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:11,729
want but necessary for the facilities

141
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:14,010
and ops people accessibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is</font>

142
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:17,190
a tough one<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> current language</font>

143
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:19,409
which I think has no<font color="#E5E5E5"> operational benefit</font>

144
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,660
it sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> good it's reasonable it's</font>

145
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:23,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">clearly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right intent and there's no way</font>

146
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know whether you're satisfying it or</font>

147
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,590
not and and to make that even more

148
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:30,240
interesting i'll now raise the point

149
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,478
that comes up periodically on the list

150
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,690
and this is one of a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of topics</font>

151
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:39,330
and that is we can't just say oh a DA

152
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,880
done because we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an American</font>

153
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:45,600
organization or international and to the

154
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:48,380
extent that there are specifications

155
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,850
that we like and we want to have apply

156
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,680
for accessibility or any other topic

157
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:56,459
that apply to all of the venues around

158
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:59,550
the world that we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to if it is in fact</font>

159
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:00,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">tied to a particular nation we have a</font>

160
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenge</font>

161
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:06,240
enforceability I'll distinguish it's not

162
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:09,900
on this list<font color="#CCCCCC"> but there's a language now</font>

163
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,610
and it's from one particular place in

164
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">the current draft and has been moved and</font>

165
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:17,820
tweaked a bit more generally that we

166
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:21,990
conform to local laws and and if you

167
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about it it's like well duh would</font>

168
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,560
we go somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we wouldn't</font>

169
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,750
conform to local laws but the main point

170
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,239
behind that text being there in that

171
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:33,420
form is to remind us that we are subject

172
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">to local laws and that we can't really</font>

173
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,770
say oh you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to conform to the</font>

174
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:45,960
American laws or the Dutch laws or the

175
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:48,270
gym the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Swiss laws so I i I'm not sure</font>

176
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:53,130
what language we can put in that will

177
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:58,610
work but but all<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in there now says</font>

178
00:09:53,130 --> 00:10:02,400
that facilities shall be accessible and

179
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:05,130
as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> onlus discussion showed that it's</font>

180
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">not clear what we mean by that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

181
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,570
importantly for the folks finding venues

182
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,880
it's not clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you test whether it</font>

183
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,070
succeeded to the other piece to this

184
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,200
that to me is surprising and confusing

185
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:20,250
and problematic is it's labeled as

186
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,750
desired since<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and saying desired</font>

187
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,540
means it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to go to a place that</font>

188
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:28,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't accessible for some definition of</font>

189
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,699
accessible I think we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get better</font>

190
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,220
language and we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font>

191
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:43,340
mandatory but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure where to go</font>

192
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:45,300
with that suggestions Alyssa Cooper um I

193
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,850
imagine we're not the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization</font>

194
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:51,420
that has ever grappled with this so

195
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:56,880
perhaps we could look around or ask our

196
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:59,280
friends the w3c<font color="#CCCCCC"> e or Linux Foundation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

197
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,439
sunday<font color="#CCCCCC"> onlus discussion did have some</font>

198
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,470
references<font color="#CCCCCC"> to other documents and i</font>

199
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,660
think that the issue is somebody

200
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:10,050
advocating a particular choice and then

201
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:13,230
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> group agreeing to it yeah it's</font>

202
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,949
pretty soft your microphone what is on

203
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:17,310
its on you

204
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:18,720
it is on but it's very very soft us he

205
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:22,170
seems India maybe that's intentional

206
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,340
it's a good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys good okay this is</font>

207
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:28,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">not one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I had followed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the list</font>

208
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:30,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">so the berry liebe in some of the</font>

209
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">organizations I'm aware of there's a</font>

210
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:36,510
they don't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on community consensus</font>

211
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,140
driving the venue selection and the

212
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:41,100
venue selection people have their own

213
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,470
mechanisms and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have it</font>

214
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,630
written down so yes we're not the only

215
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,970
organization to need to do it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

216
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:53,520
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it written down we</font>

217
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:55,980
can look at the ones that do but let me

218
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,110
stress my feeling is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

219
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:01,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">have some text that gives useful</font>

220
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:03,360
guidance to the venue staff the venue

221
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">selecting staff so that when they go to</font>

222
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,680
look at a place<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have something that</font>

223
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">will let them evaluate reasonably</font>

224
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,819
objectively and reasonably easily

225
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,840
without locking us out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> too many</font>

226
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:19,680
places Lou burger speaking as a

227
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:24,390
co-author but in by no means an expert

228
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,589
in this field so to<font color="#CCCCCC"> alyssa comment i did</font>

229
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,150
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you said when we were putting</font>

230
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:30,090
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> draft together</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i went and</font>

231
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:31,949
searched and I came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found I what I</font>

232
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:34,140
thought was a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good reference and</font>

233
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:36,180
I put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the document that's as</font>

234
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:39,930
good as I could find as a non-expert

235
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,910
what we haven't done is gone and found

236
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:44,670
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> expert and you should have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay for</font>

237
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:48,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">them and said lets you know help us</font>

238
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:49,860
craft the language so something that we

239
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:52,610
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider is whether we as an</font>

240
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:55,680
organization want to go to that expense

241
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:58,290
with a finance chair pad on<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll say</font>

242
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,260
please no but will also do what the

243
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:06,089
community wants probably depends on how

244
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:09,420
much the person costs Alyssa Cooper um

245
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:11,580
thanks Lou that's helpful I think one

246
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,530
one place that we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just ask quite</font>

247
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:15,780
easily I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think she would have the</font>

248
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:19,020
answer herself but we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> motoko here</font>

249
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:21,480
last time to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of human</font>

250
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:24,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">rights issues generally and I know that</font>

251
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,710
they have worked with some you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in</font>

252
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">the frame of meeting planning</font>

253
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:31,150
I don't know if she has any resources

254
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:36,040
and about this specifically but it's not

255
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:38,079
hard to ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> Marcus sending her an email</font>

256
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,310
doesn't cost anything and so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy</font>

257
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,940
to do that if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it would be</font>

258
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:45,010
helpful it's okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I jumped the</font>

259
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,080
queue to respond I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's an</font>

260
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:49,000
issue of finding experts there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

261
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,460
of experts out there who helped

262
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,470
organizations with this and we can go to

263
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,360
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right export for and ask for the</font>

264
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,970
right problem I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is</font>

265
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,470
human rights thing the if its

266
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,740
accessibility we go to someone who's an

267
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:04,780
accessibility expert who works with

268
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,610
international organizations and does

269
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,720
that for the living we can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font>

270
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:12,880
question is whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to pay for</font>

271
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:15,760
that so my sense is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic is</font>

272
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,500
one that is pretty well understood as an

273
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,990
area of expertise with people who know a

274
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,030
lot and are can be quite practical about

275
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:24,250
it and that what will prove to be the

276
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,620
hard part for us is defining boundaries

277
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:34,060
to what we insist on versus not insist

278
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:36,910
on and Ursula Van so um I I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

279
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,979
this discussion is in some sense a

280
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,560
species of a more general problem that

281
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,700
I've raised more than once with this

282
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,890
document and since you raised it here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

283
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,780
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to press on it again and</font>

284
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:49,150
that is this distinction between

285
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:51,160
mandatory and desired<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus important</font>

286
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:56,709
and would be nice and the distinction

287
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:58,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">between uh requirements</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> versus</font>

288
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:02,140
considerations I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that entire</font>

289
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:05,290
matrix is completely hopelessly confused

290
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:07,689
and and I don't understand how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

291
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:09,250
going to provide guidance to the IOC

292
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,900
when it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make these decisions</font>

293
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:14,740
because I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to decide</font>

294
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:18,189
whether something on whether a for

295
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:20,320
instance desired requirement is to be

296
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:22,840
traded<font color="#E5E5E5"> off against an important</font>

297
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,760
consideration or not and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

298
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,140
know how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this work so in fact</font>

299
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,090
that's either the next slide or the

300
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,920
slide after it so thank you okay no no

301
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:32,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">way Jenny this thing was up here ya know</font>

302
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,319
it's certainly an issue for this and

303
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,970
several others ok Mary born so that so

304
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,700
the document<font color="#CCCCCC"> that livery forward to</font>

305
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,449
right why is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can't use that</font>

306
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">as our</font>

307
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:44,799
for instant guidelines someone else hash

308
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,919
through it right that organization right

309
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,779
um and I would think that we could use

310
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:50,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guidelines go to whoever you're</font>

311
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:52,899
trying to negotiate with and at least

312
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:54,009
understand the limitations and let

313
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:55,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">people know ahead of time what the</font>

314
00:15:54,009 --> 00:16:00,119
limitations are we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to get</font>

315
00:15:55,569 --> 00:16:03,219
perfection in any of this right but<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:04,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a dog analytic day I with the</font>

00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:13,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">it just it's cold um the issue is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

320
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:15,699
that we don't have change control of

321
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:18,429
that document so if they make some

322
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:20,199
change that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree with what</font>

323
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:22,029
does that mean what does that mean to

324
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:26,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> community so if we make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it mandatory</font>

325
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:29,589
to follow someone else's document um the

326
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:32,498
we may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right for the community</font>

335
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:58,929
those political considerations and now

336
00:16:56,859 --> 00:17:01,329
I'm going to say this we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

337
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:03,039
careful what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we put in guys because in</font>

338
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:05,079
my organizations I have people<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

Iranian descent who refused<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to us</font>

00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:10,869
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how they were treated</font>

at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> border sorry just a second year</font>

342
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:15,879
just to make sure I'm clear you're going

343
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:17,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the pro today yeah I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

344
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,069
lag because I'm because it's a slippery

345
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:24,510
slope instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that we should we</font>

346
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:28,240
should we can put<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in our document</font>

347
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:30,850
that represent what we say we want to

348
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,159
come here and be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say without any</font>

349
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:36,000
limitations on any topic thats related

350
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:38,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">to our work that also includes privacy</font>

351
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,289
censorship things like that we should be

352
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to come here and have a free</font>

353
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:45,700
internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to anywhere we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

354
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:49,020
have it accessed those who thinks we

355
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:51,450
should be putting in and not try to

356
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:55,680
they and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things when put in will</font>

357
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:57,360
make a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy selection of venue to</font>

358
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:01,740
some countries yes to some countries

359
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:05,669
know so the mailing list had<font color="#CCCCCC"> said and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

360
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:08,180
live in singapore by the way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i now</font>

361
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:13,020
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i witnessed the discussion that</font>

362
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:17,280
again educate people about the issues

363
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:20,610
and real threats of certain countries on

364
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,160
or perceived threats so so the working

365
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:26,840
group mailing list had a discussion in

366
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:30,660
this realm<font color="#CCCCCC"> and landed on some language</font>

367
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:33,570
if if anyone thinks the language is not

368
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:36,330
acceptable they should raise that again

369
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:41,939
on the mailing list the second piece to

370
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:46,970
this the operational piece is that one

371
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:49,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the purposes behind vetting cities or</font>

372
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:53,010
through the the early announcement of

373
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:55,139
cities that are not being looked at

374
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,570
immediately for choice but rather for

375
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:00,180
being possible for choice at some

376
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:03,120
unknown point in the future one of the

377
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:06,030
reasons to do that is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> avoid our</font>

378
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">having to specify criteria and leave</font>

379
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:11,040
that choice up to the community so it it

380
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,820
the range of things that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

381
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:17,520
about if the community says for this

382
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:19,830
fort for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the concerns of the ietf</font>

383
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:23,000
community this venue is not satisfactory

384
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:26,250
in those regards then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't go there</font>

385
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,230
hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jason living good quick comment about</font>

386
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,360
accessibility I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you mean</font>

387
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,370
is wheelchair accessible and if that's

388
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case why not just say wheelchair</font>

389
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:38,280
accessible and be done with it I think

390
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:40,080
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we tend to in the ITF act</font>

391
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,670
in a way that's sort of like waterfall

392
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,980
software development this documents got

393
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:47,040
to be perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we can't ship it until</font>

394
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:49,200
it's done I would suggest keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

395
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,399
get something in there and updated over

396
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,800
time you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know once</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a year or something</font>

397
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this as we learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from how this</font>

398
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,310
stuff is applied and I would say in

399
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,600
terms of external references if we're

400
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,000
concerned that some group might update

401
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,689
it if they do update a first question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

402
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,250
have they ever updated if this is

403
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,860
just a theoretical question we love

404
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,570
rattling on theoretical questions but if

405
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,279
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually update it in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> future</font>

406
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,168
then update the document or something or

407
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,419
pull in all their requirements incite

408
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:15,820
them by in some other way but I think

409
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:19,389
keep it simple we can complexity r and

410
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:22,870
it gets a bit ridiculous so for for

411
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:25,360
reference I my<font color="#E5E5E5"> own thinking landed</font>

412
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:28,178
similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> where years has in terms of</font>

413
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,610
the pure pragmatics and I floated that

414
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:34,240
on the list and nobody responded or that

415
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:36,039
if they did it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> positive ok</font>

416
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,690
Mary Barnes<font color="#CCCCCC"> back again so on the</font>

417
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:39,610
following back up on the latest thing

418
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,789
about the document changing relating to

419
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:44,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jason's point to me that document is way</font>

420
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:46,500
better<font color="#CCCCCC"> than nothing at all and just</font>

421
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:49,929
saying wheelchair accessibility right is

422
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:51,220
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there is more there so I can</font>

423
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:52,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand that document may change</font>

424
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,000
right but to me it's a good starting

425
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:56,409
point and again we're not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

426
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,330
perfection right it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

427
00:20:56,409 --> 00:21:00,429
recommendations but let's at least know

428
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:02,168
going in these are the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

429
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:03,759
desirable and let's make sure we

430
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:07,590
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that facility can</font>

431
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,590

jason said I mean looking at these

439
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:34,509
accessibility documents they have long

440
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:36,250
lists of criteria some of which seem

441
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:37,690
more relevant to us than others mean for

442
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,539
example they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all sorts of stuff</font>

443
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,889
about accessibility purple I'm people we

444
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:43,779
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one we have at least one regular</font>

445
00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:45,719
attendee why'd you know on the other

446
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:48,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">hand this they have a criteria like</font>

447
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,950
elevators must have blindly must have

448
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,450
Braille labels<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and I'm thinking we</font>

449
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,279
go to Taiwan and it happens the

450
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:58,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">Taiwanese Braille is completely</font>

451
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:59,769
unrelated to to American Braille so my

452
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:03,190
suggestion would be that the wording

453
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:05,289
would it might be useful to say here's a

454
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:09,009
bunch of accessibility guidelines to

455
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:11,470
look at and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aoc should consider</font>

456
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:14,619
the accessibility of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proposed venue</font>

457
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,430
in the country basically considering we

458
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:17,139
expect to attend

459
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:19,060
it probably means that wheelchair

460
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,920
accessibility at with the people who

461
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:23,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">come now is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issue that's the most</font>

462
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,940
important but you know as we get older

463
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,080
and people have different issues that

464
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,330
might change and I figured would rather

465
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,199
have the documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> say just make sure it</font>

466
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:33,340
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the people who are going to</font>

467
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:37,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">come so let me let me test something and</font>

468
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:41,679
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have two bullets to two</font>

469
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:44,620
requirements one is that along<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lines</font>

470
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:48,250
of the the meeting facility<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

471
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:53,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">hotel shall have good wheelchair access</font>

472
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:57,760
to common resources and rooms and that's

473
00:22:53,830 --> 00:23:01,810
mandatory and then a additional

474
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:04,600
accessibility is to be desired and cite

475
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:07,659
the document that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lou has in mind and</font>

476
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,520
I'm not that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decisions at</font>

477
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,290
ITF meetings and so I'm just going to

478
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask whether people think that's a</font>

479
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:15,149
reasonable approach for resolving this

480
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:25,929
go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mike lee berger is actually</font>

481
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,550
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to basically say it you said</font>

482
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:30,310
it better<font color="#CCCCCC"> i fully support that that</font>

483
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:33,040
position i think it's it's very workable

484
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:35,350
from the the concerns related to

485
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,610
referencing an external document and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

486
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,649
think it's as good as we can get with

487
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:42,189
with without bringing such a document

488
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:43,450
into our domain and we could do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font>

489
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,940
we should recognize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's time</font>

490
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">and expense and all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our time involved</font>

491
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,890
in that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's as good as we</font>

492
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:52,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">can get so I really support that unless</font>

493
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,130
we're going to be a real clear this

494
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,110
document here early hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andrew dog</font>

495
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,240
unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to be reopening this</font>

496
00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:01,629
document early why not just say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

497
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,520
know every now and then we go to meeting

498
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,010
selections we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to poke</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

499
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,410
community based on the criteria in that

500
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:10,660
document to actually realize because

501
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:12,160
today there may be a wheelchair tomorrow

502
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:15,100
maybe something else we're not going to

503
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,470
put in today so<font color="#E5E5E5"> poke community in</font>

504
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:20,740
advance with criteria<font color="#CCCCCC"> which are</font>

505
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:22,930
important and then we will know yeah and

506
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:25,780
then and then this when we select venues

507
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:29,380
we can take a you know relatively

508
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:31,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">up-to-date a result of</font>

509
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:35,070
survey<font color="#E5E5E5"> said to the list people may say</font>

510
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:37,450
those are important please select those

511
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:40,389
otherwise we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to put criteria</font>

512
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:42,460
that either will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be valid or will stop</font>

513
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:45,070
being valid or<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be out of date or</font>

514
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:50,410
will well be spinning<font color="#E5E5E5"> this back and</font>

515
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:53,830
forth any other discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> or comments</font>

516
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:57,340
on the slide items on the slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

517
00:24:53,830 --> 00:25:01,300
slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

518
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:03,909
where the discussions on food<font color="#CCCCCC"> texts have</font>

519
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,879
landed the first two bullets are in the

520
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:09,670
current draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe this is correct</font>

521
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:13,450
this is 0 this will go back a slide I

522
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:16,180
put it there I did put it here no I

523
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:22,960
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so search for food it's</font>

524
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:26,230
in the draft on food sorry and<font color="#CCCCCC"> um where</font>

525
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:29,440
the discussions landed<font color="#CCCCCC"> seems to be</font>

526
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:33,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">satisfied with the third bullet I will</font>

527
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:36,010
mention that one<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading of the the</font>

528
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,900
proposed change produced a comment but

529
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:40,600
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is redundant with the first two</font>

530
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:42,310
bullets and that led to pointing out

531
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,530
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the purpose of the third bullet is</font>

532
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:47,530
to integrate the first two bullets in a

533
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:50,020
particular way<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the first to billets</font>

534
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:51,840
end up serving as a foundation notice

535
00:25:50,020 --> 00:26:02,080
the second bullet is not mandatory

536
00:25:51,840 --> 00:26:04,449
whereas for the third it is so anybody

537
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:13,360
finding themselves having a reaction

538
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:17,800
that requires discussion um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

539
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:23,260
do the hum thing folks who think this

540
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:31,149
will be workable and sufficient to the

541
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:36,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">purpose hum folks who think we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

542
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:43,900
work on this thank you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

543
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:46,720
and I should I<font color="#CCCCCC"> should call out Laura on</font>

544
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:49,810
the staff side and Mariana on the food

545
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,340
side for for their considerable

546
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:53,860
contributions over the course of this

547
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:59,139
weekend last weekend trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find this</font>

548
00:26:53,860 --> 00:27:00,850
balance yay<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay other issues so this is</font>

549
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:04,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first bullet is the one that Andrew</font>

550
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:06,969
raised they could easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> take all the</font>

551
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,620
remaining time unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's also</font>

552
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:11,500
the foundation the other bullets aren't

553
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:14,020
useful until we figure this out the

554
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,450
current document has a model that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

555
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:18,430
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand very well i am</font>

556
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:23,680
from what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can tell neither do a lot of</font>

557
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:25,990
other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know it was motivated by</font>

558
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:30,010
a conceptual framework it's just I<font color="#CCCCCC"> never</font>

559
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:33,460
fully understood it and there are four

560
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:37,270
labels and so that's the first sub

561
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:38,620
bullet and in trying to figure out and

562
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:42,940
there's been some discussion on the list

563
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:45,760
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the discussion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has tended</font>

564
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:47,320
to divide between keeping the four

565
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,540
labels and figuring them out better

566
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,929
versus going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to two labels of mandatory</font>

567
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:57,790
and optional where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> personally landed</font>

568
00:27:52,930 --> 00:28:01,120
is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> between and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explanation i'll</font>

569
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:04,480
give for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there's stuff that we</font>

570
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,520
must satisfy and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't satisfy it</font>

571
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,190
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't go there period full stop</font>

572
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,290
really simple there is stuff that we'd

573
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:15,010
like but it none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it is a showstopper</font>

574
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:17,470
and that's I'll say nice because no one

575
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:19,300
will over interpret that and then there

576
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:21,610
are some stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are willing to</font>

577
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:23,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">trade off on and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trade off stuff</font>

578
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:25,719
might be difficult and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

579
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:28,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">careful about the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of trading off</font>

580
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,730
and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more discussion but that's a</font>

581
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:33,790
set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we want enough to</font>

582
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:36,870
press for but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily enough to</font>

583
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:40,480
treat any one of them as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> show stopper</font>

584
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:43,649
and that's so I landed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my personally</font>

585
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:48,220
as wanting the three<font color="#E5E5E5"> categories</font>

586
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:50,470
discussion hi I'm Bob in didn't ya so I

587
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:53,289
finished<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading this and</font>

588
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:55,210
my reaction was<font color="#E5E5E5"> for was too many because</font>

589
00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:57,730
I mean I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been on I'm on the meeting</font>

590
00:28:55,210 --> 00:29:01,240
committee and but didn't on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IOC and</font>

591
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:03,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">I like it's important it seems to me</font>

592
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,280
important is more important than desired

593
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:08,889
and so I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> this very ambiguous</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

594
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:12,549
think three would be better and not

595
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:14,880
exactly sure what the words are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the and</font>

596
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:19,120
then they also later in the document in

597
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:21,460
3.2 it also uses word an optimum an

598
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,889
optimal facility that that shouldn't be

599
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:27,549
here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should use these word to not add</font>

600
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:30,610
other adjectives that ad on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

601
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:37,210
optimal and desired go together in the

602
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:40,030
same paragraph good point blending um my

603
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:42,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">overall comet is that I think we spend</font>

604
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:44,408
too much time on the word in the meaning

605
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,500
of it this document is guidance to the

606
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:49,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">IOC it's not a piece of code that's</font>

607
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,570
going to execute with instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> else's and</font>

608
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:54,760
if it doesn't execute properly code

609
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:56,710
crashes we have intelligent people on

610
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,658
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOC we put them there we selected</font>

611
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,370
the through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gong com let them do</font>

612
00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:03,370
their job and give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guidance</font>

613
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:04,629
they need with some words but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

614
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,739
intelligent people they can interpret

615
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:11,110
the words and go<font color="#CCCCCC"> do their job so so</font>

616
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't sit down yet I i have a feeling</font>

617
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:16,240
what I'm about to say is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just my</font>

618
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:19,330
view that got us Singapore that got us

619
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,940
this working group in other words we've

620
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:23,860
demonstrated that while it's an entirely

621
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,960
reasonable model it isn't sufficient to

622
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">the community I'm so since i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

623
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,299
seeing down i can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this i don't agree</font>

624
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:35,320
that that goddess singapore or<font color="#E5E5E5"> this mean</font>

625
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:38,500
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think what drove this meeting was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

626
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,990
there wasn't formal guidance that was

627
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:44,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">captured and provided to the IOC and</font>

628
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:48,240
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that for more guidance but</font>

629
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:50,320
its guidance not code and it's not

630
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">regulatory language that we would have</font>

631
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:57,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">at other spaces is guidance from the</font>

632
00:30:52,750 --> 00:31:00,399
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that group for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's worth I</font>

633
00:30:57,809 --> 00:31:02,289
got Singapore because within educate

634
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,439
people and they made their own

635
00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:05,870
calculon's

636
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,759
hey with yeah we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> Singapore will be</font>

637
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:09,258
really sweet and rude<font color="#E5E5E5"> Organa because we</font>

638
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:11,000
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> educate people and we get drunk</font>

639
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:13,549
arguments because of that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree with</font>

640
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">your three statements I think if we want</font>

641
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:18,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a trade of the category which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

642
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:20,509
I think important it probably would

643
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,809
probably should a you know minimum

644
00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:25,429
percentage of trade of things that we do

645
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:28,100
want to satisfy so let's say if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

646
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:30,350
10 of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those trade of Saturday categories</font>

647
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,240
you know you at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least need to meet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

648
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:34,370
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever the number is you guys</font>

649
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,299
discuss it otherwise the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade of really</font>

650
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:40,699
becomes nice so it should have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

651
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:46,450
it's important for that but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

652
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:46,450
needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extra weight ah</font>

653
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:56,419
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is andrew sullivan um so I</font>

654
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:58,129
understand why you suggested that

655
00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:00,169
deciding on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of these things</font>

656
00:31:58,129 --> 00:32:02,240
is necessary to continue the rest of

657
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:05,059
this but i would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to frame this is</font>

658
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,190
potentially another way to do it so

659
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:09,710
Alyssa and I put together<font color="#CCCCCC"> a draft a</font>

660
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:13,190
little while ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alternative</font>

661
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:15,259
to the ancestor of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current draft and</font>

662
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:18,429
the reason for that was because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

663
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:21,620
believe that this matrix approach or

664
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:23,779
mandatory trade-off nice or however you

665
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:27,320
like to do this is never going to work

666
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:29,299
um and the reason at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was my</font>

667
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,759
motivation I won't one speak for Lissa

668
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:34,340
the reason that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is that</font>

669
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:37,940
fundamentally<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh what you're always</font>

670
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:41,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing for any venue is deciding among a</font>

671
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:43,429
whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trades and what we were</font>

672
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:45,200
suggesting was that we needed instead a

673
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:46,970
rank ordering of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

674
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,789
were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trade the ones that were</font>

675
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:52,279
the important stuff and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

676
00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:54,049
else and that was just a random list of

677
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:56,240
stuff and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were going to have</font>

678
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:58,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to depend on judgment now I appreciate</font>

679
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,490
Dave that your view is that this is

680
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:04,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopelessly naive my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> view is that then I</font>

681
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:08,840
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sophisticated I may be a hobo</font>

682
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:11,619
village uh my<font color="#CCCCCC"> view is that is that the</font>

683
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,570
categories here are sufficiently bad

684
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:17,209
that what will happen is we will end up

685
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:20,120
in in on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two</font>

686
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:23,059
battles 1 when producing this document

687
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:27,080
the community will rat hole on on the

688
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:30,230
categories and then secondly I every

689
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:32,120
future decision which<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh you know cuts</font>

690
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:33,740
across these things people a<font color="#E5E5E5"> rat hole on</font>

691
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,658
you know whether the categories were

692
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,669
applied correctly which of course is

693
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:42,230
your objection to the rank ordering

694
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:44,570
instead on so so my view is that you

695
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:46,340
can't actually decide on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this number or</font>

696
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:48,860
decide what the categories are or in

697
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:50,720
fact online the differences carefully

698
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,820
enough to get this right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's the</font>

699
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:58,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I don't actually like that</font>

700
00:33:52,820 --> 00:34:00,379
that approach that Jason looking good I

701
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:02,360
agree with Andrew that it's it's hard

702
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:04,190
when selecting a venue you're always

703
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,590
looking at lots of different trade-offs

704
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:09,770
and it's a complicated decision as Glenn

705
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:11,149
said you can't program it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we're</font>

706
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:13,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">not careful we'll end up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with you know</font>

707
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:15,168
one or two venues that perfectly meet

708
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:18,439
the requirements and that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

709
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:21,489
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll go around the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world so and I</font>

710
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:25,190
think preserving some ability for the

711
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:27,649
folks working on selection to have or to

712
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:29,270
exercise judgment based on lots of

713
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:31,129
different criteria and make that you

714
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:34,399

involved in this discussion and have<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

719
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:49,190
am deeply appreciative that they have

720
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:52,009
pushed quite hard when something seemed

721
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:54,619
impractical they've been encouraged and

722
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:56,899
have I suspect even if they hadn't been

723
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:59,089
encouraged have been very diligent about

00:34:56,899 --> 00:35:01,730
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure we hear when something</font>

725
00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:04,820
sounds impractical so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> worst case</font>

00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:06,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">scenario that you're describing I think</font>

727
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:10,910
we have a safety<font color="#E5E5E5"> check against that</font>

728
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:13,099
during this development process this is

729
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:15,890
barrett liebe a couple of comments that

730
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:18,440
built up as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was in the queue foot with</font>

in response to<font color="#E5E5E5"> glen i completely agree</font>

735
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:31,100
say that the wording of our choices

736
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:34,040
needs to be clearer

737
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:36,710
to the committee so yes it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter</font>

738
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:40,130
how we describe the different trade-offs

739
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:44,150
where we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about I I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> disagree</font>

think<font color="#E5E5E5"> dave has separated it out very</font>

742
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:54,290
nicely there's a set of things that if

743
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:57,170
any one of them fails we will not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

746
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:07,480

749
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:16,640
we might ordinarily consider to be more

important trades off against everything

751
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,940
else being absolutely perfect and i

752
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:25,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the by putting this as just a set</font>

753
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:27,530
of things that can be traded off and

754
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:29,300
leaving it to the intelligence<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

755
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:31,940
meeting committee is the right thing it

756
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,190
gives them guidance without locking them

757
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:41,510
into a particular model and lets them

758

have the flexibility they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> leslie</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's a pretty important to</font>

understand what it is that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

763
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:56,210
to do I mean I certainly resonate with

764
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:58,040
Glenn's comments that this we're not

765
00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:00,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">building an algorithm at least not one</font>

766
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:03,710
that you we're not we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

767
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:06,380
run code I think you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be optimistic to</font>

768
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:07,700
think we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> find even one meeting</font>

769
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:11,630
venue that would perfectly need all of

770
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:13,189
our requirements so given that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

771
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,660
what we're actually trying to do is

772
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:17,690
understand what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the community</font>

773
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:19,460
expects so that we can best deliver on

774
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:22,100
community expectations at any given

775
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:23,420
point in time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we actually</font>

776
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:27,220
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a little bit of running</font>

777
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:31,280
code about what to do when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

778
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:33,109
venue that is it works for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

779
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,060
criteria but we know there are perceived

780
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:39,310
issues on another front and I'm

781
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:43,690
referring specifically to IETF 101

782
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:46,270
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> London in it you know we've announced</font>

783
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:52,480
this week that we're going to London yes

784
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:54,340
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Metro hole for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a while and and but</font>

785
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,840
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've also pointed out you know we</font>

786
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,160
we know what some of the issues were and

787
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,080
here are how we're trying to mitigate

788
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,029
them with the differentiated room box

789
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,710
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can identify whether want the</font>

790
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:05,740
cheaper rate or a better room<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

791
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:07,480
so all that just sort of to suggest you

792
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:09,520
know maybe there's some running code for

793
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:12,130
as we all go through this learning

794
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,950
process of how do we understand what the

795
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:18,370
requirements are how can we you know

796
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:20,919
live in in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> imperfect world you know</font>

797
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:24,160
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we maybe we don't actually have to</font>

798
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,900
try to make this an algorithm and since

799
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,790
since I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> up here i'll i will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

800
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:31,060
observe I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's for this</font>

801
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:33,340
document or even necessarily for this

802
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:36,940
working group but we do also have an

803
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:38,350
issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what do we do with conditions</font>

804
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:41,200
that change in between the time when we

805
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:42,490
negotiate contracts and you know three

806
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,620
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> later when we get somewhere and</font>

807
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:46,660
this is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know far from being a</font>

808
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:51,210
hypothetical situation we've got it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

809
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:54,940
any number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our upcoming venues um so</font>

810
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:58,270
this young man is high in that can on

811
00:38:54,940 --> 00:39:01,240
that last point of changing conditions

812
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:03,220
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this specially because we not have on</font>

813
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,919
ourselves but in the world they are

814
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,149
changing conditions all the time

815
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:11,260
countries that<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed stable all of a</font>

816
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:13,390
sudden or not and things change we were

817
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:17,410
originally<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wanted to put some</font>

818
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:19,480
language in the text basically looking

819
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:21,640
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so what do you what are a</font>

820
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:24,370
criteria where you start to kind of like

821
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,470
think about triggering a change that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

822
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:28,210
an venue is<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not anymore so</font>

823
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:30,790
acceptable and what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do about that</font>

824
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:35,170
and there was in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last meeting there</font>

825
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:37,090
was discussion also about what if we

826
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:40,510
have to cancel a meeting completely undo

827
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:45,700
it virtually and so on I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font>

828
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:47,740
the handover from Fred to Dave we have a

829
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,359
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit forgotten about that and we</font>

830
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:51,669
most probably have to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to that</font>

831
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,430
and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how we solve those issues and</font>

832
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:55,930
how we can

833
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:58,520
guidance on when what are kind of like

834
00:39:55,930 --> 00:40:01,790
people dole moments in history which

835
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:06,680
make us change might change venue or

836
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:08,300
even cancel a meeting for for reference

837
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,609
on that topic it doesn't it doesn't

838
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:13,490
answer the point that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> own is raising</font>

839
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:15,260
but the document where it has a

840
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:18,759
discussion of the the sequence the

841
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:20,980
actual operation of the venue there is a

842
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,910
final check about<font color="#E5E5E5"> three months out</font>

843
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:26,210
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably going to be a</font>

844
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:28,609
significant point for resolving this um

845
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:32,420
so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow the point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> misleading</font>

846
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:34,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">go again um I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's important</font>

847
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,920
actually to not try to make this

848
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:38,890
document deal with that problem as well

849
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">just from the standpoint of modularity</font>

850
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:42,940
it may be that this working group wants

851
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:45,170
to tackle that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I would advise</font>

852
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:49,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">attacking it any separate document</font>

853
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:50,360
because the issues do get complex you

854
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:54,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">know once there are contracts in place</font>

855
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:55,790
and it's a whole different kettle of

856
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:57,980
fish once you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have contracts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in place</font>

857
00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:00,200
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have tickets purchased right</font>

858
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,480
i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually did have to look at</font>

859
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,919
buenos aires and decide whether Zeke was

860
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,710
going to be enough of a threat there at

861
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,850
a point when people had already<font color="#E5E5E5"> paid</font>

862
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:10,220
tickets that they would not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been</font>

863
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:16,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to redeem so it's a big problem</font>

864
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:18,319
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it somewhere else Alyssa Cooper so</font>

865
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:21,650
Barry<font color="#E5E5E5"> you said you said something about</font>

866
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:26,120
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> a meeting venue decision which is</font>

867
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:28,010
right and I actually think that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

868
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">not really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about like right decisions</font>

869
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,890
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong decisions because I don't</font>

870
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:33,980
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could really characterize any</font>

871
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:37,819
selection as as right or wrong I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

872
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:42,050
the value of this exercise is in making

873
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:44,120
the decisions justifiable so to me that

874
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:46,940
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the point of writing all</font>

875
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:51,080
of this down is such that in the future

876
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:53,660
when the IOC makes a selection which is

877
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,400
potentially controversial and the

878
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,129
community questions it there's a

879
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:00,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">reference point that the IOC can go back</font>

880
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:02,120
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say well look this is the</font>

881
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,730
criteria that we now have enshrined at

882
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,830
NRF see

883
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:09,280
and this is how we can justify that

884
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:11,200
decision after the fact and so every

885
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:15,100
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read the document that's what I</font>

886
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:17,169
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and the way that it's</font>

887
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:20,650
written right now I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it doesn't</font>

888
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:22,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">really provide that because there's it's</font>

889
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:25,390
you know it's a bucket of of

890
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,500
considerations and and many many things

891
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:29,770
that can be traded off against each

892
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:31,450
other and it will always<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good</font>

893
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:34,240
deal of that ambiguity I don't think we

894
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:36,368
can really get<font color="#E5E5E5"> around it but I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

895
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">could have a lot less</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it has now</font>

896
00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:40,390
and as it stands now I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it</font>

897
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,340
serves that purpose of being able being

898
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:44,140
usable to justify a controversial

899
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:47,080
decision so that's part of the reason

900
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:49,299
why I worked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andrew on on the rank</font>

901
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,830
ordering frankly like if the rank

902
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,290
ordering isn't the only way to achieve

903
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:55,330
that quality of justifiability there's

904
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:58,529
there's other ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think but it was</font>

905
00:42:55,330 --> 00:43:03,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a just one way that we thought of</font>

906
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:05,260
so it you know it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> that using</font>

907
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:07,750
the categories you could still achieve

908
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:09,010
that but especially if you look at a

909
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,920
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that are labeled</font>

910
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:14,830
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are currently labeled whatever</font>

911
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,750
important or desired but that may land

912
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:18,880
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this trade-off category I think they</font>

913
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:20,590
are they're completely not functional as

914
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,960
criteria and those are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

915
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:24,400
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the economic health and</font>

916
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,810
safety risks being acceptable to the

917
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,510
community and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the travel barriers to</font>

918
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:30,970
entry being acceptable to the community

919
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:33,460
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just that it's</font>

920
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:36,160
meaningless like it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that</font>

921
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:38,080
those are considerations saying that

922
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,390
their desired and making the bar

923
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,910
acceptable to the community doesn't

924
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:44,500
provide that mechanism that the IOC

925
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:46,359
needs to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to justify them after</font>

926
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:49,030
the fact because they don't offer any

927
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:50,230
actual guidance so that's that's the

928
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:51,280
direction<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think this needs to go</font>

929
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:53,020
and if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like the rank</font>

930
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,750
ordering there's you know we can talk

931
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:57,609
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> another way but as it stands I</font>

932
00:43:55,750 --> 00:44:01,030
don't think it actually is serving the

933
00:43:57,609 --> 00:44:04,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">purpose so I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to suggest closing</font>

934
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:07,150
the line for for whatever got people up

935
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:09,430
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the line right now after this and and</font>

936
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:12,880
then try to move into seeing whether we

937
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:16,000
can make some decisions this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Barry</font>

938
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,380
and alyssa i hope i'm pretty sure you

939
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't mean what you</font>

940
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:25,990
as strongly as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard it but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I if if I</font>

941
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:28,060
thought this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> all about being able to</font>

942
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:30,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">justify things after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that</font>

943
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:34,870
basically covering ourselves I would

944
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:36,820
despair I'm I'm aiming this at actually

945
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:38,529
giving useful advice to the meetings

946
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:41,050
committee and I think that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

947
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:44,650
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus it if a side effect of</font>

948
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:47,410
that is they can say yeah we did what

949
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:50,650
you told us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do okay fine but that to</font>

950
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:51,940
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not the focus of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this Alyssa I was</font>

951
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:54,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually serious about trying to close</font>

952
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:56,710
the line and because Egypt this stuff

953
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:59,470
can be discussed for very long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and</font>

954
00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:00,940
it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be but we don't have an</font>

955
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:02,850
infinite amount and I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to try to</font>

956
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:06,130
move us towards making some choices to

957
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:09,310
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on room I EOC but I USC head</font>

958
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:13,090
off um so I heard a couple of people say

959
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:16,060
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a program code if if you</font>

960
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:17,980
stayed something as mandatory if I'm a

961
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:22,420
community member actually I see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

962
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:24,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">a binary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> choice yes or no and in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font>

963
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:27,910
that essence actually it is a program

964
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:30,130
code so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want this to be a</font>

965
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:32,049
program code then I think you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

966
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:35,590
extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful with the red mandatory</font>

967
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:37,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">because if I'm on my meetings committee</font>

968
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:40,290
or if I'm in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community I will expect</font>

969
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:42,520
mandatory to be fulfilled<font color="#CCCCCC"> otherwise</font>

970
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:45,130
probably people will scream and

971
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:48,030
rightfully so so the use of mandatory

972
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:50,890
should be extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> carefully and</font>

973
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:52,720
probably strongly discouraged because

974
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:57,400
there is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of choices that might not</font>

975
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:59,259
be possible Mary barn so I liked a lot

976
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,600
of what Alyssa said and I don't know

977
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:04,540
that she meant the word justify so much

978
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,910
as make the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community aware of the</font>

979
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:08,470
trade-offs<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the committee had to</font>

980
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:09,790
make right which I think that's the

981
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:10,810
important thing the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to</font>

982
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:12,880
know when we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go somewhere</font>

983
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:14,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we're going to run into like we</font>

984
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,360
know we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> London and it's</font>

985
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,399
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a Habitrail maze but we know</font>

986
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,720
Stephanie and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other secretary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

987
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,400
will help entertain us while we're going

988
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,779
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the maze so that'll be cool it's</font>

989
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:26,140
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome if you weren't there um</font>

990
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:28,390
so anyways I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeping things</font>

991
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,890
simpler i think is better in my first

992
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:31,319
introduction to this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hadn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font>

993
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:33,960
the detailed meeting venue

994
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:36,480
I read the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Andrew and alyssa's and I</font>

995
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,640
like that and was very confused by the

996
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,110
meeting venue document initially so and

997
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,089
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the food thing is a good example</font>

998
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:44,040
right when I go there<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to know</font>

999
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:46,200
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not there's a grocery store</font>

1000
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,170
or the secretary the organizers have

1001
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:53,120
made sure that the staff are aware of

1002
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:53,120
people like me<font color="#CCCCCC"> right and I can get food</font>

1003
00:46:55,250 --> 00:47:00,420
hello this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is real silver I would first</font>

1004
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:01,860
like to say that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1005
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:04,440
great that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still having this</font>

1006
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:06,210
discussion and that it's also moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1007
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:10,050
a point where where it's getting more

1008
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:12,450
concrete I would really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to echo</font>

1009
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:16,290
what Alyssa said and also the previous

1010
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:18,540
speaker because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we cannot hard</font>

1011
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:20,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">code what we're going to do and having</font>

1012
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:22,680
some experience with Winston's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Human</font>

1013
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:26,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rights impact assessments of of</font>

1014
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:28,529
companies is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we cannot say what</font>

1015
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:31,170
we're going to encounter but it's very

1016
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:33,120
crucial that we say let me take all

1017
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:36,180
these things into<font color="#E5E5E5"> account and we</font>

1018
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:38,970
document how we came to these choices

1019
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:40,740
because we cannot say beforehand what is

1020
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:42,870
important what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to be important</font>

1021
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:45,060
but document that we're taking these in

1022
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:47,880
things into account and then having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1023
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:49,770
discussion into AC and making I<font color="#CCCCCC"> aoc and</font>

1024
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,720
making the justifiable so the community

1025
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:54,720
can have a discussion about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as well i</font>

1026
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:56,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">think is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most essential part of what</font>

1027
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:00,419
we should be doing here so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

1028
00:47:56,010 --> 00:48:04,850
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going forward well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1029
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:08,880
what I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make some attempt at is</font>

1030
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:10,980
resolving some of the items up there and

1031
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,720
there's different ways of doing that but

1032
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:17,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to choose one and we'll see</font>

1033
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:21,950
how it goes the first bullet provides an

1034
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:25,109
alternative of three sets of labels if

1035
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:27,299
anyone wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to propose an additional</font>

1036
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:32,190
set they should do that sooner rather

1037
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:35,370
than later<font color="#CCCCCC"> blouberg are you open to such</font>

1038
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:40,310
a proposal right now yes why<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't we</font>

1039
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:40,310
use our normal language should must may

1040
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:49,540
we have a process sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I have to tell</font>

1041
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:53,830
you I<font color="#CCCCCC"> really appreciate the room</font>

1042
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:56,259
reaction as clarifying a possible

1043
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:59,710
rejection of that suggestion but let me

1044
00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:02,020
let me check<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right hey there's an</font>

1045
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:05,680
intuitive appeal to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggestion but</font>

1046
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:10,380
the room reaction said maybe not anyone

1047
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,379
else want to advocate the the the choice

1048
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:18,390
well this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Barry I'll just say that</font>

1049
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:18,390
that those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> designed for code and</font>

1050
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,010
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't have the</font>

1051
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:25,868
flexibility we'd like for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I think</font>

1052
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:28,890
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all three levels so we have</font>

1053
00:49:25,869 --> 00:49:32,290
another we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking three levels and</font>

1054
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:34,540
while we've grappled with it we have

1055
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:36,730
applied those two requirements documents

1056
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:40,029
before and we've done it a number of

1057
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:41,800
times we have running code it's our

1058
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:47,140
process let's follow our process rather

1059
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:49,810
than invent a new one Jim Martin one

1060
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:52,060
point to keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind is that there it's</font>

1061
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:54,880
entirely likely that people who are in

1062
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:56,590
the hospitality community will read our

1063
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,660
document they wanna they would like to

1064
00:49:56,590 --> 00:50:01,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">see what we want I'm sorry which moon</font>

1065
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:03,759
the hotel the hospitality community um

1066
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:07,509
should must in May doesn't mean to them

1067
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:10,240
what it means to us um as a potential

1068
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:12,550
alternative how about um I like the

1069
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,990
three but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it was nice important</font>

1070
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,970
in mandatory I think that that means

1071
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:18,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">something to people who are not in our</font>

1072
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:20,950
community so I was going to get to the

1073
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,830
actual vocabulary choice as a second

1074
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:25,359
phase big end on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand I think</font>

1075
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:28,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">lose suggestin highlights that</font>

1076
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:30,609
vocabulary matters in this and it's in

1077
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:32,740
fact the reason that I landed on

1078
00:50:30,609 --> 00:50:34,660
thinking we need different words than

1079
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:37,450
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> muston should just we're actually</font>

1080
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:39,670
using them in some ways the must and the

1081
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:41,470
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe it it's similar or the same</font>

1082
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:43,660
the should is completely different

1083
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:46,419
because the concept of trade-offs is in

1084
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:48,190
part of should the semantics of should

1085
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:50,140
is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have to unless you really</font>

1086
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:51,550
know what you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we mean something</font>

1087
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:55,359
completely different for what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1088
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:59,710
the middle category is so a quick hum

1089
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:04,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">lose suggestion uh the suggestion is we</font>

1090
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:12,880
will use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the existing IETF normative</font>

1091
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:18,940
vocabulary those in favor hum yes those

1092
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:23,500
those against hum no not even close to

1093
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:33,190
rough consensus we can get well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm</font>

1094
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:36,910
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh that was a vocabulary one I'm</font>

1095
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:39,310
sorry and yeah yeah yeah well yes okay

1096
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:40,930
yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was um noting that these</font>

1097
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:42,610
suggestions need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> recorded because</font>

1098
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:44,259
they do go out to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list your</font>

1099
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:47,680
decision right we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> note-taker</font>

1100
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:51,730
right yeah okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so Jim</font>

1101
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:56,919
suggestion I'm sorry repeated nice

1102
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:58,840
important mandatory okay the that that's

1103
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:01,720
clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reasonable suggestion there</font>

1104
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:04,390
have been several proposals that get

1105
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:06,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">into that roughly that space I will tell</font>

1106
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:09,009
you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in formulating this and not</font>

1107
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:12,660
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this these slides but leading</font>

1108
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:17,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">up to this I wanted words</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that had a</font>

1109
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:18,850
reasonable intuitive import and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> landed</font>

1110
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:21,580
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> trade-off because that seems to be</font>

1111
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:23,680
the key<font color="#E5E5E5"> semantics to that category if</font>

1112
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:26,170
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the key commit semantics then</font>

1113
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,850
that's the point to discuss so and we

1114
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:31,900
should do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that before we figure on the</font>

1115
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:34,060
label so um just this unit<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe kind of</font>

1116
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:36,250
like I'm not sure if we should go

1117
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:38,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">through the actual book a blur</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1118
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:41,110
more kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of go through first days that</font>

1119
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:43,529
which levels we have do we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> four do</font>

1120
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:46,390
we have three and the ranking order

1121
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:48,610
discussion then we can debate<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1122
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:54,009
vocabulary when we know how many levels

1123
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:56,110
we actually have okay now make one

1124
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:59,830
comment or doe kappa only after you say

1125
00:52:56,110 --> 00:53:02,530
your name Mike<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bishop regardless of</font>

1126
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:05,680
levels you currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> have nice as the</font>

1127
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:08,950
lowest one and we're thinking about

1128
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:10,810
intuitive sense I don't know that nice

1129
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:16,470
really communicates that we would really

1130
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:22,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have these and nice is just ok</font>

1131
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:24,009
ok so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> semantics that I so let me</font>

1132
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:25,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little weird</font>

1133
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:32,380
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chicken and egg</font>

1134
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:33,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">trade off haha pun uh let's decide on</font>

1135
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:38,680
the number and then decide on the

1136
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:40,990
semantic choices are between<font color="#E5E5E5"> four three</font>

1137
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:44,470
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> two I haven't heard anybody lobbying</font>

1138
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:50,078
and oh sorry so there's four three two

1139
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:56,290
and one where well the order the

1140
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:58,000
ordering is one there's one pool so this

1141
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:59,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">is interesting I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asking for a</font>

1142
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,490
clarification I'm going to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1143
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:05,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">listen I interpreted your proposal as</font>

1144
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:09,129
ordered as any number so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> two three</font>

1145
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:11,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">four n and you would order that one two</font>

1146
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:15,609
three four have an ordered list is that

1147
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:19,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">not what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get so what our draft does</font>

1148
00:54:15,609 --> 00:54:22,630
is there's five categories of criteria

1149
00:54:19,569 --> 00:54:25,900
and they're listed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> order so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

1150
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:28,089
would be if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> enter a situation where</font>

1151
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:30,069
you're trading off between two of the

1152
00:54:28,089 --> 00:54:34,210
categories the one that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> listed first</font>

1153
00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:36,849
in the ordering takes precedence berger

1154
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:39,099
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I thought I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heard you say here</font>

1155
00:54:36,849 --> 00:54:42,670
that if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed to add more you would</font>

1156
00:54:39,099 --> 00:54:45,760
add more so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes makes it n is that</font>

1157
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:47,800
a correct interpretation I'm not

1158
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,950
understanding the question solution soon

1159
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:53,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so maybe this young mm maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

1160
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:54,910
paraphrase that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically what he's</font>

1161
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:57,099
saying is that there wouldn't be

1162
00:54:54,910 --> 00:55:01,210
actually a category but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> order itself</font>

1163
00:54:57,099 --> 00:55:03,280
makes the category so if you have five

1164
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:05,619
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a category</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five categories if</font>

1165
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,780
you have 20 you have 20 categories in

1166
00:55:05,619 --> 00:55:09,849
the way the question is that you don't

1167
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:13,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an explicit category where to put</font>

1168
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:15,790
it it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they've also said</font>

1169
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:17,649
this category of one you it's the order

1170
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:20,710
that makes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference yes there are no</font>

1171
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:23,590
labels so<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no like</font>

1172
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:28,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">either so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think their proposed</font>

1173
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:32,120
for the choices would add<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this one</font>

1174
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:34,010
that i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call ordered and and</font>

1175
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,529
it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a number associated but</font>

1176
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:40,070
that's that's the concept of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1177
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:41,630
this is andrew sullivan though and I I

1178
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,710
made this point in the jabber room but I

1179
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:44,330
don't know how it's not coming across

1180
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:46,910
but we've tried different ways so I'll

1181
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:49,040
try again<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the mic on the the other</font>

1182
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:51,440
point though about this is that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1183
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:53,150
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a different strategy it's a</font>

1184
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,180
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> different conception of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1185
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:58,670
job here so so the like enormous bucket

1186
00:55:56,180 --> 00:56:00,410
list is not allowed under the ordered

1187
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:02,750
list the whole point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you get</font>

1188
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:04,430
like five or six that are the things you

1189
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:06,560
trade off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's other and</font>

1190
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:09,080
other like once you get below a certain

1191
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:10,670
level they're just flat and there's no

1192
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,799
like ordering at that point because

1193
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:14,570
they're all just things that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

1194
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,970
trade off against one another and it's

1195
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:18,950
hopeless and and i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that the point</font>

1196
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:21,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that almost everything under three</font>

1197
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:22,520
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in the nice category falls into</font>

1198
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:24,950
this flat category there's no way to

1199
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:26,540
choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> among them and and the point that</font>

1200
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:28,460
we have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to make is that</font>

1201
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:29,630
there are things that are all going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1202
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:31,520
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be traded</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off against one</font>

1203
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:33,710
another and there ought to be some order

1204
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,750
because that's guidance to the IOC<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1205
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:40,520
the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are hey you got a pic</font>

1206
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:43,280
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> longtime participant in the</font>

1207
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:44,990
meetings<font color="#CCCCCC"> committee I'll suggest that</font>

1208
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:48,100
what you're describing doesn't match my

1209
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:52,790
sense of how the actual process works

1210
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:57,529
there there there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a collection of</font>

1211
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:59,900
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we treat as mandatory there</font>

1212
00:56:57,530 --> 00:57:01,460
are some trade-offs that happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

1213
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,960
there are some other goodies which may

1214
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:07,100
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even get talked about although</font>

1215
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:10,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're their desired as and and that</font>

1216
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:11,779
what what we would end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is being</font>

1217
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:14,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">more explicit about this but the really</font>

1218
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:17,600
essential point is the stuff that gets

1219
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:19,820
traded off is not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> large number and the</font>

1220
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:24,589
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> for trading off is actually</font>

1221
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:27,080
difficult or or really easy and the

1222
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:31,810
piece that I never got from your draft

1223
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:34,340
and is that if we land on any

1224
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:36,440
substantial amount of an ordering list

1225
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:38,960
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of trading</font>

1226
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,760
we need an algorithm to go with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that</font>

1227
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:45,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">people understand and believe is</font>

1228
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:47,030
workable and I think we're missing that

1229
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:49,910
now but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you don't think</font>

1230
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:52,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's true for this for the that</font>

1231
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:53,569
categories so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a rank ordering</font>

1232
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:56,440
you would need an algorithm but when you

1233
00:57:53,569 --> 00:57:58,609
have categories you don't I'm sorry Sega

1234
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,020
if you have a rank ordering then you

1235
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:01,279
feel that you need an algorithm but when

1236
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:07,400
you have categories you feel that you

1237
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:09,680
don't you when you say when you have

1238
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:12,410
categories like this mandatory trade-off

1239
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,910
nice so now the definition of mandatory

1240
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:16,879
was straightforward there's no trading

1241
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:18,230
off there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the the middle one was the</font>

1242
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,640
one where there might be trade-offs and

1243
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:21,859
the latter one doesn't play either

1244
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:24,379
because it's not nothing in there is a

1245
00:58:21,859 --> 00:58:26,480
showstopper so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer your</font>

1246
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:29,270
question is for for that one that I've

1247
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:32,240
just described we need an algorithm for

1248
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:36,619
the middle one<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but it's a small</font>

1249
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:38,180
category<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is Melinda I we've been</font>

1250
00:58:36,619 --> 00:58:40,490
having the same discussion for quite

1251
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:42,259
some time now<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it doesn't seem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1252
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:43,848
moving toward resolution so what you

1253
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:46,250
know might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful is to get some</font>

1254
00:58:43,849 --> 00:58:48,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">feedback from other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iao see meaning</font>

1256
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:58,130
what they would actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> find useful in</font>

1259
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:03,410
have a question here it sounds like

1260
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:04,579
we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the engineer thing and we're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">coming into all sorts of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

algorithms and methods and routines but

1263
00:59:07,339 --> 00:59:12,799
to Jim's point earlier part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the goal</font>

1270
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:28,490
here has anyone done a survey of what is

1271
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:31,310
is there a common<font color="#E5E5E5"> practice in the</font>

00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:38,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">that question is that something we</font>

1276
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:40,640
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're coming up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with our Terms</font>

1277
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,800
here of what we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to put in</font>

1278
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,839
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you said contract this and</font>

1279
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:47,240
we're well this discussions pre-contract

1280
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:49,099
you're right but it's it's it's putting

1281
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,770
that it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that process of getting to</font>

1282
00:59:49,099 --> 00:59:51,450
that point

1283
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:53,370
I don't know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering is there are</font>

1284
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:54,990
we arguing about something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

1285
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:56,490
speaking French when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who may</font>

1286
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:58,950
consume this out there are looking for

1287
00:59:56,490 --> 01:00:01,919
German you know something so in in

1288
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:03,899
response to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Melinda's query I think we</font>

1289
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:08,040
have three meetings committee members

1290
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:11,970
here and I'm I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> intentionally leaving</font>

1291
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:14,220
out staff to not be not to exclude them

1292
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:18,959
from participating but to not put them

1293
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:20,520
on the spot the politics of staff

1294
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,200
participation is always different than

1295
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:25,800
the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us you're not allowed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1296
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:27,779
shoot its staff for example anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1297
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:32,460
and clearly you're required to shoot at

1298
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:35,130
us speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Laura I'm happy no one's</font>

1299
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:36,840
gonna shoot at me Laura Nugent I just

1300
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:39,270
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention from an operational</font>

1301
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:42,090
perspective I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think two categories would</font>

1302
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:43,860
be the best you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have required which are</font>

1303
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:46,110
not negotiable and you have desired

1304
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:47,040
which are ultimately negotiable that'll

1305
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:50,520
be clear to people that you're working

1306
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:53,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">with in the hotel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> etc industries but</font>

1307
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:55,470
also from my perspective operationally

1308
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:57,720
very clear as well as I know what is

1309
01:00:55,470 --> 01:01:02,310
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> required and where people can</font>

1310
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:04,799
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> judgment in to assess things so</font>

1311
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:05,940
turns out the reason that I'm I think

1312
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,520
two would be great<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we could do that</font>

1313
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:11,190
the reason that I'm in favor of three

1314
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:14,220
rather than two is there's a separate

1315
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:15,750
negotiation yep you cited the hotel

1316
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:18,450
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for that that's just fine</font>

1317
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:21,200
there's also the ITF community and the

1318
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:23,700
point behind the third category<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1319
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,290
that's not a negotiation we decide

1320
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,970
what's in that pool and after that

1321
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:30,840
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get to complain if we don't</font>

1322
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:32,939
satisfy it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it helps our ability</font>

1323
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:37,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">to push back on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the community for some</font>

1324
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:39,750
set of issues this is Lou burger<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1325
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:42,569
actually found a prior come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Laura</font>

1326
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:44,700
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful because I understand the</font>

1327
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:47,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">need for mandatory if you don't meet</font>

1328
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:51,569
that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go I understand the nice</font>

1329
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:52,920
that means it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wish list and it's</font>

1330
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:56,250
important because that's where things

1331
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:57,690
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't fit mandatory go and I didn't</font>

1332
01:01:56,250 --> 01:02:01,140
understand the desirable but I think she

1333
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:03,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">just helped what us understand what the</font>

1334
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:06,150
definition of desirable should be is

1335
01:02:03,089 --> 01:02:07,799
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that come in to the</font>

1336
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:09,630
negotiation and that's a helpful

1337
01:02:07,799 --> 01:02:12,210
definition if that's one we want to go

1338
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:14,369
with but I do think we need three<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1339
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:15,779
particular we need an answer of when it

1340
01:02:14,369 --> 01:02:17,910
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit the first to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mandatory</font>

1341
01:02:15,779 --> 01:02:20,039
or this up this desirable where does it

1342
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:21,589
go so we we know where that fits as

1343
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:24,869
opposed to we have forgotten<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

1344
01:02:21,589 --> 01:02:27,808
yeah so I'll close to my clients after

1345
01:02:24,869 --> 01:02:29,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after last one on the mic and the</font>

1346
01:02:27,809 --> 01:02:32,150
kind of like I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

1347
01:02:29,339 --> 01:02:35,940
some humming most probably after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1348
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:37,710
go ahead so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Glenn Dean again I'm going</font>

1349
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:41,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the discussion i'm</font>

1350
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:43,680
hearing between<font color="#CCCCCC"> alyssa's and document in</font>

1351
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:45,420
this document is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again coming</font>

1352
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:48,328
back to this idea that we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1353
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:51,660
be very detailed and create the

1354
01:02:48,329 --> 01:02:53,400
algorithm for the negotiation and the

1355
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:55,499
algorithm for evaluating like the

1356
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,380
decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> i really think that's the one</font>

1357
01:02:55,499 --> 01:03:00,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">direction i think it's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to lead to</font>

1358
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:02,910
you will never get this done this is

1359
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:05,009
guidance from the community to the

1360
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:06,359
meetings committee and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ioc they're</font>

1361
01:03:05,009 --> 01:03:08,069
the ones that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go negotiate</font>

1362
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:09,690
the contracts we're not telling them how

1363
01:03:08,069 --> 01:03:10,979
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that without telling them the</font>

1364
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:13,200
language they need to use in the

1365
01:03:10,979 --> 01:03:16,078
contracts or give<font color="#CCCCCC"> them guidance in our</font>

1366
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:18,899
words in our opinions on what we the

1367
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:21,299
community want in a meeting venue it's

1368
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:23,880
that simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we keep it simple</font>

1369
01:03:21,299 --> 01:03:26,130
like that and we can tell there's things

1370
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:28,469
we view as mandatory there are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1371
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:29,910
view as we're flexible on it and there's

1372
01:03:28,469 --> 01:03:31,950
things that if you can give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

1373
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:35,910
that'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> great but i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> live without</font>

1374
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:37,259
it and let's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> get so mired in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DC</font>

1375
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:40,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">love try to create algorithms that all</font>

1376
01:03:37,259 --> 01:03:45,660
idea I like the mandatory trade-off nice

1377
01:03:40,109 --> 01:03:48,538
thing for what it's worth<font color="#CCCCCC"> jim martin</font>

1378
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:51,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm meetings committee as well but</font>

1379
01:03:48,539 --> 01:03:53,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm speaking as an individual the the</font>

1380
01:03:51,719 --> 01:03:55,499
truth here is that I fear that we're

1381
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:56,819
desperately again just echoing other

1382
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:58,259
people trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into an</font>

1383
01:03:56,819 --> 01:04:00,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">algorithm and really fundamentally what</font>

1384
01:03:58,259 --> 01:04:02,130
we're trying to do is say these are the

1385
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:05,339
things we believe this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we think</font>

1386
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:07,589
is important and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not trying to to</font>

1387
01:04:05,339 --> 01:04:10,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">out to come up with an algorithm or a</font>

1388
01:04:07,589 --> 01:04:11,819
process we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to say when you're</font>

1389
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:16,200
doing your work here are the things that

1390
01:04:11,819 --> 01:04:16,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">you should keep in mind and so as we as</font>

1391
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,939
we go through here

1392
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:20,200
and break it down I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

1393
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:22,570
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't make this too complicated</font>

1394
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:24,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">because otherwise this ends up largely</font>

1395
01:04:22,570 --> 01:04:26,170
being a bat from somebody who's unhappy

1396
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:27,610
with the selection to say hey you you

1397
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:29,860
miss two point three point seven and

1398
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:31,180
that was a you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were three</font>

1399
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:34,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">trade-offs there and you really should</font>

1400
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:35,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">have taken care of me I I don't think we</font>

1401
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:37,450
want to go down that road I think what

1402
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:39,580
we want to do is make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure it's clear to</font>

1403
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:41,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">the mains committee folks what it what</font>

1404
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:43,390
it is that the community wants and then

1405
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:45,010
let them do the best they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give us</font>

1406
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:50,589
the best thing we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they can</font>

1407
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:53,020
find so the the one push back I mean I

1408
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:57,369
agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with everything you said up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

1409
01:04:53,020 --> 01:05:00,460
end and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the challenge here is the</font>

1410
01:04:57,369 --> 01:05:03,190
danger of getting it wrong and post hoc

1411
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:05,260
having the community get upset or and

1412
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:08,800
this is the important operational point

1413
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:10,840
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> danger of having to consult the</font>

1414
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:14,050
community constantly because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1415
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:16,030
sure and so part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal here is</font>

1416
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:17,880
that that clarity that you're talking

1417
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:20,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">about where the meetings committee</font>

1418
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:23,020
believes it has a sufficient

1419
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:26,950
understanding of the community desires

1420
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:28,660
or needs or requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> I means that</font>

1421
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:31,480
the meetings committee does not feel

1422
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:34,000
that or the IOC doesn't feel that it has

1423
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:38,980
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the community very often</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

1424
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:41,740
something resolved thank you Michael

1425
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:43,030
funny and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to kind of jump back a</font>

1426
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:46,240
bit to Lauren when it comes to

1427
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:48,700
implementation keep in mind who you are

1428
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:51,009
negotiating with some of these items

1429
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:53,350
listed you can easily you're negotiating

1430
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:57,040
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotel and it's either a yes or a</font>

1431
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:59,140
No some<font color="#E5E5E5"> items listed are non-negotiable</font>

1432
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:00,880
you're not going to negotiate with the

1433
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:02,830
country<font color="#CCCCCC"> about who gets access or not</font>

1434
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,869
that's a negotiation we're having with

1435
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:07,029
the community ourselves the hotel isn't

1436
01:06:04,869 --> 01:06:09,070
gonna open the grocery store there is a

1437
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:10,840
grocery store we find it sets a factory

1438
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:12,700
there isn't a grocery store we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1439
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:15,609
find<font color="#CCCCCC"> it satisfactory that's an internal</font>

1440
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:17,410
negotiation when it comes to hotels it's

1441
01:06:15,609 --> 01:06:20,740
fairly simple we need this this and this

1442
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:22,810
here we're able to negotiate and take it

1443
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:24,279
or leave it and and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when you</font>

1444
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:25,900
start categorizing when you start

1445
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,550
implementing keep in mind who you are

1446
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:29,580
negotiating with that's what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

1447
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,580
take

1448
01:06:31,109 --> 01:06:37,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's time to at least try</font>

1449
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:40,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do some decision-making so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1450
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:43,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that what we have is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four options so</font>

1451
01:06:40,569 --> 01:06:47,890
category of for category categories of

1452
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:52,150
three categories of two and instead of

1453
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:56,650
that having a relatively short ranking

1454
01:06:52,150 --> 01:07:02,500
order and then a category of flat things

1455
01:06:56,650 --> 01:07:05,290
associated with that um and so let's try

1456
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:08,650
this I did not sure if this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1457
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:10,990
work but let's see um perhaps perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1458
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:13,569
this as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pass decision process</font>

1459
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:15,790
looking for the two strongest and then

1460
01:07:13,569 --> 01:07:18,490
and then right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that its most</font>

1461
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:20,710
probably right to be um let's try first

1462
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:26,109
of the four categories hum if you like

1463
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:31,180
that well that's as quietly girl at

1464
01:07:26,109 --> 01:07:33,040
least one down um then I'll let's try

1465
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:42,750
three categories how many if you like

1466
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:50,589
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay two categories ok and then</font>

1467
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:53,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">rank order so I think we have a decision</font>

1468
01:07:50,589 --> 01:07:55,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">point to make between three categories</font>

1469
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:57,130
and the ranking order those seem to be

1470
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:59,859
the closest to each other so I'm like

1471
01:07:57,130 --> 01:08:02,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first one was quite clear and then</font>

1472
01:07:59,859 --> 01:08:04,240
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hindon on the microphone I'm</font>

1473
01:08:02,619 --> 01:08:07,510
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask I don't know if that's a</font>

1474
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:09,549
another fine question Bob hinted so we

1475
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:11,710
won thought I think after Laura

1476
01:08:09,549 --> 01:08:13,240
suggested to is I mean you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

1477
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:16,120
and then well the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

1478
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:18,068
think you have to rank order if you if

1479
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:21,040
you had a second category you could rank

1480
01:08:18,069 --> 01:08:23,650
order things in that so it's these are

1481
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:27,790
not necessarily alternative choices

1482
01:08:23,649 --> 01:08:29,948
these of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do things inside</font>

1483
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:32,319
of these as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> but let's try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1484
01:08:29,948 --> 01:08:35,460
take the kind of broad approach first

1485
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:40,029
that where we have the categories but

1486
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:42,189
not ranked order over the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> list but</font>

1487
01:08:40,029 --> 01:08:44,109
then you can do things inside those

1488
01:08:42,189 --> 01:08:47,769
categories if you want to

1489
01:08:44,109 --> 01:08:49,779
but or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a snow day alternative that we</font>

1490
01:08:47,770 --> 01:08:54,159
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those three categories but we</font>

1491
01:08:49,779 --> 01:08:56,139
have a ranked order so what's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear</font>

1492
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:58,028
or did I just confuse the heck of a

1493
01:08:56,139 --> 01:09:02,440
computer check off Melinda but that's

1494
01:08:58,029 --> 01:09:08,799
fine so let's try first with the three

1495
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:13,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">categories hum the second torrentus</font>

1496
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:17,618
ranking order yeah so the first is three

1497
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:24,549
categories and the next is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't</font>

1498
01:09:17,618 --> 01:09:26,939
an order it's very rough the kind of

1499
01:09:24,549 --> 01:09:28,988
like there is some very slight

1500
01:09:26,939 --> 01:09:32,019
difference in that I don't know really

1501
01:09:28,988 --> 01:09:34,568
where to go from there I think we most

1502
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:38,049
probably need oh but some people do

1503
01:09:34,569 --> 01:09:40,600
that's good well where I know not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

1504
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:43,109
is to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine this based on out</font>

1505
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:46,119
loud<font color="#E5E5E5"> thumbs work it's very clear we have</font>

1506
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:48,339
significance constituents constituencies

1507
01:09:46,118 --> 01:09:52,028
for both and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with the</font>

1508
01:09:48,339 --> 01:09:54,699
objections not just the numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> blue</font>

1509
01:09:52,029 --> 01:09:56,639
burger whatever the end result between

1510
01:09:54,699 --> 01:09:58,780
this it's really important have

1511
01:09:56,639 --> 01:10:01,210
documented their criteria which are

1512
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:04,420
absolutes for the community we have to

1513
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:07,119
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> document that says if this is not</font>

1514
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:09,179
met we don't go there that's really

1515
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:12,639
important whether the rest of the stuff

1516
01:10:09,179 --> 01:10:15,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's optimization but that first one we</font>

1517
01:10:12,639 --> 01:10:18,850
go there<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bell community we've done our</font>

1518
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:21,130
job<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong so so so my prediction is</font>

1519
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:22,360
given how close those two were is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1520
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:24,969
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to resolve this today</font>

1521
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:26,619
but we might help a lot if we can

1522
01:10:24,969 --> 01:10:30,940
resolve it that's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> but but I</font>

1523
01:10:26,619 --> 01:10:33,670
suspect we won't and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm appreciative</font>

1524
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:36,519
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Barry raising this point which was</font>

1525
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:39,040
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting points in a P</font>

1526
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:41,290
Resnick's document and that is that one

1527
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:45,699
way to pursue these kinds of impasses is

1528
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:49,000
to be carefully discuss the objections

1529
01:10:45,699 --> 01:10:51,909
and deal with those substantively and so

1530
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,190
for example on the rank ordering one of

1531
01:10:51,909 --> 01:10:57,170
my objections is I actually don't know

1532
01:10:54,190 --> 01:11:00,259
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process of using it will be</font>

1533
01:10:57,170 --> 01:11:02,170
and worse than that my sense of the

1534
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:05,000
research history and operational history

1535
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:06,710
in general with rank ordered decision

1536
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:11,650
making is that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1537
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:17,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's unstable so at a minimum we need a</font>

1538
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:17,019
will specified algorithm for using that

1539
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:22,100
yaya co NHA kyria me hats for this this

1540
01:11:20,179 --> 01:11:24,199
comment that first ally<font color="#E5E5E5"> i fully agree</font>

1541
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:26,960
with Barry's comment that that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1542
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:28,969
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's not just the</font>

1543
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:31,880
objections but I'm not totally convinced

1544
01:11:28,969 --> 01:11:34,550
that that everybody completely

1545
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:36,110
understands what we actually are talking

1546
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:39,520
about here what the implications oh it

1547
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:42,349
might be we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of presenting a choice</font>

1548
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,640
but the actual issues are someone else

1549
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:46,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">for its to give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you an example of that</font>

1550
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:47,540
and I mean I been sort of resisting

1551
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:49,339
coming to the microphone and providing

1552
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:52,790
my own opinions but that's providing one

1553
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:55,790
example those<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really only one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

1554
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:58,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">so why I liked atlases and Andrews</font>

1555
01:11:55,790 --> 01:12:00,199
document was<font color="#E5E5E5"> study it was I'm a simple</font>

1556
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:02,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">minded man I can only hold so many</font>

1557
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:04,040
things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my head and it really provided</font>

1558
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:06,860
you know the clear things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1559
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:10,190
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get right and in a 25</font>

1560
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:13,250
first things and and it was good for

1561
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:15,320
that and so there's that and then you

1562
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:17,960
another approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be more of a lone</font>

1563
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:20,980
release thing which is no far harder to

1564
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:23,960
keep in your head and get get correct so

1565
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:26,030
it's not necessarily just on the

1566
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:27,710
question of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> you label things and</font>

1567
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:30,800
whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have prior the order or</font>

1568
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:34,190
label might be a little bit of a mixture

1569
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:36,290
of other things as well thank you the

1570
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:39,290
devil here Andrew the devil here is in

1571
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:41,660
the details so like I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1572
01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:43,850
be put together but we need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

1573
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:45,710
more text and see through to agree and

1574
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:47,960
by the way people who will execute on

1575
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:50,510
that should really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have enough input</font>

1576
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:54,160
because they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to somehow make</font>

1577
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:54,160
this happen in the real life

1578
01:12:56,699 --> 01:13:02,848
I mean may I suggest an approach that

1579
01:13:00,329 --> 01:13:04,949
might help here and that is to go

1580
01:13:02,849 --> 01:13:06,809
through the current draft and pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1581
01:13:04,949 --> 01:13:09,629
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single slide or something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they'd</font>

1582
01:13:06,809 --> 01:13:12,289
be sensitive analyst<font color="#CCCCCC"> the break out of</font>

1583
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:15,479
this is what's mandatory bang bang bang

1584
01:13:12,289 --> 01:13:18,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">34 whatever items it is this is what</font>

1585
01:13:15,479 --> 01:13:20,099
would be a trade-off amount let people

1586
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:22,199
see them this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be what would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fall</font>

1587
01:13:20,099 --> 01:13:23,940
into the nice category if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1588
01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:26,879
see what that looks like we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> may</font>

1589
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:31,860
just go yeah that feels<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I'm pretty</font>

1590
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:35,880
good with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so those who are on the</font>

1591
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:37,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">microphone continue but i think we are</font>

1592
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:40,499
running out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time soon and we have to</font>

1593
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:41,670
go to talk about suresh's draft a little

1594
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:43,559
bit as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think we can</font>

1595
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:46,199
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> see side it this time but</font>

1596
01:13:43,559 --> 01:13:49,650
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'll talk really fast so beer</font>

1597
01:13:46,199 --> 01:13:51,869
bottle<font color="#E5E5E5"> no so I'm going to talk a little</font>

1598
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:53,879
bit about my objection to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rank</font>

1599
01:13:51,869 --> 01:13:55,348
ordering that document I did provide

1600
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:58,289
feedback on that document in that

1601
01:13:55,349 --> 01:13:59,699
document as it is now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll do miserable</font>

1602
01:13:58,289 --> 01:14:01,739
things in terms of the food requirements

1603
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:03,119
right it will not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be satisfied with that</font>

1604
01:14:01,739 --> 01:14:04,530
one so we'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a lot of work on</font>

1605
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:06,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the more work we did on</font>

1606
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:11,429
that the more it might start looking

1607
01:14:06,030 --> 01:14:14,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">like the one we have right now Alyssa</font>

1608
01:14:11,429 --> 01:14:17,610
Cooper um I I kind of liked your

1609
01:14:14,459 --> 01:14:20,459
suggestion Bob of the merge because I

1610
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:22,228
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the problems with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rank</font>

1611
01:14:20,459 --> 01:14:24,119
ordering document<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right now is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1612
01:14:22,229 --> 01:14:26,519
you know which items that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> strictly</font>

1613
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:28,139
mandatory is not clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think it</font>

1614
01:14:26,519 --> 01:14:30,719
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be totally feasible to do a</font>

1615
01:14:28,139 --> 01:14:33,119
mandatory bucket a trade-off bucket that

1616
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:35,519
is ordered and then another flat bucket

1617
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:38,728
below so that might might be one

1618
01:14:35,519 --> 01:14:40,889
approach but just to respond to to

1619
01:14:38,729 --> 01:14:43,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">Glenn's point there's a bunch of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> items</font>

1620
01:14:40,889 --> 01:14:46,349
in this document which for which the

1621
01:14:43,019 --> 01:14:48,360
label is currently unclear<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's I</font>

1622
01:14:46,349 --> 01:14:50,010
think part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the issue is that we</font>

1623
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:52,110
couldn't just pull<font color="#E5E5E5"> them all out and and</font>

1624
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:54,719
sort them right now because you know

1625
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:56,249
Davis annotated it with like it's not

1626
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:58,349
obvious which one this should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in and</font>

1627
01:14:56,249 --> 01:14:59,849
so I think that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1628
01:14:58,349 --> 01:15:01,590
difficulty as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said in particular with</font>

1629
01:14:59,849 --> 01:15:04,289
the ones for<font color="#E5E5E5"> which the criteria is</font>

1630
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:06,150
acceptable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the community I don't know</font>

1631
01:15:04,289 --> 01:15:10,139
how you evaluate that or trade it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

1632
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:11,040
against anything else right now Jim

1633
01:15:10,139 --> 01:15:13,140
Martin

1634
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:15,480
to that point as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Glenn's</font>

1635
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:17,100
point when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do establish the set of</font>

1636
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:18,389
mandatories i think is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

1637
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:20,340
that we then go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1638
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:22,230
we did really early in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process which</font>

1639
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:23,720
is map it against meetings we've had in

1640
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:25,980
meetings that we've got and make sure

1641
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:27,780
after we say hey these are the mandatory

1642
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:29,790
things which of the ones that we had

1643
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:31,440
successful meetings at wouldn't we be

1644
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:33,570
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do under the new rules because</font>

1645
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:38,879
if that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case we might want to</font>

1646
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:41,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">double check</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our thoughts thank you for</font>

1647
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:43,230
suggesting that it was helpful when it

1648
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:46,320
was done before<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it would it will be</font>

1649
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:48,599
again yeah ray<font color="#CCCCCC"> pelletier I think you</font>

1650
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:49,440
know take a home on Melissa suggestion I

1651
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:52,290
think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right way to go</font>

1652
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:55,500
mandatory the rank order<font color="#CCCCCC"> trade-off and</font>

1653
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:59,730
and the flat list<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nice thing I think</font>

1654
01:15:55,500 --> 01:16:01,140
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in this very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Barnes and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

1655
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:03,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say it's the follow up on Jim's</font>

1656
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:04,320
comment about go back to pass meetings

1657
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:07,980
I've actually done that for the food

1658
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:09,900
thing so barely but rather than taking a

1659
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:12,540
hum on that as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ray said why don't we try</font>

1660
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:14,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">just writing it up and seeing what it</font>

1661
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:16,680
looks like and letting us see it and see

1662
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,690
what it would like it yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

1663
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:20,310
sounds like a good way forward then we

1664
01:16:18,690 --> 01:16:22,799
know actually what we are discussing

1665
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:25,590
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we are not and then we can do</font>

1666
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:27,780
more informed decision I think we really

1667
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to move on on this point Bob is</font>

1668
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:31,650
this absolutely necessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> have more</font>

1669
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:33,390
global comment so can the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next version</font>

1670
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:35,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the document be like a single</font>

1671
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:37,920
document because I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> trouble reading</font>

1672
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:39,540
it there's like the first part and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1673
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:42,650
there's parts which I think from the

1674
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:45,530
other document and there's also

1675
01:16:42,650 --> 01:16:48,450
redundancy can we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a single</font>

1676
01:16:45,530 --> 01:16:50,730
document to review so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure what</font>

1677
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:52,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't a single document i do</font>

1678
01:16:50,730 --> 01:16:55,709
know that it that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> version that's out</font>

1679
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:57,179
there now is fragmented<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some ways</font>

1680
01:16:55,710 --> 01:16:59,790
which may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be what you mean yeah i think</font>

1681
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:02,100
i've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a fair amount of what I</font>

1682
01:16:59,790 --> 01:17:06,390
hope is<font color="#E5E5E5"> cleanup work it certainly meant</font>

1683
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:07,920
to be um and um it doesn't it doesn't

1684
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:09,960
put everything into a single pool

1685
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:14,520
because there's some other benefits and

1686
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:16,770
having sections for areas uh but it

1687
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:19,560
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a lot cleaner for people to</font>

1688
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:22,380
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what the choices are from</font>

1689
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:23,820
the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> recent draft I in reading and I</font>

1690
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:24,420
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was a little confused because</font>

1691
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:26,070
I was reading

1692
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:28,080
sort of the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have been</font>

1693
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:29,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to look for redundancies I</font>

1694
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:34,760
probably didn't get all of them but I

1695
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:37,410
tried to get the ones I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um</font>

1696
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:39,210
you had more slides the question is do

1697
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:43,110
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go what's the next slide uh</font>

1698
01:17:39,210 --> 01:17:46,410
oh yes thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I know why you want</font>

1699
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:48,960
this long yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so so there's a</font>

1700
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:54,590
speaking of process the process for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1701
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:58,620
draft is I will be releasing a dash 0 3

1702
01:17:54,590 --> 01:18:03,989
which is my best take and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will fold in</font>

1703
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:07,980
what I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> from today and from going</font>

1704
01:18:03,989 --> 01:18:10,830
forward the basic model is people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

1705
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:14,730
are requesting changes need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font>

1706
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:16,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">as an editing directive and and then of</font>

1707
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:25,199
course people need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to support the change</font>

1708
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:28,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that a reasonable summary lieu of blue</font>

1709
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:31,230
burger I think it's reasonable but it

1710
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:32,670
loses its one nuance is discussions

1711
01:18:31,230 --> 01:18:34,500
great we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should have them we're not</font>

1712
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:36,390
suggesting stopping them but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end</font>

1713
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:38,880
of the discussion we have to understand

1714
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:41,489
what the resolution of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the discussion is</font>

1715
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:43,290
if it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> text meaning</font>

1716
01:18:41,489 --> 01:18:45,239
after we have a nice long discussion we

1717
01:18:43,290 --> 01:18:46,860
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that says okay this is</font>

1718
01:18:45,239 --> 01:18:48,468
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> text that's going to change based on</font>

1719
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:51,540
the discussion does everyone agree and

1720
01:18:48,469 --> 01:18:53,370
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we end without that just without such</font>

1721
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:54,840
a change the discussion has<font color="#E5E5E5"> just been a</font>

1722
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:56,190
nice thing and we've documented on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1723
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:58,739
list but there's no change to the

1724
01:18:56,190 --> 01:19:01,559
document because without us agreeing to

1725
01:18:58,739 --> 01:19:03,839
the specific change we as authors and

1726
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:06,840
editors can't necessarily interpret what

1727
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:10,880
the decision is of the working group

1728
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:10,880
right and there's a slide after this

1729
01:19:14,030 --> 01:19:24,599
this I took this as a variation of the

1730
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:25,800
previous slide just to help people you

1731
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,929
can tell where these last two slides

1732
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:29,310
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> out sorry I put them together these</font>

1733
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:32,160
slides together based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a conversation</font>

1734
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:33,870
we had among the authors including Laura

1735
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:37,380
Laura there was a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good point</font>

1736
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:41,610
where which came for

1737
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:45,659
staff which is we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that</font>

1738
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:47,670
we give direction to the professionals

1739
01:19:45,659 --> 01:19:49,230
but also allow the professionals to do

1740
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:53,250
their job<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we've heard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

1741
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:55,980
about that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the comments relative to</font>

1742
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:58,650
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IAO see you know let's let the IOC</font>

1743
01:19:55,980 --> 01:20:00,928
members do their job but we as the

1744
01:19:58,650 --> 01:20:03,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">community including the IOC have to let</font>

1745
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:04,679
the professionals do their job too so we

1746
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:08,670
have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensitive to that in our</font>

1747
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:11,909
language yeah I not sure I completely

1748
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:14,520
understand the last two slides but Dave

1749
01:20:11,909 --> 01:20:16,589
I'm kind of like eager to see what that

1750
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:18,719
means in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> written text then in the</font>

1751
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:21,210
next time so then we know what we're

1752
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:24,659
talking about thank you very much I

1753
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:27,870
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that now it's I hope that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1754
01:20:24,659 --> 01:20:30,809
authors have co-authors have now enough

1755
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:32,040
guidance to go on by this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I would</font>

1756
01:20:30,810 --> 01:20:45,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to go to the next topic which</font>

1757
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:48,810
Suresh hi my name is Suresh like i'm the

1758
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:51,060
author of like another document in this

1759
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:52,800
working group like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm pretty sure like</font>

1760
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:54,389
most people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not seen it and because</font>

1761
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:57,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">i haven't received any comments on it</font>

1762
01:20:54,389 --> 01:20:59,420
since the last meeting so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1763
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:03,409
two possibilities like one of them is um

1764
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:06,929
it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> good to go all ready to go and</font>

1765
01:21:03,409 --> 01:21:09,000
it's a bit doubtful so I I really would

1766
01:21:06,929 --> 01:21:10,260
request like people do read<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document</font>

1767
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and provide some comments so there was</font>

1768
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:13,590
like a round of comments like before the

1769
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,510
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting and I did incorporate them</font>

1770
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:21,139
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that it's been like crickets</font>

1771
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:23,219
like and next<font color="#E5E5E5"> time he's thanks so um</font>

1772
01:21:21,139 --> 01:21:24,929
like I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to put down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font>

1773
01:21:23,219 --> 01:21:27,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason like why there's like two</font>

1774
01:21:24,929 --> 01:21:29,400
documents at the beginning and not one

1775
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:30,870
document was that this the duck like

1776
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:32,638
daft question was supposed to be like

1777
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:35,340
the high-level policy that doesn't

1778
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:38,489
change very frequently and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft</font>

1779
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:40,860
Baker which is no draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDF what's the</font>

1780
01:21:38,489 --> 01:21:43,830
one which specified the gory details of

1781
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:45,570
things and that like could change like

1782
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:47,489
in a shorter time period than this like

1783
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:51,049
overall policy so that's why they were

1784
01:21:47,489 --> 01:21:53,780
two documents it's like so

1785
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:56,570
as I said like other like discussion is

1786
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:58,160
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work group document which is like</font>

1787
01:21:56,570 --> 01:22:00,380
very good because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

1788
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:02,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">that done but I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

1789
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:04,610
like if there's anything for me to do to

1790
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:06,530
get this other document done s also the

1791
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:08,179
options are you just like fold it all in

1792
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:13,610
into one document that's not that's a

1793
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:15,740
possibility our work with like alyssa

1794
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:18,130
has document and like Aunt Rose document

1795
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:20,090
and like mud<font color="#E5E5E5"> something in from there are</font>

1796
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:22,070
whatever the working group wants to do

1797
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:23,510
but like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me what the</font>

1798
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:25,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">next steps are for me to do so I just</font>

1799
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:29,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">like want to come up here and stand here</font>

1800
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:32,360
like and take the tomatoes yeah so just

1801
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:34,400
to remind everybody so in our charter we

1802
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:37,210
have these<font color="#E5E5E5"> two separate documents one is</font>

1803
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:40,400
policy and one is to the process and the

1804
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:42,050
and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is our current</font>

1805
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:44,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">charter I'm sure that that can be</font>

1806
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:47,090
changed if there's enough pressure to do

1807
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:49,460
that but just to remind you<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

1808
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:52,460
discussion that that's the original

1809
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:54,380
direction that we took so Mary para

1810
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:56,240
liebe that what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just said Young is</font>

1811
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:58,880
one of the reasons I don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font>

1812
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:00,980
document specifics in charters but i

1813
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the iesg would be open to letting</font>

1814
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:05,059
you merge them without reach our during

1815
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:06,769
anyway I I think they should go in one

1816
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:09,110
document it's silly to have a small

1817
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:12,470
document with us in the rationale that

1818
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:14,750
Suresh gave of changing fast or changing

1819
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:17,360
slow doesn't seem to apply to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me because</font>

1820
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:20,020
once either document comes out as an RFC

1821
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:22,880
there's a process to change it and I

1822
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:26,840
would rather see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this be put into the</font>

1823
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:28,850
other thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> Barry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Andrew Andrew</font>

1824
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:31,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sullivan I had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually exactly the</font>

1825
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:33,230
opposite reaction which is you're not

1826
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:36,260
getting feedback on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's</font>

1827
01:23:33,230 --> 01:23:37,879
ready last call it and ship it as far as

1828
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:40,370
I can tell this is a this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a simple</font>

1829
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:42,530
thing but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> policy about you</font>

1830
01:23:40,370 --> 01:23:44,210
know how we're going to travel<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

1831
01:23:42,530 --> 01:23:46,219
the world not how we're going to decide

1832
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:50,930
where we go when we go there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank</font>

1833
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:52,730
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks Dave Tim Crocker I'd</font>

1834
01:23:50,930 --> 01:23:56,720
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say one document rather than two</font>

1835
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:59,209
and my main reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that having two</font>

1836
01:23:56,720 --> 01:24:02,900
documents lets us get divergent about

1837
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:04,090
what conforms to which or what doesn't

1838
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:05,769
give enough practical

1839
01:24:04,090 --> 01:24:08,889
guidance whereas if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in a single</font>

1840
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:10,239
document we can move towards convergence

1841
01:24:08,889 --> 01:24:12,670
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meaning of the high-level</font>

1842
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:16,780
statements and the low-level directives

1843
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:19,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank you daddy yeah track of the</font>

1844
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:21,250
first coma that I have this is with my

1845
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:23,500
hat on that's the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the group</font>

1846
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:24,969
whatever you guys want to do in this

1847
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:26,800
working group you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we'll listen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1848
01:24:24,969 --> 01:24:29,080
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if you want one</font>

1849
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:31,000
document or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 that that that's you know</font>

1850
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:34,449
we can discuss that I probably can be

1851
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:37,119
arranged and then a personal comment

1852
01:24:34,449 --> 01:24:40,119
without the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hat I see a lot of value in</font>

1853
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:41,259
in modular documents and saying a

1854
01:24:40,119 --> 01:24:44,769
different thing in a different document

1855
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:47,320
and you know it's not necessarily clear

1856
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:49,000
to me that we have in everything's lined

1857
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:52,840
up in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the other document and</font>

1858
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:54,280
ready to go either so I I'd be you know

1859
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:57,280
personally interested in getting this

1860
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:58,869
this forward and plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 what enters</font>

1861
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:02,019
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this this one's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ready</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1862
01:24:58,869 --> 01:25:04,540
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually agree on that and and we</font>

1863
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:06,580
do realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's lots of detail</font>

1864
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:08,409
on how we actually select those places

1865
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:10,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's why we have the other</font>

1866
01:25:08,409 --> 01:25:11,559
document it's not that this document

1867
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:15,310
claims that we have all that detail but

1868
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:19,150
it's their overall policy thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1869
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:23,020
to be asked on room working I USC head

1870
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:25,690
off so personally my feeling is here

1871
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:27,429
let's let's get this out and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1872
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:31,239
comment or one question maybe to

1873
01:25:27,429 --> 01:25:33,670
consider and that is sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> we come</font>

1874
01:25:31,239 --> 01:25:37,750
to the question whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do these</font>

1875
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:40,150
11 11 policies or whether that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in</font>

1876
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:42,250
conflict with actually selection of the

1877
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:44,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">venue like if there is no venue that</font>

1878
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:47,080
fulfills the process requirements

1879
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:50,380
available like there is a conflict

1880
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:52,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">between these two policy and process and</font>

1881
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:54,520
I don't know where we tackle that or

1882
01:25:52,989 --> 01:25:56,440
whether we need to tackle<font color="#E5E5E5"> that or</font>

1883
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:58,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever so that might be a little bit</font>

1884
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:01,360
an argument for putting both in one but

1885
01:25:58,510 --> 01:26:03,520
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> so just to answer you to be as like</font>

1886
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:06,940
there's actually takes in the draft like

1887
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:08,770
if it actually talks about 11 1 star not

1888
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:10,780
being like on a calendar year basis

1889
01:26:08,770 --> 01:26:12,429
right so if you have like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's if you</font>

1890
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:14,409
have a problem finding a venue like in a

1891
01:26:12,429 --> 01:26:17,889
year the idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to balance it out right</font>

1892
01:26:14,409 --> 01:26:19,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">so that's the policy so it's not really</font>

1893
01:26:17,889 --> 01:26:23,079
flick but it's something that has to be

1894
01:26:19,179 --> 01:26:26,199
balanced I hear you I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine a</font>

1895
01:26:23,079 --> 01:26:28,539
process draft that will make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it even</font>

1896
01:26:26,199 --> 01:26:31,329
within two years or three years quite

1897
01:26:28,539 --> 01:26:33,579
difficult depending on what's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1898
01:26:31,329 --> 01:26:36,090
process draft to fulfill the policy I'm

1899
01:26:33,579 --> 01:26:39,429
just saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that from an abstract point</font>

1900
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:41,860
so that's kind of thought by maybe both

1901
01:26:39,429 --> 01:26:44,590
can be useful in one but I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1902
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:47,799
no strong opinion just wanna get ready

1903
01:26:44,590 --> 01:26:50,320
Barry again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have an idea Andrew and</font>

1904
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:52,179
Yali what would you think of as you say

1905
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:55,478
cutting this one sending it out it's

1906
01:26:52,179 --> 01:26:57,159
ready when but also incorporating it

1907
01:26:55,479 --> 01:26:58,570
into the other document and when that

1908
01:26:57,159 --> 01:27:00,659
document is published have it obsolete

1909
01:26:58,570 --> 01:27:05,289
this so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything in one place</font>

1910
01:27:00,659 --> 01:27:07,030
yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave is shaking his head the benefit</font>

1911
01:27:05,289 --> 01:27:12,938
is ultimately getting to one document

1912
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:14,259
rather than having to Lou burger I was

1913
01:27:12,939 --> 01:27:15,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically gonna say the same thing why</font>

1914
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:18,209
is that a goal let's make this working

1915
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:21,159
group document do a passive review a

1916
01:27:18,209 --> 01:27:23,169
round of review on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and then last call</font>

1917
01:27:21,159 --> 01:27:26,169
it it was just leaked make it a working

1918
01:27:23,169 --> 01:27:27,610
with document yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> next yeah I I want to</font>

1919
01:27:26,169 --> 01:27:30,909
shoot my preference to I want this to be

1920
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:33,098
like a separate document and and get it

1921
01:27:30,909 --> 01:27:36,339
out and sent off like so just as an

1922
01:27:33,099 --> 01:27:38,919
author so let's try this so um let's

1923
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:41,079
hump for the adoption of this document

1924
01:27:38,919 --> 01:27:42,849
that's working group document how many

1925
01:27:41,079 --> 01:27:45,039
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this document should</font>

1926
01:27:42,849 --> 01:27:49,719
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> working the group document at this</font>

1927
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:53,860
point mm-hmm how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think it</font>

1928
01:27:49,719 --> 01:27:55,539
should not I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that gives us some</font>

1929
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:58,169
guidance<font color="#E5E5E5"> headed for this point at least</font>

1930
01:27:55,539 --> 01:28:01,719
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a group document and</font>

1931
01:27:58,169 --> 01:28:03,939
I know of course we have to confirm this

1932
01:28:01,719 --> 01:28:05,469
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> memories thank you Bob like</font>

1933
01:28:03,939 --> 01:28:07,300
everything has to be confirmed<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

1934
01:28:05,469 --> 01:28:10,959
mailing list that is let's put that

1935
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:12,459
disclaimer s in general<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>
