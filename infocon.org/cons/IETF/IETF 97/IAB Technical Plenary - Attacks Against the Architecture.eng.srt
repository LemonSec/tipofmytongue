00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:13,010
good afternoon everybody evening um and

2
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:13,719
we are here for it's a tough act to

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,720
follow

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,820
particularly but we're here for the IAB

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,500
technical plotting and we're here to

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a new class of attacks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,600

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,040
some insights we hope our new it's

there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an immediate sense that there</font>

28
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,280
afterwards there should be things to

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,570
learn as a DNS person myself for

00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">instance I spent a lot of time in those</font>

31
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,919
first few days answering a lot of

32
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:20,920
questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the DNS worked how</font>

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,370
the internet works and trying to correct

34
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,190
some of the more to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the more</font>

35
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,360
alarming things that people were saying

36
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,500
but pretty quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was obvious that</font>

37
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,929
there were things to learn here that

38
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:35,260
went beyond one large providers no good

39
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:37,450
very bad day or the challenges in

40
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,550
providing one particular service to the

41
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,940

<font color="#E5E5E5">part of the internet architecture itself</font>

43
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:48,460
so we asked Nick Sullivan here to Nick

44
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,979
Sullivan to come and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk with us from</font>

00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">cloudflare we also asked our own Andrew</font>

Sullivan to speak to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the subject both</font>

because and in spite of him being an

employee of dying the provider who was

49
00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:02,710
attacked and an IV member so he's here

50
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,539
in both capacities but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're hoping both</font>

51
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,548
of them will provide some insight some

perspective on masculine or net attacks

53
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:11,439
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> primarily we think there's some</font>

underlying and<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerning observations</font>

55
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,390
to make here and would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see some</font>

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,430
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> implications of</font>

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,659
perhaps new insight on vulnerabilities

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,019
of the architecture of the Internet

59

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay hello everybody thank you for</font>

having me I'm Nick Sullivan from cloud

62
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:43,490
player I'm going to kind of go over some

63
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:46,080
lessons that we've learned in terms of

64
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:49,110
this is coming on sun in terms of

65
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,320
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with large attacks and really</font>

66
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:56,720
staying online so the talks called how

67
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:59,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">to stay online and it's it's starts with</font>

68
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,660
starts with a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a dark tone</font>

69
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:06,270
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> d dos it exists and it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

70
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,820
part of all of our futures and running

71
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:12,720
infrastructure is difficult especially

72
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:16,980
in a hostile environment and I think the

73
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,390
main<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason that I'm here is is can be</font>

74
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,940

78
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:34,560
particularly new botnets exist they've

79
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:38,930
existed for a long time this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

80
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:42,600
example of botnets at a larger scale and

81
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:44,340
they send a mix of attacks so when you

82
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about DDoS or when you talk to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">someone about D dust</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is really what</font>

84
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:52,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">you think about generally is this sort</font>

00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:55,410
of reflection amplification attack using

86
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:58,110
some amount of compromised machines and

87
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,810
reflecting off of a protocol that does

not valid valid a source address perhaps

89
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:08,760
using UDP ntp and DNS or two of these

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:11,910
examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this this still goes on but</font>

it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the majority of the type</font>

00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:28,260
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> into three main categories some of</font>

99
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:36,270
they shouldn't be new to anyone but I'm

100
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:39,900
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to describe ways that when you see</font>

I don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain to anyone in</font>

105
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,150
this room how DNS works but when it

106
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,210
comes to attacks on DNS there are two

107
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:59,159
main<font color="#E5E5E5"> types first is direct attacks on</font>

108
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:02,758
the authoritative dns server from a

109
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:07,050
botnet second<font color="#E5E5E5"> are attacks that go</font>

110
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,879
through valid recursos and are laundered

111
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,590
by these recursive before they move to

112
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,759
authority of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns the first set are</font>

113
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:20,429
typically larger volumes than the second

114
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:24,120
direct authoritative the question is if

115
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:26,099
you're faced with a flood of requests at

116
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,889
your authoritative<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not</font>

117
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:31,169
from resolvers that you know then you

118
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:34,340
should be very suspicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

119
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:38,099
architecture is built to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go from the</font>

120
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:40,948
endpoint stub resolvers to be recursive

121
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:44,219
resolvers to the authoritative<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns and</font>

122
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:46,379
if you see a lot of packets and a lot of

123
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:49,319
requests you should probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> just drop</font>

124
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,759
them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is potentially safe and</font>

125
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,729
this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only way to stay</font>

126
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,770
online for direct to authoritative

127
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:58,740
attacks so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are these floods look</font>

128
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:01,080
like typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are requests for</font>

129
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,529
your apex domain your dub dub dub domain

130
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:07,318
or random subdomains of these two and

131
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:10,080
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they go after random</font>

132
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:13,469
subdomains is that it costs more for you

133
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,109
to look it up as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns server sometimes</font>

134
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:19,050
they come with spoofed addresses source

135
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,270
addresses sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in them in the</font>

136
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:24,240
case of the Mariah botnets they're

137
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:26,099
oftentimes not spoofed addresses which

138
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:32,400
makes them slightly easier to deal with

139
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:36,509
but not by that much dns flood survival

140
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,789
kit so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is one idea this is</font>

141
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:41,339
one one thing that used to be done quite

142
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:44,460
a lot for actually protecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> aids these</font>

143
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:47,099
type of large attacks and that's no no

144
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,930
routing ip's you take the IP that's

145
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:51,509
under attack and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertise it</font>

146
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,449

<font color="#CCCCCC">the internet this is a pretty dangerous</font>

148
00:06:54,449 --> 00:07:00,120
thing to do and it has lots of

149
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:02,520
cushions lately attackers have been

150
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,159
flooding entire subnets making this very

151
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:10,318
unreasonable in terms of of a defense

152
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:12,750
mechanism furthermore these glue records

153

that you use to point to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

154
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:18,030

156
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,780
feasible at the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is not</font>

157
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:26,550
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would recommend at the</font>

158
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:30,359
current point but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two main</font>

159
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:32,039
techniques to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself up if you're</font>

160
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,990
running this sort of authoritative DNS

161
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,789
infrastructure the first is spreading

162
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,250
the load and then the second is

163
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:40,889
filtering filter fast and filter often

164
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:44,699
one way to spread the load is to run any

165
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:47,430
cast network this allows you to spread

166
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:50,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">the load geographically network hardware</font>

167
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,319
does not scale linearly in price if you

168
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,448
have a 10 gig piece of hardware that

169
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not going to cost ten times more to</font>

170
00:07:54,449 --> 00:08:00,449
buy a hundred gig version it's it's

00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:02,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">really horizontally if you can make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

your data centers is low it's cheaper

174
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:10,409
it's easier to handle spreading the load

175
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,479
not only geographically but within the

176
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:17,909
data center ecmp is a good way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

177
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:21,029
this filtering packets going down from

<font color="#E5E5E5">the top of the rack to the actual DNS</font>

application filters as early and as soon

180

as you can there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

181
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,729
mechanisms you can use at different

levels that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can handle different amounts</font>

183
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:35,880
of packets if you're if the request gets

to your DNS application you might as

187
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,130

188
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:47,160
only legitimate packets get to your

189
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:51,029
application there are a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font>

190
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:55,110
of doing this one is iptables BPF rules

191
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:57,000
these are very powerful techniques that

192
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,880
you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> to match and block packets</font>

193
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,390
inside the kernel and these can be

194
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,910
automated which is very important there

195
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:09,630
are tools open source tools to create

196
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:11,040
BPF rules that match attax but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

197
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,880
not something that works with a static

198
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,469
configuration

199
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:18,540
you really have to move fast and and

200
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,310
change them at very often because if you

201
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:24,030
have too many rules it can cause

202
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:27,660
problems in in other situations so

203
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:29,850
heuristics<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine learning attacks</font>

204

into the network interface card this can

really help relieve the load DNS floods

<font color="#E5E5E5">helpful and the right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to do</font>

236
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:55,080
because if you rate limit this can cause

237
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:58,199
some negative effects including an

238
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,000
amplification of of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> request as the</font>

that it may end up getting better one

304
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:12,160
one key thing is for if there is there

305
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,900
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a viral aspect to this so if you have</font>

308
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:22,480

the economics margins are very thin so

313
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,670
things like a secure by default open

327
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,810
another piece is attribution if you know

00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:23,079
where the attacks are coming from

329
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:25,420
currently source IP is something that

00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:28,480
can be spoofed<font color="#E5E5E5"> net flow is something</font>

342
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:02,199
that the Internet has choke points and

343
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:05,290
as attacker bandwidth grows they can

344
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,690
target these chokepoints and things like

345
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:10,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">anycast things like being able to stop</font>

346
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:12,610
the attack as close or to stop bad

347

traffic as close as possible to the edge

these<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks is is very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> valuable for</font>

350
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:23,560
actually protecting these chokepoints

351
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:28,240
anycast is just one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these techniques</font>

352
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:32,410
that allows you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that if you're</font>

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:35,980
subject to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to an attack keeping your</font>

354
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:38,260
costs down are very important and this

355
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:42,370
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only way to really sustain a</font>

356
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:44,650
large scale enterprises is to not have

357
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:47,590
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for these these</font>

358
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:51,550
very large attacks luckily many<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

359
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:54,340
protocols are asymmetrical and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have</font>

360
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:58,329
great caching semantics broadcast HTTP

361
00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:00,250
for example so you have extra extra

362
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,960
capacity on ingress if you're mixed if

363
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,079
you're using multiple protocols in the

364
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,790
same data center scrubbing centers

365
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,399
sometimes these can be very<font color="#CCCCCC"> expensive</font>

366
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:12,280
because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> single-use and you pay</font>

367
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:16,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the maximum</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the bandwidth so it's</font>

368
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:19,990
it's it's good to spread things out keep

369
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:25,690
things spread out and distribute the

370
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:30,070
load and filter early and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

371
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:32,010
of a sunny final end to this but I wish

372
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:37,570
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't this way but staying online</font>

373
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:40,450
now requires scale so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

374
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,980
something where you have to be big<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

375
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:46,180
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be smart and you have to have</font>

376
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:48,670
tools and you have to work together with

377
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:52,810
other people to try to stop the attacks

378
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:54,580
close as possible to the edge and the

379
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:56,520
techniques I described here try to

380
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,199
approximate this as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as possible</font>

381
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,780
it's it is possible to survive these

382
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:06,040
large attacks and it is possible to

383
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,190
survive in an internet ecosystem and

384
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,740
with

385
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:13,720
attackers have exceedingly large

386
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:15,970
bandwidth but this this involves really

387
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,909
paying attention and doing things right

388
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:21,309
on multiple levels all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

389
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:24,309
your stack and thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about your</font>

390
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:29,049
architecture and building things so that

391
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:34,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">they can handle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's the end of</font>

my<font color="#CCCCCC"> sunny presentation thank you</font>

393
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,080
and we'll find the other I was thinking

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">of Nick's thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very much neck and I</font>

395

was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this as sort of the the</font>

396
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:58,379
setting of the big picture and I guess

397
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,130
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have Andrew drawing some details</font>

398
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:05,180
and some finer points and then we'll

399
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">have your questions and comments</font>

if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put a clock here than I won't just</font>

401
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:29,020
talk forever so I'm Andrew for those of

402
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:31,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">you who know me as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the chair of the IAB</font>

403
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:35,170
I also work for this company called Dyne

404
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:36,820
it's called Dyne not din<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is dynamic</font>

405
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:41,740
rather than the noise that you heard

406
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:45,000
when everything broke<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah we had a bad</font>

407
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,000
day recently<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

408
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:00,160
and I think take two they're small I

409
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:15,560
have the wrong version there are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

410
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:21,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">them up there this looks just like what</font>

411
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:25,220
I put up no that one's mine that one's

412
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:31,610
his he's also mr. Sullivan there's no

413
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:33,440
relation um so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the</font>

414
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,120
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with naming you see that you</font>

415
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,620
need you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique names we should</font>

416
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,439
have had a hierarchical system and then

417
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,000
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have worked up so so I</font>

418
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,890
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit about about</font>

419
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,240
what happened during this bad day and

420
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">then I also want to talk a little bit</font>

421
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,830
about what it means for the internet

422
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,750
architecture on and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

423
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,159
couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that that i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

424
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,220
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean the first thing is that</font>

425
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:59,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was a large number of devices but</font>

426
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:02,660
but the the attack is really against

427
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:06,170
some desirable attributes of of the

428
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:08,420
network and i think that this this kind

429
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:10,250
of or this style of attack actually

430
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,660
could attack a bunch of regulation or it

431
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,700
could attract rather a bunch of

432
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,260
regulations towards us if we're not

433
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,150
careful about it and so what I would

434
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:18,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to argue today is that we should</font>

435
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:22,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually do something about this</font>

436
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:25,100
ourselves so what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well on</font>

437
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:27,020
these were attacks against some dine in

438
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,060
infrastructure and it was noticed

439
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:31,340
because on there were some systems that

440
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,889
depended upon us you know customers on

441
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,540
and and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what happens you know</font>

442
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:38,270
you get one of these things nobody knew

443
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:40,490
about us at all before<font color="#E5E5E5"> before this event</font>

444
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:42,800
and our marketing people are really of

445
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:45,590
two minds about this whole thing right

446
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,450
um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> however didn't want to know now I</font>

447
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:49,070
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to emphasize that I didn't do any</font>

448
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,720
direct work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this because I've been an</font>

449
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:53,870
internet politician for the past two

450
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">years and so on I have you know I'm now</font>

451
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:58,179
useless to my employer and what this

452
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">meant was that our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NOC and the</font>

453
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,180
operations<font color="#E5E5E5"> people did all the work and</font>

454
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,650
like you know knocks and operations

455
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,480
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do whenever there's a crisis they</font>

456
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,850
did a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great job so I want to thank them</font>

457
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,130
and also a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dine</font>

458
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:11,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chris Baker and Phil Stanhope in</font>

459
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,550
particular fed me some of these things

460
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,929
so they fed me this stuff but of course

461
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,570
the conclusions are mine<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all the</font>

462
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:20,270
mistakes are mine in any case this led

463
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:22,310
me to some questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about about the DNS</font>

464
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:25,540
infrastructure now our infrastructure is

465
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:27,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">an any caste based system that is mostly</font>

466
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:30,500
transit driven there are reasons for

467
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:32,600
that but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> primary thing is that we we</font>

468
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,340
did this because we had a system that

469
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,350
allowed us to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain kinds of</font>

470
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,899
management to avoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly this kind of</font>

471
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:40,490
problem so it didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work out in this</font>

472
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:43,370
case but in the past it's worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

473
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:46,850
well for us and the on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of</font>

474
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:48,979
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to get this this system which is</font>

475
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:51,379
fairly large it's it's it's in 18 sites

476
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,090
and and the the diversity of this thing

477
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,500
was arranged in such a way that you

478
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:57,949
didn't tend to have on this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

479
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:02,330
problem so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened on on the 21st</font>

480
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:04,430
of October about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1110 UTC we had a thing</font>

481
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,960
start up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and was like the normal normal</font>

482
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:08,420
D das and he's happen all the time it

483
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,850
was targeted me you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> across our</font>

484
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,410
systems and the NOC started doing the

485
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:14,840
usual run books that they always<font color="#E5E5E5"> do for</font>

486
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:17,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">this kind of thing and then suddenly the</font>

487
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,399
whole thing changed and it moved<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font>

488
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:21,020
u.s. East region you know we're doing

489
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dns tricks that everybody else</font>

490
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:26,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this area</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we've got these</font>

491
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:28,460
regions and what happened was there were

492
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,780
way more addresses than normal but also

493
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,920
the attack pattern was a little

494
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">different than normal i'm going to talk</font>

495
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,300
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in a minute so this caused</font>

496
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:37,070
some resolution failures that is things

497
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,080
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't get answered and also it</font>

498
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:40,760
caused some long latency on things which

499
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,620
those of you who are familiar with the

500
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">dns you know that if the latency is long</font>

501
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,340
enough it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the thing isn't</font>

502
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:50,690
there because you just ignore it this

503
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:52,879
lasted until about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 13 20 UTC and then we</font>

504
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:55,010
had another one so this you know we put

505
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,140
in some mitigations and the mitigations

506
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,090
worked and

507
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:00,160
the the attack stopped and they were

508
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:01,780
mopping up the way knock always does and

509
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,730
of course while they were mopping up

510
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:05,770
another attack started<font color="#E5E5E5"> only this</font>

511
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:08,980
targeted all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers in the world</font>

512
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:10,629
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had so we knew a little bit</font>

513
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,400
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing had worked and but</font>

514
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:14,590
of course we hadn't actually made the

515
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,380
changes globally so naturally<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

516
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:19,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">still widely observable this we</font>

517
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">recovered by about 1700 UTC but there</font>

518
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:24,399
was some sort of hangover that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we still</font>

519
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,360
haven't completely figured out what what

520
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,830
happened there but there were some

521
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,870
resolvers that weren't able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach us</font>

522
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:31,419
and they were not small obscure

523
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:36,429
resolvers one of them is<font color="#CCCCCC"> operated by a</font>

524
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:38,770
company that used to start with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> G so</font>

525
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:40,630
what was unusual about this was actually

526
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,370
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we've seen lots and lots</font>

527
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:44,530
of sort of standard amplification

528
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:46,780
attacks but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular attack had a</font>

529
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:48,610
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really high proportion of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp and</font>

530
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> normally see that in these</font>

531
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:52,000
kinds of attacks because normally it

532
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,500
involves a lot of state on the attacker

533
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,140
side as well so they don't do it and

534
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,550
there's very little spoofing on in this

535
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:00,820
or I shouldn't say very little but

536
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:03,430
comparatively low spoofing we have

537
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:05,770
definitely confirmed 40,000 addresses

538
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:07,150
involved in this botnet but maybe

539
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,440
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a hundred thousand</font>

540
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,820
addresses in the botnet now you're

541
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,280
probably saying to yourself gee that's

542
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:14,889
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buck net on but think a</font>

543
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,149
little bit about DNS and TCP and what

544
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,160
happens when you've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font>

545
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:21,370
thousand members of your botnet and

546
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:23,230
they're all opening say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten TCP</font>

547
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:26,620
connections to your DNS servers and you

548
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:28,810
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how this thing can can expand</font>

549
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">fairly quickly the other thing about</font>

550
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">this was of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course as we started to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

551
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:34,409
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've never had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this problem</font>

552
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:36,729
before but on the recovery

553
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:38,620
retransmissions by some of the resolvers

554
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:40,330
actually served as a sort of second

555
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,129
front so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got this sort of second wave</font>

556
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:44,800
amplification which caused us some

557
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:46,600
problems we<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely had a mere I bet</font>

558
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">on baseball net we've done done a bunch</font>

559
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,399
of forensics on this we've identified

560
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:55,090
pretty much where these things were and

561
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:57,160
and not who was behind it and we still

562
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:59,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">as I said don't exactly understand what</font>

563
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,540
this hangover was but it did cause a

564
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">sustained outage even though everything</font>

565
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:06,520
was up and and we haven't completely

566
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:08,980
explained that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to emphasize that</font>

567
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:13,418
I do not believe this is a one-off on

568
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:14,799
uh the there was a previous attack just

569
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:18,340
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a couple of weeks before this</font>

570
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:21,280
that was you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> very very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> large we saw</font>

571
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:23,830
we know that the mere i bought nut code

572
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,290
is out there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's is being</font>

573
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:27,879
improved upon by by various people but

574
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:30,100
it's not the only botnet code that's out

575
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:34,330
there either right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure you all have</font>

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite um ddos example so what</font>

showed up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the press was Internet of</font>

578
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,418
Things takes down these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and</font>

579
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,600
that's what the problem is Internet of

580
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:45,010
Things is bad and evil right on so it's

581
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,659
a mirror I botnet and<font color="#CCCCCC"> those of you who</font>

582
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:48,070
aren't familiar with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's using</font>

583
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,500
these Internet of Things devices that

584
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:52,210
are easily compromised and there was an

585
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,309
Internet of Things dimension to this

586
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,679
attack but I really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to emphasize I</font>

587
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:58,330
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's the main story</font>

588
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,429
because this attack pattern uses the

589
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:02,770
very thing that makes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

590
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:06,700
strong and it's using it to attack the

591
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:09,340
way the internet works I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

592
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,530
is an irony<font color="#E5E5E5"> right what we've got here is</font>

593
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:14,230
an attack of irony against the internet

594
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:16,450
it's it's astonishing to me so back in

595
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:18,010
the easy time what would happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

596
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:20,799
attackers would you know by a bunch of

597
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:22,360
things in some provider they would you

598
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,918
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and check in kato or something</font>

599
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,299
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that spoofing</font>

600
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,530
was allowed from there and then they

601
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:27,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">would set up their botnet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and they'd</font>

602
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:30,399
have their botnet army and they'd send

603
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:32,260
you a lot of stuff and this was a you

604
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">know typically UDP and there was a lot</font>

605
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:36,790
of spoofing and so on these were cheap

606
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:38,080
and effective but what happened of

607
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,850
course is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people got better at</font>

608
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,559
scrubbing and they got better at soaking

609
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:44,889
these things up because you know you

610
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:46,120
just you just you just outrun them and

611
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,799
it turned out not to be that<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard you</font>

612
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the cost of transits going down</font>

613
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:51,370
cost of processing is going down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

614
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:53,500
people said ah well we'll just win this

615
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:55,178
thing forever I remember actually being

616
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,590
mocked a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago when I said</font>

617
00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:58,600
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna run out of money</font>

618
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:00,340
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> they run out of compromise host</font>

619
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:04,480
and everybody said now will will will

620
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:06,250
beat them well I'm afraid we're here so

621
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,290
the first answer to all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is to</font>

622
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:09,730
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> really big right this has been this</font>

623
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:11,620
has been the answer what you're going to

624
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,690
do is you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have like you know</font>

625
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,070
lots and lots of any<font color="#CCCCCC"> caste you can have</font>

626
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">CDNs all over the place and everything</font>

627
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,490
like that and what I'm worried about

628
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:20,169
here is that what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're building is no</font>

629
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:22,179
longer an<font color="#E5E5E5"> intranet but in all the Garko</font>

630
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:24,340
net that you can't

631
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:27,610
actually participate in running services

632
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,720
online unless you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get really huge on or</font>

633
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:30,039
at least you know large enough that

634
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,869
you're spending<font color="#E5E5E5"> a significant amount of</font>

635
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:33,610
money on your infrastructure that

636
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:36,249
doesn't seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me to be the internet</font>

637
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:37,269
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to build and it</font>

638
00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:38,769
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's the thing that</font>

639
00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:40,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've built</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think we better ask</font>

640
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:42,059
ourselves whether we should be so<font color="#CCCCCC"> proud</font>

641
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,678
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we've got here</font>

642
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:47,619
there are problems with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it creates</font>

643
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:50,379
monoculture it creates the<font color="#E5E5E5"> associated</font>

644
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:52,059
security problems it also means of

645
00:28:50,379 --> 00:28:53,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">course that the distributed nature of</font>

646
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:55,269
the internet that we keep talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

647
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:57,190
is no longer true because you've got

648
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:59,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">these giant providers who are involved</font>

649
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,879
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything and it makes for high</font>

650
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:03,269
barriers to entry and I don't think that

651
00:29:00,879 --> 00:29:05,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a great a great arrangement</font>

652
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:07,629
nevertheless I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obvious that</font>

653
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,220
the Internet of Things is going to

654
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:11,259
create continue to create these kinds of

655
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:14,019
problems it encourages this<font color="#E5E5E5"> ubiquitous</font>

656
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:15,850
connectivity and even very very

657
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:18,070
lightweight systems things that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

658
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:20,289
very powerful on you know have enough

659
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,789
power to open<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few TCP connections and</font>

660
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:22,960
and so on and you know what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to</font>

661
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:24,220
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the budget right like a</font>

662
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,809
billion here a billion they are pretty

663
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,700
soon you're talking real money well the

664
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:29,619
same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is true here if you've got</font>

665
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,090
you know millions and millions of these

666
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:33,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices all over the place you're going</font>

667
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:35,678
to have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of compromise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about hosts</font>

668
00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:37,539
and and they make they make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

669
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,519
available the other thing of course I

670
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:41,110
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this people</font>

671
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet of Things here</font>

672
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,258
but it isn't only that right a lot of

673
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:46,749
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices that we're talking about</font>

674
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:48,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">aren't really Internet of Things devices</font>

675
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:50,139
so much as there are just consumer

676
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:52,090
devices and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their intended to connect to</font>

677
00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:53,229
anything at all so they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a hub</font>

678
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,759
they don't have a home that they call

679
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,409
back to or<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything like that they just</font>

680
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:59,649
connect to anything they can and<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

681
00:29:56,409 --> 00:30:01,570
things are compromised about as well now

682
00:29:59,649 --> 00:30:03,518
the vulnerabilities are pretty bad one

683
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:05,408
of my colleagues did some did some work

684
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,570
on this and discovered<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean we had</font>

685
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:09,070
like 4.1 million unique a records

686
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,320
hanging<font color="#E5E5E5"> around so he did he did some</font>

687
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:13,330
poking at it he found ten percent of the

688
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,129
devices in the sample were affected now

689
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:16,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">three hundred devices doesn't maybe seem</font>

690
00:30:15,129 --> 00:30:19,240
like very much but<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this was</font>

691
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,639
only 4.1 million IP addresses which also

692
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,470
isn't very much um the other thing

693
00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:24,998
though that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he noticed and he put this</font>

694
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:27,369
on a slide that he presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> some where</font>

695
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:30,100
was this use case encourages owners to

696
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:32,769
open them to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet this really</font>

697
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:35,919
bothered me because it seemed to me that

698
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:37,540
the whole point of this was to connect

699
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,420
everything to the internet that's why

700
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:42,490
we're here and so if our answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font>

701
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,990
is well we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to discourage</font>

702
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:45,250
people from connecting things to the

703
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:47,290
internet in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent the</font>

704
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:48,550
security from getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of control on</font>

705
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:52,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet then we have failed</font>

706
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:54,790
completely so remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have this</font>

707
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,650
dumb network that we wanted to build we

708
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,420
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to maximize the intelligence at</font>

709
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,560
the edge you could still have a dumb

710
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,940
device or whatever you know these

711
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,379
Internet of Things devices aren't that

712
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,910
smart but they're still supposed to be

713
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,710
smarter really than the network they're

714
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:08,290
not the net the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network's not supposed</font>

715
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,910
to be making<font color="#CCCCCC"> the decisions this is all</font>

716
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:12,100
you know it's got all the usual good

717
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,450
stories you know the permission list

718
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,240

719
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:18,370
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on the problem is that this</font>

720
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">is what makes for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attack that we're</font>

721
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:24,939
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a really bad story</font>

722
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:27,040
when those end devices um can attack you

723
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,560
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just compromise about</font>

724
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,970
things right<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you could you</font>

725
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">could do this by leaving a lot of</font>

726
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:34,540
devices in coffee shops all over the

727
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:35,950
place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're all perfectly secured</font>

728
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:39,280
because they're controlled by the bad

729
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:41,500
guys um that'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be that'd be another way</font>

730
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,870
to run this attack you could do this by

731
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,820
compromising a whole bunch of you know

732
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:47,649
machines<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have not been updated in a</font>

733
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,060
long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they've all got ubiquitous</font>

734
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,620
connectivity that's another way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

735
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:53,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">this there's lots and lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways to do</font>

736
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:55,360
this the<font color="#CCCCCC"> insecurity of devices is not</font>

737
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,909
the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not DNS or UDP</font>

738
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,340
specific so things like bcp 38 don't

739
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:03,370
solve solve it and if you add more

740
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:05,500
providers it doesn't automatically solve

741
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:07,510
the problem it just causes more barriers

742
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,370
to entry because<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens is you're</font>

743
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:11,680
in an arms race and you're in an arms

744
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:16,229
race against people who have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> infinite</font>

745
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:19,780
supply of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosts so they can throw at you</font>

746
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:21,580
I've heard people already making actual

747
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,870
proposals<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this so the first one of</font>

748
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:25,149
course people said well the government

749
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:27,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">should mandate bcp 38 which wouldn't</font>

750
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:29,320
even have worked in this case so<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so</font>

751
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very interesting thing</font>

752
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,429
there are people who want to give

753
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:36,580
licenses for connections either to

754
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:38,410
devices or to humans uh that that'd be a

755
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,830
fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll get a global</font>

worldwide internet license police um

757
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:45,010
I've definitely heard people talking

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">about and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is coming folks</font>

759
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:49,180
so be ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it I believe that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

760
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:51,990
are going to implement

764
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:01,060

talk to thrum through some recursive if

766
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:04,690
you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that we have a problem in</font>

00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too and now we have changed you know</font>

770
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,130
the nature of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet quite a lot</font>

771
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,290
there are lots and lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

772
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:15,940
we could do in order to reduce the

00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:20,320
openness of the Internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order to</font>

774
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:22,840
solve this problem now<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty years ago</font>

775
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was a big change to the automotive</font>

776
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,860
industry prior to the publication of

777
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:29,110
this book by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ralph Nader unsafe at any</font>

778
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:31,870
speed I mean this book is mostly famous

779
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:33,699
for destroying the Corvair right corvair

780
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:35,229
was a car in<font color="#E5E5E5"> North America</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and was it</font>

781
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,110
destroyed that but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more</font>

782
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:40,420
important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this book did was</font>

783
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:43,600
change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nature of the automotive</font>

784
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:45,580
industry in North America from an almost

785
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,870
completely unregulated system where

786
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,490
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> could build stuff and they just</font>

787
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:51,100
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> put them on the roads and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

788
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:54,100
big deal into a very heavily regulated

789
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,689
industry and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people even automotive</font>

790
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,909
industry people so I got a quote from

791
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:59,950
him right Bob Lutz who was a big

792
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:01,810
automotive industry person he has now

793
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:04,330
come to believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this book had a</font>

794
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:05,710
seminal effect because it made sure that

795
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:08,230
there was definitely a role for

796
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,990
government in automotive safety Bob Lutz

797
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:12,190
who opposed every single one of the

798
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:15,850
regulations that came from this<font color="#E5E5E5"> he still</font>

799
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:18,790
thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea transformative</font>

800
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:21,429
technologies like the automotive

801
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:24,009
automobile and like the internet attract

802
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:25,629
attention from cultures and the culture

803
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:27,190
if it's transformative enough the track

804
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,930
the culture says<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're going to let</font>

805
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:31,450
you in we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make our our lives</font>

806
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:33,669
around you but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're going to do is</font>

807
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:34,929
we're going to extract rules about about

808
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,639
what you're going to do from that we're

809
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:38,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to start imposing rules on you and</font>

810
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,190
I think that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

811
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:45,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">point we're facing it now I think there</font>

812
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,330
are things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could do ourselves</font>

813
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:50,290
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the problems with with regulating</font>

814
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:52,150
the internet is that the structure is

815
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:54,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">not like the automotive world right so</font>

816
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:56,710
so the car world the thing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

817
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:59,109
the cars are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a place and the and the</font>

818
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:00,640
roads were mostly publicly owned but

819
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:02,890
neither<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those things is true on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

820
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,259
internet the the infrastructure is<font color="#CCCCCC"> mo</font>

821
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:07,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">firstly privately owned and of course</font>

822
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:09,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way that the structure works the</font>

network of networks of networks and so

824
00:35:09,069 --> 00:35:12,819
on means it is very hard to know exactly

825
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:16,000
whose behavior it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to you</font>

826
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:17,859
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change on so there are things</font>

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">however that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we could do there are built</font>

828
00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:22,630
on this on this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of system we could</font>

829
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,849
ask ourselves whether devices or

830
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:26,559
applications or whatever could advertise

831
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:30,849
the kinds of traffic they want to send

832
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:33,970
or whatever we could we could try to get

833
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:35,440
applications to you know work in some

834
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,939
kind of scope so that you know whether

835
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,579
you're supposed to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> inside this</font>

836
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:41,440
network or not and these are you know

837
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:42,819
general on questions that I have I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

838
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,069
know what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I noticed that</font>

839
00:35:42,819 --> 00:35:46,990
home that on which you know met today

840
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:48,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">but is working around these kinds of</font>

841
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:50,890
things right what we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tackle</font>

842
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:52,150
there basically is what you do for

843
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:54,009
people who have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> network that is</font>

844
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,240
effectively completely unmanaged but it

845
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:58,329
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be like really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> super</font>

846
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,979
sophisticated it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are</font>

847
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:02,859
various kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback mechanisms</font>

848
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:04,839
that we want I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will note that you know</font>

849
00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:06,759
for instance source quench doesn't work

850
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:08,710
anymore but maybe you need something

851
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,119
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I don't know what the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

852
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,799
answer is I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not proposing that we</font>

853
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:13,559
revive source quench so please don't get

854
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:16,390
up to the microphone and tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that on</font>

855
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:19,059
I guess the general thing that I want to

856
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:21,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">point out however is twofold first of</font>

857
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:23,710
all we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be very careful here</font>

858
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:25,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's really easy to propose</font>

859
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:27,430
simple solutions that actually just

860
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,019
invite a new kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attack so we move</font>

861
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:30,819
the problem around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've already</font>

862
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:33,279
heard people complaining about DNS SEC

863
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:35,230
um in this way right DNS SEC solved the

864
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:37,599
problem with spoofing and it solved that

865
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:40,690
by making the DNS and an excellent

866
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,279
amplifier and so maybe this is you know

867
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:43,930
something to think about the second

868
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:45,730
thing is I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do not</font>

869
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:47,410
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and answer these questions</font>

870
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,329
ourselves somebody else is going to

871
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">answer those questions for us and it's</font>

872
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:52,690
not going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> answered in rooms that</font>

873
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:57,819
look like this no t-shirts are going to

874
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:59,349
be involved um so not all<font color="#E5E5E5"> regulation is</font>

875
00:36:57,819 --> 00:37:01,509
automatically bad and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

876
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:02,920
emphasize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I the fact of the</font>

877
00:37:01,509 --> 00:37:06,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">matter is that the automotive industry</font>

878
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,809
was not putting seat belts in cars and

879
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,009
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of evidence to suggest that</font>

880
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:11,109
wearing your<font color="#E5E5E5"> seat belt during a</font>

881
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:13,000
collision makes it less<font color="#CCCCCC"> likely that</font>

882
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:14,348
you're going to die and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seemed like</font>

883
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
the sort of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that like would just</font>

884
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:16,539
be obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we'll put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seatbelts</font>

885
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">in all the car</font>

886
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:20,529
but but the automotive industry wouldn't

887
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:22,929
do it that was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ralph</font>

888
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:25,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nader's complaint was that the industry</font>

889
00:37:22,929 --> 00:37:27,009
was more interested in you know its own

890
00:37:25,569 --> 00:37:28,509
profits than it was interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

891
00:37:27,009 --> 00:37:31,599
spending a few hundred dollars a year

892
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:34,569
per car on improving safety order

893
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,160
ability or efficiency or you know the

894
00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:38,319
pollution state or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that</font>

895
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:42,399
and so what happened is that the

896
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:43,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">regulator stepped in and did it the</font>

897
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,089
problem with this kind of regulatory

898
00:37:43,749 --> 00:37:49,390
environment is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it causes long lead</font>

899
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:51,189
times and it creates perverse incentives

900
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:53,109
one of the interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things about the</font>

901
00:37:51,189 --> 00:37:54,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">North American automotive market is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

902
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:56,679
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rules were different for cars</font>

903
00:37:54,819 --> 00:37:58,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">and trucks so what we saw was this</font>

904
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:01,959
explosion in light truck on the traffic

905
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:03,369
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US and Canadian roads and the</font>

906
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:05,019
reason for that was that the incentives

907
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:06,189
were set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that the automotive</font>

908
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:08,198
industry had a reason to push those

909
00:38:06,189 --> 00:38:10,629
things so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful about</font>

910
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:12,279
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I say we</font>

911
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:14,499
are the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who ought to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tackle this</font>

912
00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:16,569
problem we have to tackle<font color="#E5E5E5"> this problem</font>

913
00:38:14,499 --> 00:38:18,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we understand the technology we</font>

914
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:21,130
understand what the what the incentives

915
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:22,808
are and we understand the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nature of</font>

916
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,339
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> underlying thing and if we don't do</font>

917
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:26,019
it ourselves and we don't tackle some of

918
00:38:24,339 --> 00:38:29,109
these perverse incentives somebody's

919
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:31,808
going to come along and do it for us so

920
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:33,609
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> magic solution for you I</font>

921
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,959
wish I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did but I hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this has been</font>

922
00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:37,089
a little bit of food for thought and I

923
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:39,428
hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

924
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:41,229
useful discussion here in the IETF

925
00:38:39,429 --> 00:38:42,729
plenary all of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are smarter than I am</font>

926
00:38:41,229 --> 00:38:43,538
so the chances are good that you're

927
00:38:42,729 --> 00:38:45,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to come up with</font>

928
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:48,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">something better than I would anyway</font>

929
00:38:45,249 --> 00:38:48,419
thanks very much

930
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:00,990
Wow so um well<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody is thinking</font>

931
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,640
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

932
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:04,560
questions i'm going to put yaariyan the

933
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,660
spot I need a time check because I

934
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:18,299
forgot to ask how long do you think we

935
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:21,960
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I guess your first set or</font>

936
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:26,190
Michael or call upon question to you

937
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:29,060
Andrew what you just described with with

938
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:31,290
the car example was Nader pointing to

939
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:34,320
existing solutions that were not

940
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:38,310
implemented by the market the<font color="#CCCCCC"> seatbelt</font>

941
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:40,110
was already available as i leave i think

942
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:43,049
that we are in a different situation

943
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:50,970
here we don't seem to have the

944
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:53,040
fundamental solutions does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work it</font>

945
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:55,080
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it just doesn't have a little</font>

946
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">light so i don't have an indicator so</font>

947
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,920
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> true that the seatbelt was</font>

948
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:01,110
something that that already existed but

949
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,210
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> um Nader's book is really</font>

950
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:04,710
instructive I I like the automotive

951
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,060
example just because it's so

952
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:08,580
transformative but you can find this in

953
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:10,230
other kinds of industries actually

954
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nader's complaint was not just that they</font>

955
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:13,170
wouldn't implement stuff that was known

956
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:16,110
already but they wouldn't do any

957
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:18,540
research on on alternatives either so

958
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:20,310
they weren't they weren't working on on

959
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,410
other kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff they weren't trying</font>

960
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:24,540
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find new things they weren't trying</font>

961
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:27,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make the car more fuel-efficient or</font>

962
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:29,490
or safer or anything like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

963
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:32,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that both of those kinds of things</font>

964
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:33,629
are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important both for our</font>

965
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,070
industry and for other industries but i

966
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:43,490
think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we're the ones who can</font>

967
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:46,560
talk about this one front stage left

968
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:48,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kathleen Moriarty second d so Andrew I</font>

969
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:52,529
wish you were I hope you're right that

970
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:54,930
this is a turning point but evidence

971
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:58,710
looking out at interest in system

972
00:40:54,930 --> 00:41:01,470
hygiene it's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for IOT it's not</font>

973
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:03,780
there for open source you know if you

974
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:06,160
talk to leaders of open source efforts

975
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:08,620
they're literally saying you

976
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,859
and exclaiming that security will come

977
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:13,569
later right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> even these big efforts</font>

978
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:16,300
that have seen that have leaders who

979
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:17,920
have seen things fail having not had

980
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,170
security built in from the beginning are

981
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,650
still proceeding in that way because

982
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:24,700
they think features<font color="#E5E5E5"> first matters the</font>

983
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,100
other thing we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been working group</font>

984
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:31,180
here called<font color="#CCCCCC"> zakum and it's moving really</font>

985
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:35,080
slowly and they're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on being able</font>

986
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:37,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">to validate system hygiene but there's</font>

987
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:39,610
not wide interest in it right there's

988
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:44,290
not a slew of vendors in there there's a

989
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:47,830
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> people from the customer side how do</font>

990
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:49,420
you how do you see this this balance of

991
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:53,319
you think it's we've reached that point

992
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:59,770
but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all these other factors that</font>

993
00:41:53,320 --> 00:42:02,290
points otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> well so sometimes the</font>

994
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:04,030
answer that people give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I get</font>

995
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:05,500
gloomy and do me like this as they say

996
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:07,900
well that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an economics problem not a</font>

997
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology problem my response to that</font>

998
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,500
is that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that technology</font>

999
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:13,150
problems and economics problems aren't

1000
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:16,450
the same problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you're missing the</font>

1001
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:19,360
point that that in some fundamental way

1002
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:20,890
either we figure out how amongst

1003
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,230
ourselves how we're going to do this or

1004
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:25,480
somebody will come<font color="#CCCCCC"> and tell us that</font>

1005
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:27,130
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font>

1006
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">the point that I'm that I'm really</font>

1007
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:31,300
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make here that that we have</font>

1008
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,000
lots and<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of evidence in every</font>

1009
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:36,190
industry that if the technology becomes

1010
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,630
important enough other<font color="#CCCCCC"> people will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

1011
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:39,100
along<font color="#CCCCCC"> and tell you what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and this</font>

1012
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:41,050
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially true in the Internet of</font>

1013
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:42,490
Things area because most of the

1014
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:45,220
so-called things that people are hooking

1015
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:47,500
up our already regulated right<font color="#E5E5E5"> the light</font>

1016
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:49,540
switches and the light bulbs and the and

1017
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,560
the toasters and the refrigerators and

1018
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,150
everything like that they're already

1019
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,279
electrical authorities who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1020
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:59,260
dying to extend their on their power

1021
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:03,070
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so I think that we have</font>

1022
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:04,690
a self-interest here in our industry and

1023
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:07,960
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to figure out how to</font>

1024
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:10,200
convince our collective industry that we

1025
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:13,780
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put put the money into this now</font>

1026
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:16,419
one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we might want to do is is</font>

1027
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:18,610
redefine at least at the standards level

1028
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:20,110
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> might want to do is redefine on</font>

1029
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:21,850
the way we tackle the

1030
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:24,280
things so that instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

1031
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:26,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">features versus security we actually</font>

1032
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked about features exclusively in</font>

1033
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:30,310
terms of their security properties or at

1034
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,529
least<font color="#CCCCCC"> partially in terms of them and we</font>

1035
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:34,150
could do this maybe by thinking a little

1036
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:36,580
bit about how we describe this in

1037
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:38,230
documents because today what we do is we

1038
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">have you know this long document that</font>

1039
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:41,110
describes all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> features and then at</font>

1040
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:43,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end we say and by the way these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1041
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:44,350
the security properties of it and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1042
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,870
could figure out a way to distribute

1043
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:49,360
that through through our documents maybe

1044
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:50,799
that would help I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

1045
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,020
that just hit a trigger I mean if

1046
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,890
anyone's interested in helping on data

1047
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:58,420
models to validate security of different

1048
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:59,650
device types whether it's yang or

1049
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:03,670
something else sockem is going to be

1050
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:05,590
open to it is open to contributions but

1051
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:07,960
they'll they're also very flexible on

1052
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:10,930
what is used to do that validation

1053
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:14,110
knowing that different device types will

1054
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:15,940
use different interfaces and so they

1055
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:18,730
have to be accommodating of that and

1056
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:22,570
that's one way to get towards hygiene

1057
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:28,710
and automated checking of it so help is

1058
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:28,710
welcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm told we have a remote</font>

00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:45,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">really great technical topic it's really</font>

1063
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:48,040
well done congratulations<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Kathleen</font>

and Andrew and the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ideas and</font>

the other speaker from<font color="#CCCCCC"> CloudFlare I just</font>

00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:57,940
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that first of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all I really</font>

1067
00:44:55,870 --> 00:45:00,460
enjoyed<font color="#E5E5E5"> your presentation Andrew I'm</font>

1068
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:02,230
also the person who wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> out mud with a</font>

1072
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:14,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">point is that there is room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1073
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:17,009
everybody to be part of the solution

1074
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:20,500
here so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it that endpoint</font>

1075
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:23,590
manufacturers need to do what is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1076
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:27,610
router and security manufacturers need

1077
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:30,610
to do what is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that governments need</font>

1078
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:33,809
to do and what is it that consumers need

1079
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:35,279
to do and I suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the I</font>

1080
00:45:33,809 --> 00:45:37,349
he is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually in a very good position</font>

1081
00:45:35,279 --> 00:45:41,999
to write out some advice along those

1082
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:43,140
lines as we develop new<font color="#CCCCCC"> tactical</font>

1083
00:45:41,999 --> 00:45:45,118
solutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I couldn't agree with you</font>

1084
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,609
more that if we don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it others will</font>

1085
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:53,670
and i'll probably do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it poorly thank you</font>

1086
00:45:47,609 --> 00:45:57,569
very much no<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think so did you</font>

1087
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:58,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to come Thank You Elliot back to</font>

1090
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:06,689
comment is actually following up from

1091
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:11,729
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elliot's I think he's got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a point</font>

1092
00:46:06,689 --> 00:46:13,319
that nowadays we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have evolved so we</font>

1093
00:46:11,729 --> 00:46:15,209
can learn definitely from from from the

1094
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:18,329
past<font color="#CCCCCC"> and examples you gave it about the</font>

1095
00:46:15,209 --> 00:46:19,769
automotive industries are very valid but

1096
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:21,119
we can also learn from instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

1097
00:46:19,769 --> 00:46:25,709
IANA transition that moved to a

1098
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:26,910
multi-stakeholder idea so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

1099
00:46:25,709 --> 00:46:29,189
wouldn't agree that we are in the best

1100
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:31,558
position but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only as the technical</font>

1101
00:46:29,189 --> 00:46:34,049
community but also representing

1102
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:36,269
manufacturers are commercial the Civil

1103
00:46:34,049 --> 00:46:37,920
associations and so on because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1104
00:46:36,269 --> 00:46:39,988
incentives we make we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to make this</font>

1105
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing work and it's in everyone's</font>

1106
00:46:39,989 --> 00:46:46,439
interest so instead of promoting the

1107
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:48,539
alienation that lately is happening a

1108
00:46:46,439 --> 00:46:50,129
lot between no this is my realm this

1109
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,390
that's your realm we're different we

1110
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:54,329
don't speak to each other I would

1111
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:55,979
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> encourage us trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

1112
00:46:54,329 --> 00:46:57,929
these communities work together and

1113
00:46:55,979 --> 00:47:00,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically make make the internet work</font>

1114
00:46:57,929 --> 00:47:02,729
you got a point and the fact that you

1115
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:05,779
say this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a different idea it's not</font>

1116
00:47:02,729 --> 00:47:08,578
public is private public civil

1117
00:47:05,779 --> 00:47:13,769
individual commercial so we have to

1118
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:17,279
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it differently thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

1119
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:19,859
left hand microphone fish<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the care</font>

1120
00:47:17,279 --> 00:47:23,579
center thank you thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you ah this is</font>

1121
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:27,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">hummus I think it's a good idea as</font>

1122
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:30,989
Andrew<font color="#E5E5E5"> said to us start the dialogue but</font>

1123
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:33,479
as you have put up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the slides the</font>

1124
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:36,869
solutions on that not the only solution

1125
00:47:33,479 --> 00:47:38,968
you mentioned there is one that is quite

1126
00:47:36,869 --> 00:47:41,789
natural for this type of community you

1127
00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:45,739
have equipment network equipment

1128
00:47:41,789 --> 00:47:47,670
manufacturers in your in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be and</font>

1129
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:49,589
so the solution is of

1130
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:51,599
course you have a firewall in the

1131
00:47:49,589 --> 00:47:54,390
network that filters traffic and that

1132
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,130
illustrates the problem while you say we

1133
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:58,230
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach out or you need to be</font>

1134
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:59,970
inclusive and so on you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually need to</font>

1135
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:01,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">get these other people on board because</font>

1136
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:03,808
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently working on all</font>

1137
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:07,530
different venues and specifically there

1138
00:48:03,809 --> 00:48:10,619
are very few chip manufacturers in the

1139
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:12,540
IDF who could contribute this also from

1140
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:14,670

industry that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult to</font>

1142
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:20,790
come up with a solution that they would

<font color="#E5E5E5">even recognize Richard bonds and key is</font>

1144
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:25,410
more myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> I put together document that</font>

1145
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:28,828
that focuses more on the security of the

<font color="#CCCCCC">IAD device itself and if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

1147
00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:31,859
through it you will notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

1148
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:33,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually not so easy to come up with</font>

1149
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:37,440
some recommendations that could

1150
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:40,290
potentially be enforceable by by a

1151
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:45,839
regulation in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in a hopefully better</font>

1152
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:48,599
style of<font color="#CCCCCC"> pc PCI DSS and so I encourage</font>

1153
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:50,970
the IAB to reach out to those other

1154
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:54,780
stakeholders and not just to look around

1155
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:57,990
the usual suspects<font color="#E5E5E5"> who obviously see a</font>

1156
00:48:54,780 --> 00:49:00,720
great opportunity to sell some new

00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:02,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">Firebirds because I don't think that</font>

1158
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,439
that alone will sort of solve the

1159
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:06,780
problem if it will solve the problem at

1160
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,869
all because<font color="#E5E5E5"> those parties who had not</font>

1161
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:11,579
been interested to use any security

1162
00:49:09,869 --> 00:49:13,890
mechanisms they will hardly be

1163
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:16,109
interested to implement or even know

1164
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:18,299
about this other security mechanism so

1165
00:49:16,109 --> 00:49:19,859
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it sounds a little bit bizarre</font>

1166
00:49:18,299 --> 00:49:22,920
band they haven't done the obvious thing

1167
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:25,078
why would<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do like manufacturer</font>

1168
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,000
certificates with some new innovative

description but some fireballs in every

00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">network so I'm really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> glad that you</font>

1171
00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:36,630
pointed out that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are multiple</font>

multiple ways or multiple levels that we

got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tackle this at and I agree with</font>

00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:44,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">you I I was sort of trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the examples of light just because I I</font>

1176
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:49,049
mean that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential here is very</font>

1177
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,369
wide but I think you're exactly right

1178
00:49:49,049 --> 00:49:52,440
but we don't want it we don't want to

1179
00:49:50,369 --> 00:49:54,540
use only one strategy and this was part

1180
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,250
of the reason I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was so happy that Nick</font>

was going to was was here to join us

1182
00:49:56,250 --> 00:50:00,240
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's nice for instance</font>

1183
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,349
to have an operator speaking at an ietf

1184
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,879
meeting

1185
00:50:01,349 --> 00:50:04,650
I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a that's a thing</font>

1186
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,839
that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get often enough and so</font>

1187
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:08,729
like we're all going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do this</font>

1188
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:13,229
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that you're you're precisely</font>

correct about that thank you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

the left microphone is next oh do we

days<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the notion not you can just say</font>

1196
00:50:32,609 --> 00:50:39,479
big one on whatever and we've had

1197
00:50:34,979 --> 00:50:42,930
similar problems on<font color="#E5E5E5"> pcs on mobile</font>

1198
00:50:39,479 --> 00:50:45,509
devices and most of those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1199
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:47,489
protocol problems it's not like somebody

1200
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:50,369
discovered a vulnerability in a crypto

1201
00:50:47,489 --> 00:50:52,559
algorithm or in TLS or whatever visa

1202
00:50:50,369 --> 00:50:55,259
just pretty dumb implementation problems

1203
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:58,799
as in HUD coding passwords is not

1204
00:50:55,259 --> 00:51:04,319
exactly a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp level thing that we need</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to write up I and I would bet none of</font>

unlikely to to be quite honest and the

excitations from a day<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't going to</font>

change my behavior mind actress

00:51:22,469 --> 00:51:25,519
recognizable and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think government</font>

1214
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:28,440
people are smart enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recognize</font>

1215
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:32,430
incentives and currently we are none I

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hanas mentioned PCI DSS and I think</font>

1217
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:36,450
that's an instructive example we are

1218
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:38,460
case you don't know what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's</font>

1219
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:40,950
where if you accept credit cards on your

<font color="#E5E5E5">web server you have to get certified</font>

they are otherwise you don't get to

accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> credit cards that's not a not</font>

1226
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:56,609
governmental thing that's because we

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two big entities Visa and</font>

better option I not so I do encourage

1231
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:09,299
people to come talk to government

1232
00:52:07,049 --> 00:52:12,509
agencies and I certainly be happy to

talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people I do advise that the we</font>

1234
00:52:12,509 --> 00:52:16,360
will solve it somehow

at some point indefinite in the future

1236
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:21,370
with some magic is not a good starting

1237
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:23,740
point of that discussion and because

1238
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:25,359
usually that means somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

1239
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,919
political<font color="#E5E5E5"> realm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will have to take the</font>

I'm solutions are very much is a fertile

1244
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:42,370
time for poop proposing solutions but

1245

they can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be Oh we'll all just</font>

1247
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:49,900
get together and won't solve that

1248
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,700
magically simply because there's no

1249
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:55,480

anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who thinks these problems are</font>

we still<font color="#CCCCCC"> need time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the IB and IC is</font>

true but Sarah Michael Dave Crocker so

00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:20,770
thank you for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this session not just</font>

1260
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:23,740
timely but nicely done and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you</font>

1261
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:25,930
raised some basic questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we then</font>

1262
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:28,060
have the challenge of figuring out not

1263
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:30,310
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to answer as much as how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

1264
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:33,070
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the kinds of questions</font>

1265
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:35,410
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues you raised point in the right</font>

1266
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:37,530
direction of trying to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

1267
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:40,120
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that so for regulation I</font>

1268
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:43,900
liked that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you distinguish between what</font>

1269
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:46,839
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> are two kinds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of regulations the</font>

1270
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:49,900
low-hanging relatively easy fruit to at

1271
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:51,340
least think about is requiring use of

1272
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:53,410
things that already exist with known

1273
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:56,950
efficacy benefit costs and all the rest

1274
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:59,109
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one might call those standards</font>

1275
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:01,540
with teeth the other are the

1276
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:04,540
aspirational ones thou shalt eventually

1277
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:06,640
reduce pollution by some amount those

1278
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:07,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">only makes sense if we have a good basis</font>

1279
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,730
for believing we know how to achieve

those even if we don't know now how to

1281
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:14,980
we have a skill set that says we're

1282

probably going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to for much of</font>

1290
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:40,349
across the entire internet for enough of

1291
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:42,119
the things that might need regulating

1292
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:47,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">never mind that we don't have consensus</font>

1293
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:50,130
on what the regulation should be a

1294

comment that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just made hints at a</font>

1295
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:53,460
point that we we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in mind</font>

1296
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:56,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Internet has been under attack many</font>

00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:58,740

been we have exceeded limits we've

1301
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:07,619
exceeded styles of use and we have

1302
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:11,609
broken things NSFNET broke the backbone

1303
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:14,660
routing a service in fact it was being

1304
00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:16,470
broken periodically but NSFNET

1305
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:21,089
institutionalized it and forced the

1306
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:22,859
creation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP in the late 80s</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I I</font>

1307
00:55:21,089 --> 00:55:25,109
think there<font color="#E5E5E5"> may have been more than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

1308
00:55:22,859 --> 00:55:28,109
of these but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a burst of</font>

1309
00:55:25,109 --> 00:55:30,200
activity to deal with TCP congestion to

1310
00:55:28,109 --> 00:55:34,589
deal with certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds of efficiencies</font>

1311
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:38,069
and there were was almost a a cornucopia

1312
00:55:34,589 --> 00:55:41,430
of efforts some of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> very disciplined</font>

1313
00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:45,810
some of them very<font color="#E5E5E5"> narrow we don't really</font>

1314
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:48,328
have an equivalent marketplace<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

1315
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:50,819
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is research it's very focused</font>

1316
00:55:48,329 --> 00:55:54,390
research very practical with him with a

00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:56,310
goal very<font color="#CCCCCC"> near-term delivery and the</font>

1318
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:58,589
discussions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that surrounded that I mean</font>

1319
00:55:56,310 --> 00:56:01,109
was pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool and in in those days</font>

1320
00:55:58,589 --> 00:56:03,029
come to an ITF meeting and watch the

1321
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:05,910
various proposals being talked about and

1322
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:10,460
justified and that's what we need to I

1323
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:12,779
think move to pretty quickly thank you

1324
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:15,900
next at the center Mike and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I'll go</font>

1325
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:17,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to love Jimmy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yep yeah hi Bob</font>

1326
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:20,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">hindin yeah thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you again for doing</font>

1327
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:23,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">this this is very topical and important</font>

1328
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:28,290
I'm actually personally pretty terrified

1329
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:30,779
about this I agree with one of the

1330
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:32,490
Sullivans up there that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the</font>

1331
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:35,700
beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of something and it's only</font>

1332
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:38,848
going to get a lot worse I'm i think the

1333
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:39,558
ITF needs to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1334
00:56:38,849 --> 00:56:41,689
because

1335
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:43,219
well it's easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that regulation</font>

1336
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:45,680
could happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I don't think anybody</font>

1337
00:56:43,219 --> 00:56:48,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">knows what to what the regulation would</font>

1338
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:51,348
do and it's particularly hard I think

1339
00:56:48,829 --> 00:56:54,049
much harder than the car example because

1340
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:56,239
the internet is so international<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

1341
00:56:54,049 --> 00:56:59,420
you could have I'll just for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

1342
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:00,890
have good regulations in Canada but then

1343
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:03,739
you're going to get bought attacks from

1344
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:06,199
the US or you know substitute any set of

1345
00:57:03,739 --> 00:57:09,589
countries so<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless it's all fairly</font>

1346
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:12,469
uniform that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not going to help too</font>

1347
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:15,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">much or at least as much as it should so</font>

1348
00:57:12,469 --> 00:57:18,680
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do a lot to help I think</font>

1349
00:57:15,589 --> 00:57:21,769
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem here is in having</font>

1350
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:25,098
endpoints that protect don't get turned

1351
00:57:21,769 --> 00:57:27,410
into botnets and I think we can besides

1352
00:57:25,099 --> 00:57:30,619
making the protocols better<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we</font>

1353
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:32,890
can also write words that you know have

1354
00:57:30,619 --> 00:57:36,199
best current practices of what

1355
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:38,029
reasonably secure devices are and then

1356
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:41,180
that will give people who build them or

1357
00:57:38,029 --> 00:57:43,519
sell them or if they have to regulate

1358
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:47,779
them have something to actually look at

1359
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:53,359
to base that on thank you I'm 4i left

1360
00:57:47,779 --> 00:57:55,369
microphone please Tom Herbert so I'd

1361
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:57,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to give one example in the open</font>

1362
00:57:55,369 --> 00:57:59,119
source community where we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1363
00:57:57,109 --> 00:58:01,759
address part of this problem so I

1364
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:05,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe Nick mentioned that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CloudFlare</font>

1365
00:58:01,759 --> 00:58:06,890
was using iptables and BPF and we're

1366
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:09,380
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> about 1.2 million packets per</font>

1367
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:11,689
second drop over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past year we've</font>

1368
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:13,219
actually been looking at this number is

1369
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:15,799
really pretty bad mean think about it

1370
00:58:13,219 --> 00:58:18,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we can increase that by tenfold with</font>

1371
00:58:15,799 --> 00:58:20,839
something called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Express datapath xdp</font>

1372
00:58:18,259 --> 00:58:22,309
and it's kind of interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1373
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:25,249
we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on this and people</font>

1374
00:58:22,309 --> 00:58:27,079
kept asking us why why is a packet drop

1375
00:58:25,249 --> 00:58:29,118
so important why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you focused on this</font>

1376
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:31,699
well it's for denial of service and

1377
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:33,739
hence we have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion so I think</font>

1378
00:58:31,699 --> 00:58:37,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of validates where we're going</font>

1379
00:58:33,739 --> 00:58:41,900
with a lot of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Center</font>

1380
00:58:37,429 --> 00:58:44,839

1382
00:58:44,839 --> 00:58:51,469
talked about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you must be this tall</font>

1383
00:58:47,209 --> 00:58:52,310
to ride problem and I know this is a

1384
00:58:51,469 --> 00:58:53,900
discussion about what

1385
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:58,990
the internet architecture itself might

1386
00:58:53,900 --> 00:59:01,190
be potentially a a thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1387
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:03,319
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could point fingers at as</font>

1388
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:05,600
this is why we have so much risk in our

1389
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:08,330
in our system and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> to myself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1390
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:10,670
so what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the architectural features</font>

1391
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:12,290
of the internet that that make it so

1392
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:15,290
that it's a playground for asymmetric

1393
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:18,410
warfare right and the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that</font>

1394
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:22,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes to mind there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that well some</font>

1395
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:26,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago I was the technical editor for</font>

1396
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:28,730
an RFC that described the simple

1397
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:31,910
security characteristics of residential

1398
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:35,150
gateways where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea was unmanaged</font>

1399
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:37,399
home networks but gosh they have to have

1400
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:40,970
a firewall that is completely unmanaged

1401
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:43,910
by people and I worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that despite</font>

1402
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:46,549
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not wanting to because from my</font>

1403
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:49,310
perspective I wanted there to be you

1404
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:51,260
know a transparent ability to get in and

1405
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:53,900
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of home networks so that it was</font>

1406
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:57,140
possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build applications that you</font>

didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> running a secure data</font>

00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:01,790
center with lots of centralized pipes

1409
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:04,340
you could distribute data around the

1410
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:05,960
edges of the network and maybe have

1411
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:08,240
another way of making something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

1412
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:11,240
robust against distributed

1414
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:15,950
whether that's necessarily a way to

1415
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,530
solve this problem but we kind of built

1416
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:20,529
an architecture that says no that's not

1417
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:24,860
going to be possible at all we always

1418
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:28,100
turn on firewalls that<font color="#CCCCCC"> block incoming</font>

01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:31,730
remote addresses arbitrary remote

1421
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:33,350
addresses can't get through these

1422
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:36,620
firewalls because they're always turned

1423
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:39,440
on and it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me like we sort of</font>

1424
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:43,370
did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on purpose I don't know how we</font>

1425
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:44,690
can change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that part of the architecture</font>

1426
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:46,700
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there seems to be like</font>

1427
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:48,860
widespread consensus that this is all

1428
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:51,310
good and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do but</font>

1429
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:56,210
it's the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes the internet</font>

1430
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:57,770
an asymmetric warfare playground so if

1431
01:00:56,210 --> 01:01:00,350
we're going to live<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a world that's</font>

1432
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:03,470
forever going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be asymmetric warfare</font>

1433
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:04,029
until the end of time maybe we just kind

1434
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:06,250
of have to

1435
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:08,440
hope that people who do policy and

1436
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:10,660
regulations will tell us<font color="#CCCCCC"> how they want</font>

1437
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:15,130
it regulated and then we can build

1438
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:16,540
technology to apply those policies but

1439
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:18,700
we're not a policy development

1440
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:24,400
organization here we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1441
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:27,609
engineers so so yes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you put</font>

1442
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:29,320
your finger on on something here so so I

1443
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:33,160
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're right that we made an</font>

1444
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:36,190
actual decision at some point to to to

1445
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:38,470
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right we pretend that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

1446
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:40,120
got this this you know dumb network with

1447
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:41,589
all the intelligence out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the edge and</font>

1448
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:43,750
so on and then if you look at it

1449
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:45,400
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got classes of network on</font>

1450
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:47,860
that are in there so it's already false

1451
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:50,110
you've got access networks versus you

1452
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:51,490
know infrastructure networks and

1453
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:53,050
providers networks and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1454
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:56,799
are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> different classes of network</font>

1455
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:58,510
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different properties and on we</font>

1456
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,650
we sort of pretend to ourselves that

1457
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:01,660
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the same but they really</font>

1458
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:04,540
aren't at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way they're deployed</font>

1459
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:06,040
today the deployment is not really it's

1460
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:07,509
not really completely separate from the

1461
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,800
architecture right that there's this

1462
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:09,730
idea that you've got the architecture

1463
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got this completely</font>

1464
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:13,570
separate thing of deploying it and I

1465
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's sort of lying</font>

1466
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:18,400
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ourselves but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what this means of</font>

1467
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:21,040
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that we could decide that what</font>

1468
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:24,160
we wanted to do was build on protocols

1469
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:26,380
that that tended to distribute data in a

1470
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:28,629
secure way instead intended to push

1471
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:30,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">things back out to the edge now maybe we</font>

1472
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:33,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">got to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in a network that doesn't</font>

1473
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:35,770
allow the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of arbitrary and a</font>

1474
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:38,230
point-to-point connect connection that

1475
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:40,360
the original internet model had but but

1476
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:42,100
if we think about this in terms of the

1477
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:44,050
kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of services and data that we push</font>

1478
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:45,460
to various<font color="#E5E5E5"> places it could be that</font>

1479
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:47,710
actually what we would be doing is

1480
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:50,890
recreating that on that older feature

1481
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:52,390
and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that is because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1482
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:54,100
purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this was to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1483
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:55,960
data moving around and so maybe what

1484
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:57,880
we've got is like this hangover of this

1485
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:00,190
kind of kludgy middle thing with all the

1486
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:01,360
firewalls in between and so on and yet

1487
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:03,220
you still might end up with the

1488
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:05,560
properties of pushing the things out to

1489
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:06,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the edge so that the applications that</font>

1490
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:10,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">are living</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there on the edge would</font>

1491
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:12,399
have we have the local freedom to do

1492
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:14,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">these kinds of things I don't know how</font>

1493
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:17,140
all of that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of picture of the</font>

1494
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:17,819
future plays out but it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1495
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:20,009
if we started

1496
01:03:17,819 --> 01:03:21,959
talking about about<font color="#E5E5E5"> alternatives to the</font>

1497
01:03:20,009 --> 01:03:24,569
way we've deployed stuff that looked

1498
01:03:21,959 --> 01:03:26,549
along these lines it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually you</font>

1499
01:03:24,569 --> 01:03:27,808
know turn our gaze to a system that was

1500
01:03:26,549 --> 01:03:29,459
there in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past we might learn</font>

1501
01:03:27,809 --> 01:03:31,289
something from it and maybe we could

1502
01:03:29,459 --> 01:03:33,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">build maybe we could recreate some of</font>

1503
01:03:31,289 --> 01:03:37,410
the advantages that we had before well

1504
01:03:33,329 --> 01:03:39,749
the IAB be taking up this this question

1505
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:41,578
and units well I'm challenge and its

1506
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:43,288
future deliberations about that that's

1507
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:44,430
an excellent question i guess the IV is

1508
01:03:43,289 --> 01:03:46,259
going to march up here in a little bit

1509
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:48,448
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can grill us about whether we've</font>

1510
01:03:46,259 --> 01:03:50,400
really got a plan for this I i can say

1511
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:53,819
that i do not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a plan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for how to do</font>

1512
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,349
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like a bridgehead thing</font>

1513
01:03:53,819 --> 01:03:57,630
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've got here you know I've got</font>

1514
01:03:55,349 --> 01:03:58,920
this idea here is the sort of problem

1515
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:00,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">that i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and i know i've gotten this</font>

1516
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,890
far but it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if i look</font>

1517
01:04:00,329 --> 01:04:03,630
out that way it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different picture</font>

1518
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:05,279
than if i look out that way and maybe I

1519
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:07,519
can figure out which way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go next</font>

1520
01:04:05,279 --> 01:04:11,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you for making this presentation</font>

1521
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:13,049
thank you um we're running a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

1522
01:04:11,009 --> 01:04:17,549
short on time<font color="#CCCCCC"> but when we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1523
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:19,349
and Eric you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> next Eric nordmark so I</font>

1524
01:04:17,549 --> 01:04:21,059
think it's clearly that from an

1525
01:04:19,349 --> 01:04:23,069
operational sort of the scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1526
01:04:21,059 --> 01:04:24,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet the thing you talked about in</font>

1527
01:04:23,069 --> 01:04:26,880
terms of the focus on how do we cope

1528
01:04:24,959 --> 01:04:28,890
with these attacks right or you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1529
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,180
malicious load spikes that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1530
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:32,368
that we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

1531
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:35,009
better at<font color="#E5E5E5"> but as people point out this</font>

1532
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:37,499
is a symmetric in terms of the cost to

1533
01:04:35,009 --> 01:04:39,599
the attacker versus the cost to defend

1534
01:04:37,499 --> 01:04:42,029
against that if you have these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1535
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:45,119
with admin admin username password the

1536
01:04:42,029 --> 01:04:48,299
cost to attack is close to<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero right so</font>

1537
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:50,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think that yes we don't actually build</font>

1538
01:04:48,299 --> 01:04:52,559
those devices that sit at the edge but

1539
01:04:50,309 --> 01:04:55,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe we have expertise here in the IDF</font>

1540
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:57,930
in terms of what's the sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> state of</font>

1541
01:04:55,049 --> 01:05:00,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">the art what software can be used if we</font>

1542
01:04:57,930 --> 01:05:02,848
invite those people and show them some

1543
01:05:00,569 --> 01:05:05,130
running code right maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can help</font>

1544
01:05:02,849 --> 01:05:07,499
move that side forward as well because I

1545
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:10,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that we should figure out how we</font>

1546
01:05:07,499 --> 01:05:11,910
can look at the whole end-to-end part of

1547
01:05:10,049 --> 01:05:14,190
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the puzzle and not just only</font>

1548
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:16,199
look at how can we defend<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside the</font>

1549
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:17,969
network and then we might be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1550
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:20,519
two solutions quicker here sure we will

1551
01:05:17,969 --> 01:05:22,829
still have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tax right or various forms</font>

1552
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:24,538
from various devices but but we can move

1553
01:05:22,829 --> 01:05:26,430
the whole front forward I supposed to

1554
01:05:24,539 --> 01:05:29,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">only moving</font>

1555
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:32,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you center Mike this lorenzo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> glee</font>

1556
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:34,900
at two things first of all for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nat64</font>

1557
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:36,490
network so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IB recommends that all</font>

01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:39,010
networking standards assume a use of

1559
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:41,620
ipv6 henceforth and be written so they

1560
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:43,330
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not require</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP before I would posit</font>

1561
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:45,250
that if we're here<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the ITF to do work</font>

1562
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:48,069
then that's what the default<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

1563
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:50,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">six only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network should be so we should</font>

1564
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:51,790
make the network nat64 by default

1565
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:53,520
because that's what we're trying to do

1566
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:57,610
here we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to design protocols so</font>

1567
01:05:53,520 --> 01:06:00,790
with that in mind another thing so if we

1568
01:05:57,610 --> 01:06:02,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">want we like end-to-end right and if we</font>

1569
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:04,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">want the Internet to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be end to end and</font>

1570
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:05,620
we want it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be secure then the</font>

1571
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:07,810
security has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be at the edges right</font>

1572
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:09,490
otherwise we can't continue the existing

1573
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:12,580
model now before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we throw away the model</font>

1574
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:15,490
which try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix it now the observations</font>

1575
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:17,110
here is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the security models of I</font>

1576
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:19,240
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think any of our protocols are</font>

1577
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:21,760
broken I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can fix any</font>

1578
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:23,250
protocols to fix this problem because

1579
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,510
the protocols aren't you attack vector

1580
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:27,760
seems to me that the attack vector is

1581
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:30,370
code that nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> cares to update because</font>

1582
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:34,420
they have absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero incentive to</font>

1583
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:35,920
update it now it's like into I write

1584
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:37,810
code that goes into Android right and

1585
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,970
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a billion devices and</font>

1586
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:42,270
manufacturers updated they don't update

1587
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:46,000
it may be the update it maybe they don't

1588
01:06:42,270 --> 01:06:48,160
for an IOT device there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely</font>

1589
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,230
zero incentive to put any security at

1590
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,250
all in your initial build<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it</font>

1591
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:54,070
means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be behind</font>

1592
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:56,440
somebody else and I don't see I don't

1593
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:58,780
see a good way around that except<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

1594
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:01,300
okay you map you must be this tall you

1595
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:03,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">know to connect to the internet now what</font>

1596
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:05,890
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> our role be in that our role might</font>

1597
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:09,250
be to say okay here's a protocol that we

1598
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:11,589
can build so that advice can say in a in

1599
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:13,570
a secure way here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the latest security</font>

1600
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:16,240
update that I have and it's signed by my

1601
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:18,820
manufacturers key and I support all

1602
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:20,979
these TVs and I fix them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1603
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:23,020
while once we have that trusted at the

1604
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:25,060
station we can say okay well okay here's

1605
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:27,070
a bunch of bad devices and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font>

1606
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:28,600
decide what to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> about them and and</font>

1607
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:30,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a technical solutions not</font>

1608
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:32,500
attacking a problem but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's providing a</font>

1609
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:34,930
means that that somebody could use to

1610
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:37,030
solve the problem in ways that are not

1611
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:37,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to necessarily change the model</font>

1612
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:40,960
completely

1613
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:43,690
and so I don't know what are your

1614
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,609
thoughts on that but well I mostly agree

1615
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:47,410
with you but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a little quibble I</font>

1616
01:07:45,609 --> 01:07:49,299
think with one of your premises which is

1617
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:51,759
that like the the protocols aren't

1618
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:53,529
broken so I agree with integrating with

1619
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:56,829
you that individual protocols may be

1620
01:07:53,529 --> 01:07:59,529
accepting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS are not broken in</font>

1621
01:07:56,829 --> 01:08:01,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">their in their fundamental I think what</font>

1622
01:07:59,529 --> 01:08:04,089
I am partially arguing is that what

1623
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:06,460
we've done is we've designed we've

1624
01:08:04,089 --> 01:08:09,119
designed a system which has as its

1625
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:12,760
property this this basic vulnerability

1626
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:16,029
and and the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that cannot</font>

1627
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:18,460
be well we need the end points to to be

1628
01:08:16,029 --> 01:08:20,020
to behave correctly because if you're

1629
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:22,689
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to design a system in which</font>

1630
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:24,400
there's no barrier to entry and you

1631
01:08:22,689 --> 01:08:26,139
don't have you know you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have sort</font>

1632
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:28,420
of access controls for who gets to come

1633
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:29,500
on then you have to assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font>

1634
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:32,500
those people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to do bad stuff</font>

1635
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:34,929
and so the model<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we had was a</font>

1636
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:36,279
perfectly good one for a network<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

1637
01:08:34,929 --> 01:08:38,290
you could right away to the network

1638
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:39,969
information center and get a list on

1639
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:42,850
paper of all of the humans that were

1640
01:08:39,969 --> 01:08:45,489
connected to it but we passed that thing

1641
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:47,980
some time ago and we haven't done

1642
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:49,988
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about our model of who gets to</font>

1643
01:08:47,979 --> 01:08:51,639
join and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font>

1644
01:08:49,988 --> 01:08:53,608
that I'm worried about is that the

1645
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:55,569
network doesn't have any other on

1646
01:08:53,609 --> 01:08:57,179
protections against this it's really

1647
01:08:55,569 --> 01:08:59,920
just got like once you're in you're in

1648
01:08:57,179 --> 01:09:02,259
you know our bodies<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't work that way</font>

1649
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,850
um you know you get through the skin and

1650
01:09:02,259 --> 01:09:06,310
you're still going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be like you know</font>

1651
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:07,690
defended against whereas what we've got

1652
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:10,540
really is you get through the skin and

1653
01:09:07,689 --> 01:09:12,488
hey you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> wide open here and that seems</font>

1654
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:14,979
to me like a difference that we could do

1655
01:09:12,488 --> 01:09:17,889
something about if we adopted a sort of

1656
01:09:14,979 --> 01:09:20,620
immune response a sort of environment to

1657
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:21,880
this so I likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest the suggestion</font>

1658
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:24,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you make that what you could do is</font>

1659
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:26,679
say hey wait a minute we've sent out

1660
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:28,719
this this inoculation against this

1661
01:09:26,679 --> 01:09:30,520
problem and you're not behaving like

1662
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:32,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're inoculated well we can we can</font>

1663
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:35,949
then identify you there there might be

1664
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:37,629
something in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on the protocols no</font>

1665
01:09:35,948 --> 01:09:39,939
protocol is broken if it doesn't survive

1666
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:41,409
a two thousand to one attack I mean it's

1667
01:09:39,939 --> 01:09:43,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">just not in the design space right</font>

1668
01:09:41,408 --> 01:09:45,040
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a million hosts trying to</font>

1669
01:09:43,089 --> 01:09:48,068
attack 10 machines what are you going to

1670
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:50,620
do uh yeah so I'm a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

1671
01:09:48,069 --> 01:09:51,700
tempered on on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I kind of agree with</font>

1672
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:55,030
you that

1673
01:09:51,700 --> 01:10:00,700
if we can build software or do work that

1674
01:09:55,030 --> 01:10:02,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes it easier cheaper and reduces the</font>

1675
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:05,440
friction for people building these

1676
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:07,420
devices to have security by default I

1677
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:11,049
think it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve things in a one</font>

1678
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:13,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred percent case but the more</font>

1679
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:16,030
security we have the better and and

1680
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:18,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's sort of one of the main points of</font>

1681
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:21,219
my presentation is that it is about

1682
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:24,309
scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you can handle something</font>

1683
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:25,810
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten times bigger maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

1684
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:27,850
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> times bigger if you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce</font>

1685
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:29,890
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem then then that's that's</font>

1686
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:31,660
better than then a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1687
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:35,020

1688
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:36,580
reduce the asymmetry<font color="#E5E5E5"> next please yeah my</font>

simulators to think on redesigning maybe

1698
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:02,740
the internet architecture there are also

1699
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:07,210
other challenges that are related to

1700
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:11,800
privacy so protection of personal data

1701
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:14,590
and then data ownership and in addition

1702
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:18,250
to that you mentioned regulation the

1703
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:20,980
European Commission<font color="#CCCCCC"> European Parliament</font>

1704
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:23,410
is actually working on the general data

1705
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:28,089
protocol protection regulation so they

1706
01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:30,639
have already defined certain regulation

1707
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:34,150
on privacy and there is all they are

1708
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:37,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">also grabs on technology so and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1709
01:11:34,150 --> 01:11:39,099
might also stimulate us to think also<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1710
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:45,070
that area so in addition to security

1711
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:46,990
also privates type of topics<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font>

1712
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:49,690
get the last word except<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me hi</font>

01:11:56,980 --> 01:12:01,269

<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet</font>

01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:11,519
and have them implement it immediately

1723
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:13,410

1728
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:25,500
to regulation I'm a big fan of what's

1729
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:27,989
called back door regulation and what I

1730
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:29,910
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is there are regulations in</font>

place having<font color="#E5E5E5"> with things like insurance</font>

1732
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:33,929
for example different types of insurance

1733
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:36,360
the organizations have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry</font>

1734
01:12:33,929 --> 01:12:38,429
different types of policies and levels

01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:39,839
of policies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they have to carry the</font>

cause of laws<font color="#CCCCCC"> and regulations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,290
often transnational in nature I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just had</font>

1738
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,780
a very interesting conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:53,400

1745
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:58,530
have an in-depth chat with you about

your quote cyber unquote policies that

1747

you're writing because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you have</font>

1752
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:14,580
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a one way to get in</font>

1753
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:15,600
some backdoor regulation essentially

1754

through the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the insurance</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">underwriters they'll let them understand</font>

1756
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:20,910
that they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start really auditing</font>

1757
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:23,550
organizations that they write policies

1758
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:24,960
for another another comment I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1759
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:27,030
terms of regulation is the government's

01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:29,219
actually have a fantastic way to

1761

regulate without regulating it's called

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFP the request for proposal on</font>

1763
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:37,339
governments can specify vendors that

1764
01:13:35,219 --> 01:13:39,360
they purchase things from services from

1765
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:41,400
including things like internet transit

1766
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:44,219
and so forth they can specify that

1767
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:45,860
verifiable steps have been taken by

1768
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:48,810
those organizations to implement

1769
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:51,299
reasonable on best current practices

<font color="#CCCCCC">dead the industry recognizes so i would</font>

encourage folks to cozy up to your local

local purchasing folks in government and

talk to them about this because there

01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:07,259
are ways to get regulation without

different types of technological things

01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:18,659
we're doing and finally um large jury

1781
01:14:16,739 --> 01:14:20,610
verdicts are also

1782
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:22,799
a good incentive to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get folks to do</font>

things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think that there's a lot of</font>

01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:33,449
because there are doctrines like
