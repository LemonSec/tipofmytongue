00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,740
bluetooths SBC<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got a response that</font>

says that they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interest</font>

it also based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but I would since</font>

77
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:10,030
we didn't get any other response on the

78
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,799
list on that we we intend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that and</font>

79
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:16,020
I'd like also to ask you in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting</font>

80
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:20,050
if anyone has any objection to us

81
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:22,180
removing those milestones and of course

82
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,190
removing those documents from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the from</font>

83
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:28,480
did they are expired anyhow all this

84
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:30,990
document so any anyone object to

85
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:36,130
removing this for document it's the EVP

86
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:38,650
rg7 18 for Papa standard the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AIESEC</font>

88
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:44,399
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care because they've now the</font>

89
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:46,859
opposite or whatever the SBC and does

90
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,739
the mpeg-2 TS which I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

91
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:51,239
have any that was between I talked to

92
00:06:49,739 --> 00:06:55,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">his early about it we don't have any</font>

93
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:58,198
motivation to continue with that so um

94
00:06:55,369 --> 00:07:02,819
if there are no objections we'll just

95
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:04,799
remove those milestones so I don't see

96
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:08,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone running to the mic was objecting</font>

97
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:11,008
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do that Ben will need</font>

98
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:17,149
to discuss how how to remove those

99
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:20,339
milestones right just remove them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

100
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:23,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay okay so we'll remove those</font>

102
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:30,899
we have the feck the perfect the fact we

103
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:34,589
have the vp9 video codec will need to

104
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:38,479
update the the milestone date for that

105
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:41,639
one we have the map which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope will</font>

106
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,709
submit it for soon<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to publication</font>

107
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,279
when we're done with this and we now

108
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:51,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a milestone also for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> VC to H</font>

116
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:25,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> straight into what the major</font>

117
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,389
changes were there's really only two

118
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:33,949
major changes there was a decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

119
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:36,890
the last ITF in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Berlin to remove the the</font>

120
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:39,919
non<font color="#E5E5E5"> XOR codes so the non parody codes</font>

121
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:43,458
out of this draft so there was a raptor

122
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:47,630
and reed-solomon planned as as alternate

123
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:49,459
codes negotiated through<font color="#CCCCCC"> rstp but that</font>

124
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense has been removed from the draft</font>

125
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:54,859
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most major change there's a</font>

126
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:56,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of text</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> removed for that so the plan</font>

127
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:01,399
is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have new drafts that cover those</font>

128
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:05,000
different formats so flex is not

129
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,350
not so flexible anymore and you have to

130
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,980
have multiple types now if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

131
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:12,950
use any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of his other codes the second</font>

132
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:17,690
major change was there was a

133
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:20,839
retransmission format that was added 11

134
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:24,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">rev ago and people commented that it was</font>

135
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:29,149
relatively inefficient compared to the

136
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:30,410
RFC 4588<font color="#CCCCCC"> r-tx and so we looked at the</font>

137
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:33,170
packet format and try to do some

138
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:36,740
reduction of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fields that would not</font>

139
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:39,500
be necessary so we we got it down to 12

140
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:43,339
bytes I'll show a minute what what the

141
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:46,300
differences were but basically you know

142
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:49,010
it's now three words instead of four to

143
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:52,069
four to eight words for a full effect

144
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:56,839
header but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's still not as efficient</font>

145
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:58,839
as 4588 the the old retransmission

146
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:01,690
header is only two bytes there's a

147
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:03,680
original sequence number and that's it

148
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:07,160
everything else is basically inherited

149
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,829
from the RTP header so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

150
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of friction here that if we try to</font>

151
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:14,839
if we try to reduce the overhead too

152
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,729
much and we lose some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the benefits of</font>

flexible affect the point of flexible

154
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,390
effect is to have flexibility to do

00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">multiple things you could cover multiple</font>

163
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,769
possible if we collapsed all the way

down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the 4588 format so if you look</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">at all the stuff that it that it doesn't</font>

166
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,829
allow to be different as sir see the

167
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:58,029
timestamp the payload type all of those

168
00:10:53,829 --> 00:11:01,239
things cannot be flexible under 4588

169
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:03,550
they have to be either derived from stp

170
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:09,180
or they have to mirror exactly what was

171
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:12,189
in the original stream so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're</font>

172
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:15,279
maybe pretty close to the right

173
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:17,379
trade-off but if anybody has ideas that

174
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,279
they'd like to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down even</font>

175
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:23,410
further or we're open to pushing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:27,550
trade off even more towards efficiency

00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:29,949
instead of flexibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so next</font>

178
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:32,500
slide please so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the new</font>

179
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:34,269

181
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:40,209
this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual effect payload which</font>

182
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:41,920
starts off with what is essentially an

00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:45,729
RTP header this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> arts be either of</font>

184
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">the original packet and so there's a the</font>

185
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:50,259
change was we removed length recovery

186
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:51,638
which doesn't make any sense if you're

187
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:53,339
protecting a single packet you don't

188
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:55,779
need the length recovery field anymore

189
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,130
so the length recovery was removed and

190
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:58,899
we moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sequence number up into</font>

191
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:05,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">that spot so now looks a lot more like a</font>

192
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:08,350
an old old style RTP header and the the

193
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:11,079
SSRC count field is removed and it's

194
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,850
reserved bits are also removed so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

195
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:15,219
don't end up with three words of

196
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,959
overhead 12 bytes of overhead you know

197
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,350
followed by the actual payload and

198
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,540
payload here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CSRC list</font>

199
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:27,399
and the extension headers and then the

200
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:29,980
real payload of the original packet<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

201
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:33,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">right next slide please</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

202
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:35,860
also some minor changes there was a in

203
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,520
order to optimize the retransmission

204
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,840
format

205
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:42,790
we had to swap the the first two bits of

206
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,500
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> format the are bit the</font>

207
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:48,250
retransmission bit versus the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eff bit</font>

208
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,230
fixed bit and so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very first bit</font>

209
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,040
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this of the foot new format tells</font>

210
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,580
whether or not it's a retransmission

211
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:58,480
format or<font color="#E5E5E5"> effect format so it makes it</font>

212
00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:03,160
easier for parsers where there's also a

213
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,410
note now about the largest mask possible

214
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,750
so one of the one of the fact formats

215
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:10,209
allows you to specify a mask of up to

216
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,820
one hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and eight bits so you can</font>

217
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:15,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">protect this this packet this fact</font>

218
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,740
packet can be protecting up to 108

219
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,960
source packets before it and this mask

220
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:23,680
tells you which which of those packets

221
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:27,400
is protecting and there's a there's an

222
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,770
extension bit as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mass grows from 16</font>

223
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,780
bits to 32 bits to 64 bits there's an

224
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:34,420
extension bit on each one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those to</font>

225
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,800
let it let it grow and obviously you

226
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:40,030
don't need the extension bit on the very

227
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:42,040
last 64 bit version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the mask if we</font>

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever plan to have any future</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">remove that back a bit and have you know</font>

232
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:55,300
what one more one more sequence number

233
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:57,280
that you could cover so that was that's

234
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,140
a noise we just added as editors<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody</font>

235
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">would actually move it but if anyone has</font>

236
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,710
a strong opinion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it let us know if</font>

237
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,050
not we'll probably just go ahead and and

238
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:07,300
do that remove the note<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then remove</font>

239
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,550
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> remove the bit unless anyone objects</font>

240
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,160
to it and there's a lot of editorial

241
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:14,199
clean up in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other sections</font>

242
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:18,790
next slide please this is the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> format</font>

243
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:22,690
for sorry go down that guy think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

244
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:23,770
inclined to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say via a future extension</font>

245
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,830
would have to be something that you

246
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:29,380
would you know negotiate as a different

247
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:31,630
payload type parameter or something so

248
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can't just I don't see how any way</font>

249
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:37,030
that you could silently<font color="#CCCCCC"> ya know backward</font>

250
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,590
compatible well remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> the goal of</font>

251
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:41,079
this originally the goal of flex<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

252
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:43,570
originally was to have flexibility so

253
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:46,210
you didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to declare a bunch of</font>

254
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:47,550
new formats it was so you could you know

255
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,680
we originally want to be able to extend

256
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:52,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">adco points</font>

257
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,120
or reed-solomon and<font color="#CCCCCC"> raptor that wouldn't</font>

258
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:56,580
require new<font color="#CCCCCC"> pelo types and you could</font>

259
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,360
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know switch them indirectly now</font>

260
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,529
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to go ahead and</font>

261
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,480
separate drafts but we still may be

262
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:02,550
would have a way to you know figure out

263
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,750
an extensibility mechanism to<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

264
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,569
require bunch of new pelo types for

265
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:08,640
those things either so the goal is if we

266
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,589
ever wanted a mask bigger than then

267
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,649
what's currently defined there may be a

268
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:15,750
future draft that extends it look take

269
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:17,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rate yanking out the bit now you know</font>

270
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,510
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> close the door on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that honestly we</font>

271
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,589
don't see a need really to protect more

272
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:25,860
than 100 or so packets in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past</font>

273
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:27,000
that's already a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> large window you</font>

274
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,779
know you'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a pretty high</font>

275
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,630
rate video stream to make protecting

276
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:43,130
more than 100 previous packets you know

277
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:46,320
viable so I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> one forward please I</font>

278
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:48,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">compact it just on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous I mean</font>

279
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are using a CP for some very high</font>

280
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,470
rate video streams so if you talk to

281
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:55,020
them and just make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> they that</font>

282
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:56,190
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not interested in this yeah</font>

283
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:01,020
that's a good point there there are the

284
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:02,520
uncompressed the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cynthy yeah and the</font>

285
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:06,150
special people doing that commercially

286
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,650
know nowadays yeah I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a note to</font>

287
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,890
ask them about what they feel about

288
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:12,390
yeah a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those formats are for</font>

289
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:15,480
basically wired<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet kind of</font>

290
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:17,520
applications were<font color="#E5E5E5"> a minute they might be</font>

291
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:22,709
a blind fekr and expect any loss but

292
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:24,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll ask around and see what it's also</font>

293
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:27,810
worth noting that if if you do have a

294
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:30,270
need for enormous windows there is in

295
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:33,989
the currents back there is a facility

296
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:39,290
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to 64</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> K windows if you don't use</font>

297
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:42,150
the mask if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the row and column</font>

298
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:44,060
you can have up to 256 rose into n 56

299
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:46,380
columns so you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to a 64k</font>

300
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,649
window of packets that you're protecting

301
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:51,000
that's if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very regular fixed</font>

302
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:52,410
pattern and large video<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that would</font>

303
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,720
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very regular fixed pattern the</font>

304
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:56,370
mask is<font color="#E5E5E5"> more for flexible video and</font>

305
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,589
coatings<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the only one protect</font>

306
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,480
certain packets because some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

307
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:02,380
be disposable so you had a you know more

308
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,839
pretty complicated

309
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:07,700
video video frame structure of

310
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,780
disposable frames and then less

311
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,490
important frames and things like that

312
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,560
certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of them that's</font>

313
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the so the mask is used for it's</font>

314
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:21,399
hard to see that growing much more than

315
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:25,819
100<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets in the past forward one side</font>

316
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:29,720
you going backward or forward oh it must

317
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:32,000
be air here because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah okay I</font>

318
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,670
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're real yeah so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

319
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,880
new this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the new format for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the full</font>

320
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:39,410
full mask when year when you're using

321
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,950
feck with the full mask the largest

322
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:45,200
possible mask you see just we're talking

323
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,940
about removing that that red k bit at

324
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,930
the end to give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred nine packets</font>

325
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,730
instead of hundred eight packets of

326
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:51,320
protection<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll go ahead and do that</font>

327
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:54,590
unless there's anybody that objects and

328
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,879
we've swapped we already swapped the the

329
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,870
first two bits so that the very first

330
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,980
but it tells you whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's a</font>

331
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:04,520
retransmission format or<font color="#E5E5E5"> effect format</font>

332
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:06,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright next slide so the only open</font>

333
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,730
issues removing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kay Binn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

334
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,620
we'll go ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do that unless</font>

335
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,390
anybody objects give it a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few days on</font>

336
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:14,419
the list to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure nobody has an</font>

337
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:17,200
issue with it and then the second major

338
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:19,550
thing is I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to hear nobody from</font>

339
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,200
from the chrome team I don't think is

340
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:25,010
here but they're the ones that

341
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,530
originally objected to having the

342
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:30,110
retransmission format be inefficient I

343
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:31,580
think we everybody supported having the

344
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:35,179
retransmission format isn't as an

345
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:37,510
optional thing built into flex effect so

346
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:40,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to negotiate r-tx separately</font>

347
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:42,110
so the support for having retransmission

348
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:43,870
but nobody liked it that it was so

349
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:46,189
inefficient that you know you're eating

350
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,350
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it was before it's like 20 or</font>

351
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,670
30 something bites<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mariana 12 the</font>

352
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,870
question is doing willing to be more

353
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,240
efficient than that are there people

354
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,969
that want to use this for audio where

355
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,770
you know the whole audio payload is only

356
00:18:54,970 --> 00:19:00,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 or 30 bites and 12 makes a big</font>

357
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:01,850
difference so like to hear from anyone

358
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">that has an opinion on that and I'm</font>

359
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,780
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ask directly to the chrome</font>

360
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:09,950
team what their what their position is

361
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:11,840
on the current size<font color="#CCCCCC"> Donal ex I mean I</font>

362
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:14,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">would argue that you know we're not</font>

363
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,629
obsolete in 4588 right so now we're not

364
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">upset if people</font>

365
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,380
use for you radiate they still count we

366
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,790
want to practically obsolete it what we

367
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,890
want we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to obviously it through</font>

368
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:25,050
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that is the facto not</font>

369
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:26,370
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jackson this overhead you know</font>

370
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:34,770
what about maybe eight is still there

371
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:40,020
with all<font color="#E5E5E5"> tetex so yea yea sorry I'm</font>

372
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:41,550
Bernardo Bubba set says I do think there

373
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,860
is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> application to audio since flex</font>

374
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:46,830
track is better than<font color="#CCCCCC"> oppas internal</font>

375
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:51,840
effect for example the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Opus internal</font>

376
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:54,360
 is good for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> low rate voice man</font>

377
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,010
streams but if you at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> subway you're</font>

378
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,810
going to need higher you're going to

379
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:00,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">need higher level effect you're going to</font>

380
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:01,620
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside fact for it for that so if</font>

381
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,450
you're using opus for music streaming or

382
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:06,750
something if I want something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like flex</font>

383
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:13,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">vac just for voice it's probably just as</font>

384
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:14,370
good to use in band opens in band but

385
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:17,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll probably will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pie float a</font>

386
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,689
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas for optimizing the</font>

387
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,490
retransmission format on the list and

388
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,230
see if anybody has an opinion either way

389
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:25,620
again like I said the trade-off<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

390
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:27,150
basically flexibility for efficiency you

391
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,649
know as we as we try to squeeze it down

392
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:30,480
it's going to reduce some of the

393
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,700
flexibility that that the returns we

394
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,950
should format has yet to fix the you

395
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,290
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh some fields to be negotiating</font>

396
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:40,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">stb versus versus dynamic and things</font>

397
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:42,510
like that there's a more editorial work

398
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,680
that needs to be done in some of the

399
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,580
other sections there's a lot of stuff

400
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">that still needs to be cleaned up</font>

401
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:51,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially in the registrations and</font>

402
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,860
after that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more no more</font>

403
00:20:51,360 --> 00:21:01,469
other issues and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were ready</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for last</font>

404
00:20:52,860 --> 00:21:03,719
call any other comments I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Colin</font>

405
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,760
it's just one editorial thing you've got

406
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,310
a bunch of fields named things like PX

407
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">MCC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so on which which is the same</font>

408
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:12,690
names as the fields in the RTP header<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

409
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,580
there's any way of renaming them to

410
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,770
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> which doesn't match those it</font>

411
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,179
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it easier to follow the lower</font>

412
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:23,490
case if we sort them all the lower case

413
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:25,050
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something okay yeah is all confusing</font>

414
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,450
some someone actually asked me you know

415
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:29,120
they look<font color="#E5E5E5"> they saw the format they were</font>

416
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,160
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking was the RTP header</font>

417
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,809
and that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the payload so um</font>

418
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,340
you're right it is a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> confusing</font>

419
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:38,210
when you look at it looks directly like

420
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:40,970
an hour RTP header so we'll we'll do

421
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,770
some renaming there maybe we'll slap<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

422
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,630
full RTP header above it too so that

423
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:47,200
it's clear that there's both in RTP

424
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:52,880
header and effect payload header

425
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:56,510
sandwich together just who read<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

426
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,210
document thing can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise your hand</font>

427
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:01,670

00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:08,330
we want to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a class collar so I</font>

430
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:09,770
just 125 but because this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the was a</font>

433
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:23,510
I hope that at least will do will do

<font color="#E5E5E5">working class call off to this revision</font>

but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people will do a review</font>

436
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,679
for that and we're also working

437
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,510
implementing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this so we're working</font>

438
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:34,790
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to see if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can get into</font>

439
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:40,720
some some beta versions of browsers to

440
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:58,820
see how it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good thanks um</font>

441
00:22:40,720 --> 00:23:01,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">next one is the hess alright nice to</font>

442

meet you<font color="#E5E5E5"> very well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm away and Marvin's</font>

443
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:08,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">minors name this drops this drop talks</font>

444
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:11,330
about how to be pelo from that for HTTP

445
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:14,090
adaptive streaming actually this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

446
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:17,419
second version of this trap we<font color="#E5E5E5"> present</font>

447
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:20,659
this drop last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time in burling and since</font>

448
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:23,690
then we have revised our idea and to

449
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:27,200
make it more to make a clearer so<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

450
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:29,330
place what we see is a little bit into

451
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,420
the background what we see is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paid</font>

452
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:35,720
video is becoming a revenue driver for

453
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:39,290
operators so and you see that operators

454
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:42,310
have already had this excellent

455
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:46,570
excellent the video delivery platform

456
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:50,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">IPTV network with a lot of features like</font>

the quality of experience to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

460
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:02,440

461
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:06,310
adaptive streaming technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font>

462
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:10,420
this management<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP TV network to bring</font>

463
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:14,100
more contents to the operators and to

464
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:19,230
help them simplify their the operations

465
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:22,659
so this please so progress<font color="#CCCCCC"> since last</font>

466
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:25,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting we have proposed our</font>

467
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:28,930
architecture work in the broadband

<font color="#CCCCCC">foreign oh sorry a typo in the broadband</font>

469
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:38,230
Thorin and we have revised our idea we

470
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:41,980
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> update the architecture use now</font>

471
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:44,770
using the drug to reflect our new idea

472
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:47,410
and we have some updates to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fields</font>

473
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:51,610
in the payload format which<font color="#CCCCCC"> will i will</font>

474
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:54,730
mention later yes please so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

475
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:59,530
the proposed a catcher the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font>

476
00:24:54,730 --> 00:25:03,820
the multicast gateway it works kind of

477
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:06,820
like a LED clam and pose this that you

478
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:11,470
objective stream streams around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> otd</font>

479
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:16,960
server and convert each of the streams

480
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:21,610
into a multicast group so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also does</font>

481
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:25,840
the it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also fits the media segments into</font>

482
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:28,090
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> riv packets so from the multicast</font>

483
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,389
gateway it passed down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> marcus</font>

484
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:35,580
streams down maybe further into the home

485
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:39,880
at at home we have the we can use the

486
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:44,010
traditional setup set-top box to receive

487
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:47,580
the multicast stream or we can deploy

488
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:52,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">a.m</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mark a stream cast</font>

489
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:55,460
acting as a RB translator to convert the

490
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:58,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">mod cast to unicast</font>

491
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:01,250
to some device that does not support

492
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:05,779
multicast directory so the whole thing

493
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:09,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this a catcher is them is where do</font>

494
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:14,330
we think the traders are made we believe

495
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:18,408
that that video that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is life and of high</font>

496
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:21,230
quality will bring more public to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

497
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:24,559
operators so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we hold our captures the</font>

498
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:28,789
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> trade-offs are made for life video</font>

499
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:33,260
of high quality of example a 4k<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ultra</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">High Definition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we won't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be on so we</font>

501
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:39,408
want the multi-mode cast gateway to be

502
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:42,380
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possible you know it may</font>

503
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:45,770
has a lot of processing to the video

504
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:48,080
contents but we need to ensure it to be

505
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:51,679
low delay for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lac content and to</font>

506
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:55,460
have high throughput for high-resolution

507
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:59,630
video so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they might require some updates</font>

508
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:02,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the click to the receivers at home</font>

509
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:05,570
clanks they may need to update their

510
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:11,500
software to support this new arm okapi

511
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:15,049
formats<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's please so why has</font>

512
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:17,149
over rdp why are a new format new

513
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:20,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">payload format as I mentioned we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

514
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:23,120
the multicast gateway to be as the most

515
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:29,178
possible suppose the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Armani Cascadia we</font>

516
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:32,840
just just just retrieves the manifest

517
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:37,370
files for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example their dash media</font>

518
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:42,370
presentation or the HS the the manifest

519
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:46,010
file four hrs it only passes those

520
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:51,739
manifest files and take out of the media

521
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:55,309
segments and and cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuts and fix those</font>

522
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:59,570
media signals into a TV packets that's

523
00:27:55,309 --> 00:28:04,700
the very simple possessing on that just

524
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:06,809
cut and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> retrieve cut and forward we</font>

525
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:13,590
want to be like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

526
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:18,120
so the the the arm not using<font color="#E5E5E5"> our to be</font>

527
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:22,559
existing RTP payload formats of course

528
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:26,729
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> present some Poppins first um you</font>

529
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:29,490
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the existing a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DBMS may already be</font>

530
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:33,240
supported by clowns so we might need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

531
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:36,600
update the clowns and existing body<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:39,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">paleo formats may require the multicast</font>

533

00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:46,529
payload format to pass the data of the

535
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:50,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">media segments so that is I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is too</font>

536
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:58,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">much in the processing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so nested</font>

537
00:28:50,669 --> 00:29:01,950
please so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> EP had a no change</font>

538
00:28:58,409 --> 00:29:05,249
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two to use of a DP had a since</font>

539
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:07,649
last draft we have the mac abide to

540
00:29:05,249 --> 00:29:10,409
engage the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last fragment of a media</font>

541
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:14,239
segment conventionally we have the

542
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:18,240
payload type we have the sequence number

543
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:22,279
incremented / rdb packets what's tricky

544
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:26,909
is about the field is the is a time step

545
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:30,929
actually we set the time step / media

546
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:35,759
segment so which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll show you a diagram</font>

547
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:40,440
nest nest slice so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a example of</font>

548
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:43,679
how of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pectin station I mean I if</font>

549
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:49,110
you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the has media segment one it</font>

550
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:51,960
has the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time step of 1099 two three four</font>

551
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:53,699
so it's divided into two<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of eight</font>

552
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:57,419
packets the two out of eight packets

553
00:29:53,700 --> 00:30:00,649
will share the same time stabbed but

554
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:03,720
each individual rd Bacchus will have

555
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:06,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">indepent distinct this sequence number</font>

556
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:11,190
and the sequence number will grow across

557
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:14,549
multiple RTP packets like that's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> text</font>

558
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:16,759
like those packets for the second

559
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:16,759
segment

560
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:24,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so nessa please oh this is a the</font>

561
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:28,379
RTP payload format what we proposed so

562
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:33,039
we have the fragment bit you I'll are

563
00:30:28,379 --> 00:30:36,248
like the inning last dropped what has

564
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:40,600
what have been changed is the we added

565
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:45,429
an offset field in the impaler format to

566
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:49,059
help the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client to relate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fat man to</font>

567
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:51,519
the media segment and we have removed

568
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:53,049
the type type field there used to be a

569
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:56,980
type field to indicate whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

570
00:30:53,049 --> 00:31:04,059

multiplex those kind of information into

considerations we need to fit<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

583
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:49,149
mostly I just want one slide back

584
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:50,769
question on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so you removed you said</font>

585
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:52,570
you removed the multiplexing of some

586
00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:54,700
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you remove the multiplexing of</font>

587
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:56,830
the meta information of the container

588
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,499
but you're still but the media segments

589
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:00,939
themselves are still multiplexed

590
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:03,489
audio/video subtitle whatever whatever

591
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:05,289
tracks the container had multiplex

592
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:09,609
together in each media segment right

593
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:12,789
right okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and if it's gets because</font>

594
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:15,340
um because we think then manifest files

595
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:18,220
Oh something on the initial information

596
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:21,970
they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> they need more reliable muse to</font>

597
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:25,179
with reliable methods to deliver so we

598
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:27,159
don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh-huh and just curious in</font>

599
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:30,429
your overall architecture is anything

600
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:32,950
actually going to terminate this RTP

601
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:35,379
and render it or all of these boxes that

602
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:37,779
are terminating this this RTP are going

603
00:32:35,379 --> 00:32:40,600
to forward it anyway as as something

604
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:44,649
else not as multiplexed audio video /

605
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:48,428
RTP I think I think okay either rendered

606
00:32:44,649 --> 00:32:52,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">if if the device</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has the that the</font>

607
00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:55,659
capability or at campo at to like them

608
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:57,759
to any devices back to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> film or so</font>

609
00:32:55,659 --> 00:33:03,009
the question is what is the payload

610
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:05,139
inside the the the RTP packet what is

611
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:10,059
the payload it's it's not video notes

612
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:12,969
it's dish or it's this format or its

613
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:14,980
ain't dash from a taiaha it's a segment

614
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:16,629
right it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is a yeah yeahs segment</font>

615
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,309
multiplexed who knows what just a bunch

616
00:33:16,629 --> 00:33:20,439
of tracks maybe are they may be video

617
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:24,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe subtitle maybe yeah javascript</font>

618
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:27,070
truth yes arbitrary relies on the counts

619
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:29,320
too<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that where I was going</font>

620
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,759
was if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't expect receivers of</font>

621
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,830
this arts pedia to be the ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

622
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:34,029
actually render the media they just

623
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:36,009
can't afford it long as to something

624
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:39,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">else then why even bother</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with our tepee</font>

625
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:42,549
why not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just multicast this you know</font>

626
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:45,879
directly as as the segment you know over

627
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:48,549
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> over straight UD</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Pearson thing</font>

628
00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:49,899
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTP add to the mix here if the</font>

629
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:51,519
receiver<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that is not actually going</font>

630
00:33:49,899 --> 00:33:57,668
to render it or time sync it or anything

631
00:33:51,519 --> 00:34:00,059
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you sound oh yes igt had</font>

632
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:03,369
some of the fears in the RB feeder

633
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:05,799
Heather<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe he'll away we need that I</font>

634
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:08,230
mean RTP is a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than an</font>

635
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:10,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">entrant protocol you you can do faq you</font>

636
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:12,699
can do retransmission<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do it you</font>

637
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:14,918
can use the whole infrastructure of all

638
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:17,558
of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> little support thingies where</font>

639
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:22,328
their sake yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure whether</font>

640
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:23,440
it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea but I mean RTP is there</font>

641
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:26,470
for a reason and the reason it's not

642
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">only that to provide multiplexing of</font>

643
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:34,239
different pelo types it since that's

644
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:36,549
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay compaq is here i mean i agree</font>

645
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:39,098
me that the reason for using RTP here is

646
00:34:36,549 --> 00:34:42,259
that you'd want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to render it and you use</font>

647
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:54,139
the timing information right

648
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:56,510
okay so um the fragmentation okay we

649
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:58,460
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two ways for fragmentation wise</font>

650
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:02,270
quite a straightforward we can just cut

651
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:05,090
the media segments without without

652
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:07,730
concern too much about what's inside we

653
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:12,140
just cut it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in to fit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the other</font>

654
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:14,390
packets so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this way arm it's more or</font>

655
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:17,089
less it's less resilient to pack a loss

656
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:19,819
because one loss of this fragment could

657
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:23,630
lead to the whole media segment antico

658
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:26,150
table maybe we can let the multicast

659
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:30,170
gateway to do it in a more intelligent

660
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:33,340
way there's some there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are several ways</font>

661
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:36,680
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it if the if the media format</font>

662
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:39,740
carrying a half segment is very simple

663
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:42,799
house maybe has a fixed length we can

664
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:45,560
cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just with them we can cut it by</font>

665
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:49,460
offset so is a quite simple operation or

666
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:51,950
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> media presentation the manifest</font>

667
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:58,070
files can provide some hangs are where

668
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:59,990
the next where the next point is so the

669
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:02,900
multicast gateway can cut them in a

670
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:05,779
sickness<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 2k we packed the media</font>

671
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:09,620
segments into smaller pieces to make the

672
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:13,040
each individual pieces Dakota power so

673
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:17,350
this in this way it may require more

674
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,350
processing for the multicast gateway

675
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:24,380
maybe more configurations for the

676
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:26,780
multicast gateway but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is is</font>

677
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:31,250
more resilient for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mod</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is more</font>

678
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:33,430
resilient to to the packet loss<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

679
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:36,770
this is trade-off to be made between the

680
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:41,299
balance is to balance the packet loss

681
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:45,080
and and the complexity in the multicast

682
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:49,940
gateway which needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take care of when</font>

683
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:54,730
we implement this<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so next</font>

684
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:54,730
slide that's next<font color="#CCCCCC"> please</font>

685
00:36:56,289 --> 00:37:04,940
next place so so any comments oh just

686
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:09,230
would like to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have any</font>

687
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:12,559
comments or suggestions or if this idea

688
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:24,650
is good enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be to call for the VG</font>

689
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:33,910
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> WG adoption yeah so first of all did</font>

690
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:33,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody read the document the draft okay</font>

691
00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:47,359
so um<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this is this is a payload</font>

692
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:49,700
format so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is I would like</font>

693
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:52,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask for adoption this is a working</font>

694
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:55,189
group document for the RTP payload

695
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:57,200
format based on also that this being

696
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,819
done in also they work for the

697
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,640
architecture and the solution is done in

698
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:03,200
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> body not in the ITF so</font>

699
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually they will need some payload</font>

700
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:11,720
format to to describe it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a solution</font>

701
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:14,569
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is do do is that who</font>

702
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:18,140
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to who's there for adopting</font>

703
00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:23,089
this is a working group as to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on</font>

704
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:26,420
this payload as a as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> CIA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> payload</font>

705
00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:28,460
working yes Ben Ben Campbell I didn't

706
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,950
see behind me on the number of reasons

707
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:32,930
but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> gather from the unhappy noise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

708
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:34,848
it wasn't very many are you ready to

709
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:37,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">make that call or would you like to like</font>

710
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:39,170
try to encourage my alibi also i'll try

711
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,730
out some day Lisa last words on the list

712
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:42,710
or the first one I'd get here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

713
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:44,510
we won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a decision only on what's</font>

714
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:45,980
here I just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see what's here and</font>

715
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:49,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll also go to the list and ask for</font>

716
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:51,650
people that to read them to provide the

717
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:53,569
the view about adopting<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

718
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:56,180
milestone<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the working group so how</font>

719
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:57,940
many hands did you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see I see I saw for</font>

720
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:00,940
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's more than I thought</font>

721
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,940
me

722
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:13,220
sir<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list like</font>

723
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:14,660
we saw i saw that was a sub<font color="#E5E5E5"> for hands</font>

724
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,519
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> raise when i asked the question</font>

725
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:21,379
and we'll go to the list to ask before

726
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:26,180
adopting this is working<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay</font>

727
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:27,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mosin any one final</font>

728
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:30,109
question I know there's multiple

729
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:32,210
variants of you know different OTT

730
00:39:30,109 --> 00:39:36,140
containers do you plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> to support all of</font>

731
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:40,730
them we plan to support you know all

732
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:45,049
variants of dash segments<font color="#E5E5E5"> HLS segments</font>

733
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:48,829
or anything like that all right actually

734
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:53,900
in temp to split the major ldt

735
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:57,230
technologies dash hrs that what we see

736
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:59,599
is the convergence in the in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> HDTV</font>

737
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:03,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">adept captive streaming technologies</font>

738
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:06,289
maybe I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Besh will be the future</font>

739
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:10,308
open standard for all the we can't

740
00:40:06,289 --> 00:40:11,749
neglect a chair is different we got more

741
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:13,999
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand the question because</font>

742
00:40:11,749 --> 00:40:16,069
basically what they are packet as you

743
00:40:13,999 --> 00:40:18,288
can see of bits right doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

744
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:19,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter what those bits are right but I</font>

745
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:22,700
haven't read<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dark so I don't know</font>

746
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:24,558
but I assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you do some some some</font>

747
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,930
parsing of the container format and then

748
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:29,390
specifying how that extraction goes into

749
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:32,089
the RTP right you're extracting at least

750
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:34,129
timestamps black right and you're trying

751
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:36,109
to inspect boundaries<font color="#E5E5E5"> the credible</font>

752
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:41,210
boundaries in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the segments that is only</font>

753
00:40:36,109 --> 00:40:42,410
about the manifest files yeah yeah but

754
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:45,259
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> the manifests are different between</font>

755
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:49,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">between the classes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but that was the</font>

756
00:40:45,259 --> 00:40:50,690
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tues who spawned mompou</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Monaco</font>

757
00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:52,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">file my main question is whether or not</font>

758
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:54,319
you intend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support all the major OTT</font>

759
00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:56,119
streaming formats and I think the answer

760
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:59,180
was yes so that's that's encouraging I

761
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:01,099
think that's a good good approach yes

762
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:05,089
Tim Theriault<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mozilla if I understood</font>

763
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:07,430
correctly arm there is one time stamp /

764
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:08,960
entire dash media segment so it is not

765
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:11,328
parsing the container to pull out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

766
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,860
Konstanz for individual frames inside

767
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:15,450
one of those segments

768
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,770
and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get that from the</font>

769
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:24,299
manifest file without looking in the

770
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:26,880
container at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay thanks thanks</font>

771
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:29,580
thanks and I think this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

772
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:35,190
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> for payload so we'll see</font>

773
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:39,390
you the next idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of meeting if was the</font>
