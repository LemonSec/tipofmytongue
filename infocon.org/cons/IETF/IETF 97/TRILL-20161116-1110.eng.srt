to IPR disclosure rules and so forth

132
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:09,709
study that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the quality of the documents</font>

133
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:13,220
we produce which is really the<font color="#E5E5E5"> output of</font>

with my presentation on routine<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay one</font>

176
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:20,490
of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were looking at next</font>

177
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:22,470
is some of the data center stuff for

start with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Donald's king okay so uh</font>

180
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:34,860
thank you sure sure awfully it'll work

181
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:37,320
next slide please so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm Donnelly's it</font>

00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,880
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Huawei so trill has some</font>

183
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,310
communications protocols that it

184
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:46,439
standardizes and in particular there's

185
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:47,729
the loud<font color="#E5E5E5"> i get to the middle bit rate</font>

00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,770
them in a second but for these

187
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:52,079
communications protocols you don't

188
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:53,550
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in general whether the troll</font>

189
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,349
switches are locally in a controlled

190
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,449
environment or maybe they're far apart

191
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,620
and you have in secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> communication so</font>

192
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,770
you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to have some way of</font>

193
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:03,450
securing that and there's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of two</font>

194
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:05,880
aspects securing one is like the

195
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:08,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">format's of the packets and the</font>

196
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,899
encryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> algorithm is all kind of</font>

197
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,310
stuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is keying</font>

198
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:13,020
because it doesn't really matter how

199
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:16,619
good the other stuff is if you can't get

200
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:20,339
good secure secret keys to the end

201
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,690
points or insights<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to use by those</font>

202
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:25,640
algorithms then you still key don't have

203
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:28,920
security and modern criterion which is

204
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,630
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for so don't</font>

205
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,110
like strongly encouraged by the IETF

206
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:36,870
security area requires key negotiation

207
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:38,820
so that you don't keep using the same

208
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,170
key you don't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have manual</font>

209
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,690
configuration you can have manual

210
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,490
configured

211
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,990
an option but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really want a way</font>

212
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,330
where you automatically generate new

213
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:49,210
session<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys and so forth so you really</font>

214
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:54,370
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a reasonable way to do that</font>

215
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:58,540
sort of thing next slide so<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

216
00:16:54,370 --> 00:17:01,120
particular areas where<font color="#CCCCCC"> trill has some</font>

217
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,589
keying is Arbor channel messages which I

218
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,079
mentioned briefly earlier which are

219
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:07,420
typed to control messages between drill

220
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:09,639
switches and we also just getting the

221
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:12,100
trill over IP through so trill supports

222
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:15,760
IP encapsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the traffic between</font>

223
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:18,310
trill switches both the<font color="#CCCCCC"> trill control</font>

227
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ethernet but Ethernet already has its</font>

228
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:27,400
own kind of security stuff so it's

229
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:29,260
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly worried about the</font>

230
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:34,210
communications channels that trill has

231
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:35,680
specified so unicast is pretty easy so

232
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:38,440
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the session key to</font>

233
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,090
the endpoints and<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically people have</font>

234
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">already figured out how to do that kind</font>

235
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:47,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">of so the existing RFC on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Arbor</font>

236
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:50,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">channel's the extension 79 78 adding</font>

237

239
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:57,010
negotiation is great and similarly IP

240
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,929
draft says use<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ike v2 it has all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

241
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:03,640
modern stuff but this is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

242
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:05,620
point to point<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide so a multicast</font>

243
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,630
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> broadcasting's can be more efficient</font>

244
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:11,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it decreases link utilization</font>

245
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:13,510
and decreases port utilization it has

246
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:19,390
advantages but it's trickier for

247
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:22,200
security so arbic channel facility is

248
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:25,390
ways designed automatically supports

249
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,660
multi caster basically you with to all

250
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:30,130
the trill switches that have advertised

251
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,780
interest in a particular VLAN or fine

252
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,850
grained label so it's already has that

253
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,590
built into it I p of course has multi

254
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,360
has defined it's not always supported

255
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:40,000
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are certainly especially local</font>

256
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,919
networks which support<font color="#E5E5E5"> native IP</font>

257
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,080
multicast so in those cases you'd like

258
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,190
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to use those facilities you</font>

259
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,659
like to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to use them securely</font>

260
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:50,950
next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh so there's like different</font>

261
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,110
ways you can try to do multicast

262
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,460
security well first is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

263
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,560
multicast security

264
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:59,560
it's just you send multiple copies to

265
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,990
everybody thats Sarah unicast to is

266
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,240
where you distribute a secret key to all

267
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,880
the members of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the group they can use</font>

268
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,940
that to encrypt multicast or broadcast

269
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,830
and that's can be secure but the more

270
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,160
people that know the key you know this

271
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:16,949
slightly less secure and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> longer</font>

272
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,750
have any way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of telling</font>

273
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,940
cryptographically securing which of the

274
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,500
group members originated a message<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

275
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,600
they're all using the same key in the

276
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,370
group you can tell it came from somebody

277
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but you can't tell which so</font>

278
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:33,699
the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> then is which for to</font>

279
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:37,270
whether the added efficiency of

280
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,920
multicast is worth the small reduction

281
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,120
in security whether that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a small</font>

282
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,420
reduction I guess depends on your

283
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,010
security environment next slide there's

284
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,050
also possible to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use other kinds of</font>

285
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:48,970
security like public key security or

286
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody has a different key you use</font>

287
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,820
public key and everything the problem

288
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,460
with that is it's more it's

289
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:57,580
computationally less efficient I mean

290
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:00,370
like many orders of magnitude could be

291
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,780
10,000 times as inefficient so may not

292
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,610
be practical and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:07,210
more complicated exotic ways of doing

294
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:10,300
things which are not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pride too</font>

295
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:12,010
widely deployed some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

296
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:15,460
standardized but it's not widely

297
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:17,500
deployed next slide so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the idea is</font>

298
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,760
for trill which you obviously do if you

299
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,250
have point-to-point security you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:24,670
obviously do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the serial unicast is to</font>

301
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:26,470
extend it to type 2 so if you have a

00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:28,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">network where the slight reduction in</font>

303
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,970
security where you can't tell who

304
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:32,440
originated a<font color="#CCCCCC"> message</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a problem then</font>

305
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:36,610
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> always fall back to Syria</font>

306
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:41,410
unicast which will be secure until next

307
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:44,080
one so the draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's like troll group</font>

308
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:46,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">keying specifies a way to do to securely</font>

309
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,010
distribute a key from one group member

310
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:51,190
to the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> group members so they all</font>

311
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:53,560
have the same key can use it and there

312
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:55,870
be ideas that be a companion graft<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

313
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,149
would define the details of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

314
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,949
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Trillo over IP and the details</font>

315
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,920
of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our channels and</font>

316
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,450
it's for the facility the group<font color="#E5E5E5"> king</font>

317
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,200
facility is designed so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could tailor</font>

318
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,200
it for other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things too</font>

319
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:16,060
so it's sort of a generic way to do

320
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:17,680
things next slide so it uses it assumes

321
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,540
you already have pairwise keying set up

322
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,250
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can be doing broadcasts or</font>

323
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,139
multicasts you<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost always have</font>

324
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,840
unicast traffic between at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

325
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">airs anyway so if you set up</font>

326
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,189
point-to-point security you now have a

327
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:33,070
secure way to communicate and you can

328
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:35,020
use that for distributing the key so in

329
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:37,540
fact the group key is effectively

330
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,310
serially unicast to the members of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

331
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:42,250
group this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually very similar to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the way why fire 802 11 does security it</font>

has a group key for Wi-Fi a multicast

334
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:49,420
and things like that and the access

335
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:53,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">points really unique asset to the</font>

00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:55,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">stations so that's very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> similar and it</font>

says he assumes there'll be some details

338
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,840
set up for each particular use in

339
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:01,570
particular how to tell which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

340
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,689
designated group member to originate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

341
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:06,970

342
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,710
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send something over IP is a</font>

343
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,360
little different from sending it over an

345
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:16,540
headers and trailers next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide and it</font>

346
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,980
has key identifier so you can have

347
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,409
multiple keys outstanding you can

348
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,940
distribute a new key and then send out a

349
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:26,740
command to tell everybody to roll<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

350
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:28,330
to that new key so forth so I already

351
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,860
have covered the last note there next

352
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,929
slide I don't want to take too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much time</font>

353
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:34,389
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we started a bit late so this is</font>

354
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:36,450
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> very generally what these</font>

355
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:40,720
messages in this group<font color="#CCCCCC"> keating look like</font>

356
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:42,910
they have an inner container so to speak

357
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,550
which uses the AES key rabbi probably

358
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:48,370
should have put the RFC here AES key<font color="#CCCCCC"> rap</font>

359
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:51,700
is up there's an RC which specifies it

360
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:53,800
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually really specified by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nist in</font>

361
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:57,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">u.s. government but it's a way of a</font>

362
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:59,770
multiple encryption using AES and then

363
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,850
you put as much as you can in there

364
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that's the sort of the strongest</font>

365
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,389
protection and then you have an outer

366
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:06,520
container and you put a minimal amount

367
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,020
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> outer part so you can recognize</font>

368
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:12,160
what this message is about what's going

369
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:13,750
on and that's secured using this point

370
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">to point security you already have set</font>

371
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,710
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this leverages existing</font>

372
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,530
point-to-point security so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort</font>

373
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,430
of this orange container on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the outside</font>

374
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:24,310
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> details of course we're in</font>

375
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:28,210
the draft which is draft name is in this

376
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:30,370
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

377
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:32,230
a five-member group so you have one

378
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:34,050
designated node elected to determine in

379
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,280
some way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it basically sends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Keys</font>

380
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:39,550
generates a key and sends it to

381
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:41,470
everybody and then all these five each

382
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,030
of them could originate a message either

383
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:45,820
to all the members of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the group or some</font>

384
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:50,470
multicast subset or whatever so that's

385
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:52,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">it any questions sorry if I rushed a bit</font>

386
00:23:50,470 --> 00:24:00,250
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to hopefully have explained</font>

387
00:23:52,270 --> 00:24:03,850
yeah eagerly so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is crooking a</font>

388
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:06,730
protocol hooked<font color="#CCCCCC"> tutor like the member</font>

389
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:08,560
membership update for example there's a

390
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,810
new member joining to the group and

391
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,610
leaving all kind of yeah this is

392
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:14,830
material in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> if a new member joins</font>

393
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:17,469
the group that's generally not a problem

394
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:20,649
because as soon as they have secure

395
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:22,090
communication to the designated node

396
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,670
then the designated mode can give them

397
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:27,429
the current key and maybe any future

398
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:28,930
keys that it wants and then that new

399
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,600
member<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the group can start receiving</font>

400
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:33,850
and transmitting fine when remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

401
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,250
group leaves in general what you should

402
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:37,990
do is rekey the remaining<font color="#CCCCCC"> members</font>

403
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,700
because this person is no longer

404
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,350
remember the group and you know the

405
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,360
draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> bait since its kind of intended to</font>

406
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:45,669
be a general draft it says that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

407
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,219
should do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but sometimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have</font>

408
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:49,960
a highly dynamic group with members

409
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,480
entering and leaving all the time it may

410
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,980
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> impractical to rekey that often so</font>

411
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,850
you really have to make a judgment

412
00:24:53,980 --> 00:25:03,490
depending on the application oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

413
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:07,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">think and so certainly anybody who wants</font>

414
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:11,200
to review the<font color="#CCCCCC"> drafts and comment will be</font>

415
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:13,840
welcome to do so and and actually for

416
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,700
this draft if you get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> chance guys it</font>

417
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,070
would be useful to take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it</font>

418
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll try to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it this next</font>

419
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:22,240
week Donald annum go through it keep

420
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,590
rekeying is important because when

421
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,390
they're in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the data center</font>

422
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:29,379
stuff or when you're in the middle of

423
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:32,290
deployments having the group key secure

424
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:33,500
and Donald's process is pretty effective

425
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:36,080
so

426
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,300
because a lot of data center trafficked

427
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,310
or a lot of land traffic can get

428
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:44,120
attacked and this will will provide

429
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:45,649
quick Ricky yeah it probably would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

430
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,510
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good idea for me to present to</font>

431
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:49,250
presented this to sag at this meeting I

432
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,770
could maybe do that next meeting if

433
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:54,860
anyone is in sac on Friday that's

434
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:56,570
normally Thursday afternoon<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

435
00:25:54,860 --> 00:26:01,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good I mean I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see if they</font>

436
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:03,760
have any time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh it's one of the</font>

437
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:07,669
point out<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what it was okay</font>

438
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:12,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay today if so I'm gonna go through</font>

439
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:14,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter changes um our focus has</font>

440
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:19,940
been from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ad to try to get things</font>

441
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:22,399
that make trill deployed what's missing

442
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:25,370
so remember that's what happened so we

443
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,530
done current<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter and thanks to</font>

444
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:31,010
Donald and and John and all of you were

445
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:32,870
making really good progress on it I

446
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:35,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">think I'm always impressed with this</font>

447
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:37,159
working group is we click through things

448
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:41,330
fairly quickly and people respond<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

449
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:44,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">mail with with good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reviews so we're</font>

450
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:47,210
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of down to the ARP reduction draft</font>

451
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:50,479
which we've gone through twice and the

452
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:52,190
directory mechanisms are about there so

453
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,460
we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of review process and</font>

454
00:26:52,190 --> 00:27:00,440
we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this drill Suter wires and</font>

455
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:02,600
we've gone to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-level and multi</font>

456
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,150
topology so a lot of our initial work is

457
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,129
done but standardization for

458
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:10,010
interoperability is getting the reviews

459
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:13,790
all the way through now the intercampus

460
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:16,180
control plane stuff is pending and we've

461
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:18,889
been doing the security analysis

462
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:22,070
interoperability has been requested by

463
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:25,310
80s to move to web so we'll try to keep

464
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:27,470
getting stuff so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question that we're</font>

465
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:33,860
sort of looking is we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding ecn</font>

466
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:36,980
support and transparent mode to provide

467
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:39,169
better input inside of the data centers

468
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,420
it'd be good to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

469
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:43,600
matters two deployments you're working

470
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:47,280
with and so we'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like some feedback</font>

471
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,990
because we will do a final<font color="#E5E5E5"> call</font>

472
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:54,120
within a couple weeks for the charter

473
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:56,400
change and then what we've got as to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

474
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:00,209
specific is we've added<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ecn will</font>

475
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:03,630
supply supply extensions for more

476
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:10,800
transparent connections and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will specify</font>

477
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:13,440
to have more transparent mode the and

478
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:17,010
then we'll specify to support other

479
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:20,910
payloads such as IP so please look at it

480
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:23,370
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll change the name please look at</font>

481
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:25,740
it will post this new charter in a

482
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:27,750
couple weeks we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get through</font>

483
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,390
all of our other reviews so we can just

484
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:33,930
clear our docket some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> its stuck with</font>

485
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:36,090
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad but she sort of overloaded for a</font>

486
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:43,740
little bit while she was ill so I think

487
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:49,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's it do you want to will it be</font>

488
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:52,940
presented remotely yes now because I'm

489
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:54,960
gonna have to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your indulgence</font>

490
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,180
this is the first time I've had to

491
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,640
working groups where I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to appear at</font>

492
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:01,860
the same time as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a chair so I will go</font>

493
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">out for about five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or ten minutes and</font>

494
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,090
leave Donald with it Donald<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

495
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">graciously agreed to take care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

496
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:14,730
remote presentation do we have a remote

497
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:19,940
presenter on yes he's online our prime X

498
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:19,940
Warren so let's see I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

499
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:26,969
oh one<font color="#E5E5E5"> other question uh do we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

500
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:32,700
jabber straw here actually we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

501
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:34,980
have done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that earlier yeah I we can do</font>

502
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,540
minutes easily enough from the audio but

503
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,550
is there anybody in the Java room for

504
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:41,760
troll useful to have somebody there to

505
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:43,970
monitor things well actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do</font>

506
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,970
that

507
00:29:47,330 --> 00:30:02,169
ah let's see here so what I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

508
00:29:52,910 --> 00:30:02,170
is one moment here

509
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:24,200
industry listen yesterday well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

510
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,200
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> ping</font>

511
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,679
Oh

512
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:39,309
one

513
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:24,080
I'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I guess what i want to</font>

514
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:31,690
do here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i push this button does</font>

515
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:31,689
that actually do anything to me dekho um

516
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:47,330
so I believe if we want to get me dekho

517
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:49,129
to have the remote presenter being

518
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:52,870
displayed I don't know if he needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

519
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything to to do that</font>

520
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:10,260
you see

521
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:34,428
so it's here well anyway um you should

522
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,428
figure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

523
00:32:50,899 --> 00:33:02,518
type ah ok oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can you yes</font>

524
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:09,149
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear you now okay okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and let me</font>

525
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:11,999
help young<font color="#E5E5E5"> fella start or as some</font>

526
00:33:09,149 --> 00:33:13,258
doesn't seem to be too bad we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

527
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:15,960
actually see<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not sure if you're</font>

528
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:24,570
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do video but yeah you</font>

529
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:29,460
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to do okay ah there</font>

530
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:32,279
you are excellent ok so i guess i can

531
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:35,519
get started<font color="#E5E5E5"> um basically this this drug</font>

532
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:37,379
deals with you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> default whole</font>

533
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">tree construction rules can create</font>

534
00:33:37,379 --> 00:33:42,718
situations where for a particular node

535
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:45,450
the parent node might shift in certain

536
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:49,589
situations so it tries to offer two

537
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:52,109
solutions for that and basically we can

538
00:33:49,589 --> 00:33:54,320
go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> those my name is Ram Kumar</font>

539
00:33:52,109 --> 00:34:03,210
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I work for Birkett communications</font>

540
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:06,239
next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> please these are right so so</font>

541
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:08,579
then the subsequent slides will

542
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:11,730
basically give a picture which explains

543
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:13,649
what the problem is but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basic the truths</font>

544
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:15,690
tree construction rules can create

545
00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:17,308
situations where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the parent</font>

546
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:19,829
node for a particular child node will

547
00:34:17,309 --> 00:34:21,510
shift during Reconstruction even if

548
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:24,270
there is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> apparent change in the pit</font>

549
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:27,569
the the links or the availability of the

550
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:29,309
parent so this draft has a it proposes

551
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:32,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">two different solutions to address that</font>

552
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:36,210
and we can go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the logic of each</font>

553
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:38,010
of those and so the motivation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

554
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,869
was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I was aware of</font>

555
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:42,750
situations where people where customers

556
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:46,289
were impacted by this and we're looking

557
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:49,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">for ways to solve it so to that extent I</font>

558
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:52,260
mean basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> if if this is important</font>

559
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:57,139
enough then this weekend on request

560
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:57,139
adoption of this draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> please</font>

561
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:08,020
so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could skip to the next</font>

562
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:09,309
slide that's fine well yeah so it so the

563
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:12,819
problem basically comes down to this

564
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:15,190
this paragraph and this text in the draw

565
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:20,710
in the draft and with the correction in

566
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:22,869
7780 so if you have it can a node when

567
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:26,440
you're pulling the node into the SPF

568
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:28,500
tree if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the node has lesser p parents</font>

569
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:32,049
and you're constructing<font color="#CCCCCC"> three number j</font>

570
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,730
then the the rule basically mandates

571
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:36,880
that your parents election will be j

572
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:38,369
minus 1 mod p this will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the index of</font>

573
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">the parent where the parents are</font>

574
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:44,740
arranged in ascending order of seven

575
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:52,299
bite is i socked a tidy so next slide

576
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:55,930
please so this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> this log explains</font>

577
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:58,450
that situation so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see look at</font>

578
00:35:55,930 --> 00:36:02,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">this my new flow network on the top</font>

579
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:05,919
right of the slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered 32 and</font>

580
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:10,359
assume that node a is the is a root of

581
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,579
the tree so at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> uni at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the outset</font>

582
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:13,990
basically when a starts pulling in nodes

583
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:17,410
into the network it will immediately

584
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:18,939
pull in 1 2<font color="#CCCCCC"> & 3 so 1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 & 3 do not have a</font>

can be so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the links on a slide</font>

588
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:29,710
or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is showing in the right</font>

589
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:31,150

590
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:33,369
connected to each other and it's a it's

591
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:36,819
it's it's basically a spine leaf network

592
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:39,309
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traditional article</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at apology so</font>

593

594

597
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:53,589
discussion assume that all the links

598
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:54,939
have the same cost so the you know be

599
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:57,609
for example will be reachable at a

600
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:58,869
cumulative hop count of to see will also

601
00:36:57,609 --> 00:37:00,910
be reachable either hop count up to

602
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:02,950
regardless of which parent it is

603
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:09,009
selected<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether it's one two or three</font>

604
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:10,359
next slide please so so that is fine you

605
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:11,990
could initially start off with the trill

606
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:12,860
rule and

607
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:16,729
application on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous slide</font>

608
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:18,800
explained how r<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 node two were selected</font>

609
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:20,300
as the parent<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's basically</font>

610
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,160
because if you are if you could if you

611
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,590
look at one two and three order them<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

612
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,730
assume they are already inserted

613
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:31,700
ascending order of seven bike octet ID

614
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:33,500
the index that will be used for 3 to 4 B

615
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:36,230
and C they have three possible parents

616
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:40,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> treat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 so 2 minus 1 mod 3</font>

617
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:43,670
is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 mod 3 is 1 so the index of the</font>

618
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:45,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">selected parent will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to now and</font>

619
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:47,450
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> to as a parent for B</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and C</font>

620
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:50,959
in the previous slide I hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

621
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:53,330
clear from the links now now consider

622
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,420
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens if node one goes down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

623
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:58,069
when node one goes down the parent the

624
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,590
picture of the parent selection changes

625
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:02,619
so now B and C don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have three possible</font>

626
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:06,470
parents<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have two possible parents</font>

627
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:08,300
which are node 2 and node 3 they are in

628
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:11,240
ascending order they are arranged as

629
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:14,060
node to common node 3 node 2 at index<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0</font>

630
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,799
and note 3 our index<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 now you're in now</font>

631
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:19,730
you run your transparent selection rule

632
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:23,030
which says 3-1 mod number of parents so

633
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:26,450
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is 2-1 mod 2 in this case so that's</font>

634
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:29,420
one mod 2 that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 but now the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> node at</font>

635
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:32,210
index 1 is no longer mode to its node 3

636
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:35,210
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> be and cease parents shift from node</font>

637
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,950
2 to node 3 this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a this is</font>

638
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:39,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">unnecessary because in vowed to never</font>

639
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:41,359
went away it's it's healthy its links to

640
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:43,819
B<font color="#CCCCCC"> and C are healthy so there is no</font>

641
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:49,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason for B</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and C to change its parent</font>

642
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:50,570
so so the and this can cause some amount

643
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,100
of disruption in the network depending

644
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:54,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">on you know how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll strike</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your vlans</font>

645
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:56,540
and not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> from there you know just</font>

646
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:58,160
not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> just from the links themselves</font>

647
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:00,800
changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can be other other ways in</font>

648
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:06,529
which it more disruption is possible so

649
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:08,090
next slide please so the first approach

650
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:09,260
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft takes it gives two</font>

651
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:11,330
different solutions the first solution

652
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:16,040
is that you can use affinity sub tlv to

653
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:18,350
sell this so I mean innocent stated

654
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:21,290
simply basically the node that wants to

655
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:23,630
maintain<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current bindings sends out</font>

656
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:25,870
an affinity sub tlv naming the children

657
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:28,810
and that it wants to hold on

658
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:30,940
across the network change event they are

659
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:33,520
so if you go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous slide</font>

660
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:40,660
the mode actually you can go to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

661
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:44,940
slide that's fine if you know actually

662
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:48,310
skip to the diagram the following slide

663
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:50,230
yeah so in this case what happens is in

664
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:52,210
the same situation before node one goes

665
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:55,240
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> node two sends out an affinity sub</font>

666
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:56,980
tlv ought to all the nodes in the

667
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,379
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> as part of its router capability</font>

668
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:02,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">or multi to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> felicity router capability</font>

669
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:05,020
LVS and everybody knows that too wants

670
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:07,420
to bind to B<font color="#CCCCCC"> and C so the way this is</font>

671
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:10,360
framed in the draft is that you must

672
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:12,520
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a CLI option on node 2 stating that</font>

673
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:15,280
the operator wants this node to be

674
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,780
sticky for its children so the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> I at</font>

675
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,610
least<font color="#CCCCCC"> ionisation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> written the draft is</font>

676
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,770
that you have a loose loosely stated

677
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:23,890
stickiness in the sense that you don't

678
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:26,259
say no to has to have these children as

679
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:31,540
its sticky children you just say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

680
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:33,220
note<font color="#CCCCCC"> too sticky so and as so note to</font>

681
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,259
initially starts off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the publishing the</font>

682
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:37,750

<font color="#E5E5E5">graph talks about the first tree</font>

684

00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,000
and then subsequent ones using the

686
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,350

too but if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> laws banning the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

689
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:54,130
it works is that node<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 doesn't like try</font>

691
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:59,500
cases it just it disregards the to rule

692
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:01,800
it also disregards<font color="#E5E5E5"> affinity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oggy and</font>

696

700
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:19,779
for the same setup children it tries to

00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:22,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">hold on to them by say continuing to</font>

702
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:24,280
send out the affinity tlv if it reaches

703
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:26,020
a situation where it cannot send it it

704
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,060
can no longer be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the parent for those</font>

705
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:30,220
children or if the parent-child

706
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,810
relationship in words because some links

707
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,359
went down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> b and c are now pulling</font>

709
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:39,690

it and if there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> any if it is not</font>

713
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:51,450

715
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:59,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">please so the second approach deals with</font>

716
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,830
this little funky<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it uses a</font>

717
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:05,130
modified version of the SPF algorithms

718
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:06,779
where you are if you can pull out

719
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:09,750
multiple when you're pulling nodes in

720
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:13,320
from into the network into<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is SPF</font>

721
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:15,090
tree if you can pull multiple nodes if a

722
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:19,590
node can be pulled by multiple parents

723
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:21,960
at the same cost done it it allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

724
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:26,070
to insert a policy filter which allows

725
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:27,690
you to choose the node so now that's one

726
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:30,150
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it the second part of it is that</font>

727
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:32,640
what how<font color="#E5E5E5"> does this help you the previous</font>

728
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:36,690
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will make the policy filter</font>

729
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:39,029
choose the treat the parent that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had</font>

730
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:41,070
in the previous iteration<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the tree so</font>

731
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:44,430
in this case you everybody starts out

732
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:46,260
with chills default recomputation with

733
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:48,779
the truth default rules that were

734
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">arrested previously and as you move into</font>

735
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,280
successive as the tree<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets recalculated</font>

736
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:55,470
due to network events<font color="#E5E5E5"> you try to latch</font>

737
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,880
your policy filter to the previous

738
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:59,330
choice of parent that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had for this</font>

739
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,500
to the same child nodes so in this case

740
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:04,130
next slide please<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you can go to</font>

741
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture</font>

742
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:14,839
take the same situation with this

743
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:19,008
approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so the initial click</font>

744
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:20,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">construction happens you have initial</font>

745
00:43:19,009 --> 00:43:23,599
tree construction happens with default

746
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:26,288
mode or rules then later in subsequent

747
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,700
calculations when note goes down

748
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:31,160
everybody has access to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two</font>

749
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,569
looked like when no one was up now

750
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,368
they'll use that and feed that into

751
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:35,869
their policy filter and now with the

752
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:39,380
modified SPF algorithm when they

753
00:43:35,869 --> 00:43:41,210
construct the new tree the BNC will

754
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:42,470
automatically get pulled in through poo

755
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:44,240
because they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the previous</font>

756
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:47,240
snapshot because in the previous lecture

757
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:54,558
they were pulled in through<font color="#CCCCCC"> two so can</font>

758
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:56,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">you go back one slide please so but the</font>

759
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,640
challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> approach is that you</font>

760
00:43:56,509 --> 00:44:00,650
using something like a time latch and

761
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,288
basically this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening in a</font>

762
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:05,990
distributed fashion across all the all

763
00:44:03,289 --> 00:44:07,490
the nodes in the network so everybody

764
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:09,319
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to agree on what the previous</font>

765
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:12,140
snapshot looked like for them to for

766
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:13,670
this approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work successfully so in</font>

767
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:16,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">general that's a little bit hard to do</font>

768
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:17,990
but what what what you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> potentially</font>

769
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:20,529
do is leverage the fact that by the time

770
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:23,328
you download your routes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware</font>

771
00:44:20,529 --> 00:44:25,759
every node in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network has to agree</font>

772
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:27,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">on what the tree looks like so bad about</font>

773
00:44:25,759 --> 00:44:29,839
putting it near that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hardware download</font>

774
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:32,599
trigger and by dampening it sufficiently

775
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:34,339
you should be able to make this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work but</font>

776
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:38,990
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> then probably work best in like</font>

777
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:43,509
small and medium-sized networks so can

778
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:43,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">we skip to the slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next one</font>

779
00:44:45,009 --> 00:44:49,609
so between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trapezes I think approach</font>

780
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:51,410
is more preferable because it's much

781
00:44:49,609 --> 00:44:54,680
more predictable affinity<font color="#CCCCCC"> set tlv is</font>

782
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:58,399
well understood and you know i<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it's</font>

783
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:59,690
it's known to work the only

784
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,430
consideration being that if up if

785
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:03,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">somebody else has a patent on approach a</font>

786
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:05,839
then we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about it the</font>

787
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:10,038
nature<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these approaches has any as</font>

788
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:13,569
any IP are at brocade so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a where</font>

789
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:13,569
ever had any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

790
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:33,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so this is a important problem</font>

791
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:37,560
the I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only question I have</font>

792
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:40,810
really understand the least approach a

793
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:42,100
4gb seems a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> dependent what kind</font>

794
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:44,470
of policies you'd want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up in</font>

795
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:46,210
things but there is another draft

796
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:48,250
actually which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is called resilient trees</font>

797
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:51,040
which is aimed at a slightly different

798
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:54,220
problem not so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stability but</font>

799
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:57,970
rather rapid establishment of a tree

800
00:45:54,220 --> 00:46:00,160
after a failure and it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly</font>

801
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:04,299
long so i guess the only question<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

802
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:06,520
would be whether it can somehow also<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

803
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:10,360
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem that</font>

804
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:12,910
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about but so you might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

805
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:17,260
useful to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that draft so and</font>

806
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:24,060
strategy acrylic trees but<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I think</font>

807
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:26,410
I've gone through it my dear so um I

808
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,720
believe to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key i holding</font>

809
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:35,230
all together and you come out with two

810
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:37,660
trees<font color="#E5E5E5"> right this is oriented</font>

811
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:40,290
recipe implementation which<font color="#CCCCCC"> used a</font>

812
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:46,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">traditional SPF the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dijkstra algorithm</font>

813
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:49,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">yes so well at least we'll be good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

814
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:53,140
sure that let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> we adopt approach a</font>

815
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:55,029
for solution of the problem that you're

816
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:57,040
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about be good to make sure there</font>

817
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:59,320
was no conflict between that and the

818
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,970
thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> resilient trees or if there</font>

819
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,520
were then you need to comment to say

820
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:06,069
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that how to hula maybe</font>

821
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:10,090
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only use one of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'll</font>

822
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:11,320
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it on a night</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yep</font>

823
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:14,290
probably get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back on the list or</font>

824
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:18,330
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sure they'll be good thing</font>

825
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:18,330
to discuss on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list okay</font>

826
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:24,250
there i saw i guess i'm also cheering

827
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:39,760
here is anybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a comment on</font>

828
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:44,500
the presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll thank you for</font>

829
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:48,690
the presentation and i guess i can push

830
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,690
the red button here let's see

831
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,510
let's see we have

832
00:48:10,289 --> 00:48:14,959
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure how to get back to the</font>

833
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:28,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">agenda but the agenda really only had</font>

834
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:28,759
like one more slide well let's build

835
00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:45,739
here we go well also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to this</font>

836
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:03,630
we do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just I'm just going to</font>

837
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">very briefly go over the milestone</font>

838
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:08,430
situation we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have achieved more</font>

839
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:10,550
milestones they're coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> along but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

840
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:13,980
have an increased number that are

841
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:15,660
overdue so there's some idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

842
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,070
perhaps we should update the milestones

843
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:18,779
at the same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the Charter</font>

844
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:22,730
admittedly the milestones aren't

845
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:25,830
considered that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> T or binding a thing</font>

846
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:30,360
most ITF working groups but it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

847
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:36,870
good to get these milestones set to

848
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:39,390
something that's plausible see so that's

849
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:41,790
really the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last item we have for</font>

850
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:43,290
presentation is there any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other topic or</font>

851
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:53,009
