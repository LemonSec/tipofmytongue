00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,390
he Joe tell you how pleased we were to

9
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,800
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosting this meeting and</font>

10
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,780
sponsoring the hackathon throughout the

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,939
year we're also pleased to present a

12
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:13,570
technical topic for the lunch speaker

13
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:15,669
series today so we have an Andy malice

14
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:18,070
who many of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of you perhaps</font>

15
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,869
know I served<font color="#E5E5E5"> with him on the IAB back</font>

16
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,449
in two thousand eight something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

17
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:24,820
that Andy's a distinguished engineer at

18
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,320
huawei and specializes in product and

19
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,380
network architecture and future

evolution standards leadership customer

21
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:35,979
consultation and a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of protocols</font>

22
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:38,770
mostly in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the routing area he used to be</font>

23
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:42,658
at verizon<font color="#CCCCCC"> tellabs cascade</font>

24
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:45,548
communications and BBM he's been around

25
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,880
so I'm gonna skip a lot of the rest of

26
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:50,170
the bio here and just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and he's</font>

27
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,670
going to talk about building into n

28
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:56,829
service experience assured network<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

29
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,860
hello everybody I'm Andy can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you all</font>

30
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:03,520
hear me<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay in the back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool very</font>

31
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:05,500
good so anyway this<font color="#E5E5E5"> right here is an</font>

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,929
outline of the talk basically what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,110
want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> you about is an outline of</font>

34
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:12,790
the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> space requirements and</font>

35
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,280
challenges that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing from new</font>

36
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:18,280
applications on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet current</font>

37
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,030
work to address these requirements both

38
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,790
here at

39
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:25,140
ietf and elsewhere and other stos as

40
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:28,209
well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> other work may be needed</font>

41
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,989
proposals for the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do have a</font>

42
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:34,300
spoiler alert here I don't plan to come

43
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:38,080
with any P package solutions to

44
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:41,080
basically cram down your throats what

45
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,190
I'm here for is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really to provide you</font>

46
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:48,069
all with some food for thought and

47
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:50,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully further discussion down the</font>

48
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:54,160
line and perhaps the formation of some

49
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:58,480
new work here in the IETF and elsewhere

50
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,070
so with that let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> going you know</font>

51
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:06,310
the internet of course has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a huge</font>

52
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:09,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">success and it's um ipv4 v6 are the</font>

53
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,380
narrow waist of the internet and they

54
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,220
support countless applications as we

55
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:17,170
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know there's some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

56
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,730
who try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the argument that HTTP</font>

57
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,470
is the new narrow waist but there's

58
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,510
still a lot of applications in fact

59
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:26,200
majority of applications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't run</font>

60
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:29,530
over HTTP here in a browser they really

61
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:34,018
do run straight over IP and then the UDP

62
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:37,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">era sheep or TCP and so on however</font>

63
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:39,910
today's<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet especially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cut what</font>

64
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,429
we think of as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> public best-effort</font>

65
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet does have a number of</font>

66
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenges that still need to be</font>

67
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:51,100
addressed in fact most notably elec

68
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,458
widely available and to end service

69
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:57,340
guarantees the things like latency

70
00:03:54,459 --> 00:04:00,609
jitter and packet loss and if this

71
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:03,190
really limits the some applications that

72
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:04,510
people would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to bring</font>

73
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,640
onto the internet and i'll be talking

74
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:09,548
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the requirements for those going</font>

75
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:13,839
forward and the focus<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this talk is</font>

76
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:16,720
really to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what we can do with</font>

77
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,820
a wide area with the wider area

78
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">multidomain open Internet you know I</font>

79
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:24,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">really don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to talk about private</font>

80
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:27,340
campus and data<font color="#E5E5E5"> central networks or very</font>

81
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">well managed single domain traffic</font>

82
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,409
engineered networks because those all

83
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:35,169
basically run pretty well but

84
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:37,800
therefore limited applications and you

85
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:40,599
know it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what we what we</font>

86
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:45,459
really deal with here which is the

87
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:48,878
public<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet so here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are a few of the</font>

88
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:51,399
architectural just before I move off the

89
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:55,269
slide there was one example that I just

90
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:57,849
wanted to to talk to which is um you

91
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:59,919
know just talking for personal

92
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:02,469
experience I've got pretty good internet

93
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,649
service at home you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got fios</font>

94
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:10,179
from verizon which is a jeep on based

95
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:13,749
service I've got 75 megabits symmetric

96
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:16,089
coming into my house but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even still you</font>

97
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:21,999
know if I'm streaming<font color="#E5E5E5"> video off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the net</font>

98
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:24,729
there can be times when when the video

99
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:26,860
playback exceeds the local buffering

100
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:28,179
that I received off net and I start

101
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,579
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the twirling you know what I'm</font>

102
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:33,549
sure this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something that that you're</font>

103
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:35,739
all very familiar with<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 and so you know</font>

104
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,349
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> with with the great service I've</font>

105
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:42,248
got coming into my house still somewhere

106
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:46,539
along the line there are barriers to it

107
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:49,089
being as good<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it could be so so just</font>

108
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:51,159
with that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know here are some of the</font>

109
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:53,619
architectural issues that really prevent

110
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:56,308
end-to-end internet service guarantees

111
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:58,749
well you know some of them are

112
00:05:56,309 --> 00:06:00,519
coordination across multiple layers and

113
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:02,889
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking more about this</font>

114
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:04,029
this is kind of like a preview a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

115
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:06,369
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be talking about</font>

116
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:08,679
today you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of point</font>

117
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:11,319
solutions that people are talking about

118
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:13,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the various layers the link layer and</font>

119
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,550
the network layer and the upper layers

120
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:17,079
and then the control<font color="#E5E5E5"> planes but very</font>

121
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,139
often there isn't a whole lot of

122
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:22,779
coordination going on between all the

123
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:24,729
different point solutions and so what

124
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:26,739
you might see is you know things aren't

125
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:29,679
quite as optimal as they could be in

126
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:30,969
terms of what people are working on and

127
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:33,729
what they could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

128
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:37,269
future especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> with regards to</font>

129
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:40,508
various stos and lube is cos<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you</font>

130
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:42,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the IETF and a lot of our sister</font>

131
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:45,210
standards development organizations such

132
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:50,520
as the broadband forum I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tripoli</font>

um and no<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3G 3G that's that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in you know</font>

134
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:59,969
3gpp and um and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on and so forth and</font>

135
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:03,000
so each is each is basically looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

136
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:04,650
their own<font color="#CCCCCC"> slice of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the puzzle and it's</font>

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,020
saying okay what can we do to improve

138
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:11,219
things for example from the broad bands

139
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:12,810
form and access networks for 3gpp what

140
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,300
can we do to improve things and mobile

141
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,880
networks and I Triple E what can we do

142
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,580
to improve things that the you know at

143
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,020
the ethernet layer but in some cases

144
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,229
there isn't a whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of coordination</font>

145
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:28,258
going on and it's difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

146
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:31,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">interoperable solutions as a result and</font>

147
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:33,330
you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly is a mechanism</font>

148
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:36,479
for cross stl cooperation which is

149
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,460
liaisons however you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know liaisons don't</font>

150
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,919
work often don't work very effectively

151
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,258
when you have a very complicated problem

152
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:46,310
set you know you need some more

153
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:49,919
concentrated the thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> and no and</font>

154
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,780
cooperation than just passing liaisons

155
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,549
back and forth to each other and then

156
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,080
there are things going on in the service

157
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,520
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> writers as well and i come from a</font>

158
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,198
source of art of background that was

159
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,490
with with verizon for a number years

160
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,530
before joining<font color="#CCCCCC"> Huawei for example so</font>

161
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:07,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've certainly got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of experience</font>

162
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:09,508
here there's very inconsistent

163
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:13,039
implementation of a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the work</font>

164
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:15,900
we've already done you know dis serve is

165
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,930
is what 15 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> old now if not longer</font>

166
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,690
than that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm 20 years old and then we</font>

167
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:24,659
have dis serve te which which goes back

168
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:26,669
to like two thousand five or so but you

169
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:28,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't see a whole lot of you see a lot</font>

170
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:32,520
of implementation of it in private

171
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,899
networks and in well-managed enterprise

172
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,468
service networks but you really don't

173
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:41,190
see a lot of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-to-end in the public</font>

174
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:42,990
internet and in the public<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet you</font>

175
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,450
also see there's an inability for the

176
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:48,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">service fighters to aggregate like flows</font>

177
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:51,810
together so<font color="#E5E5E5"> like flows can have similar</font>

178
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:53,400
treatment to the backbone now in in you

179
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,910
know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the public</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet it's really</font>

180
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">impossible to do flow by flow treatment</font>

181
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,800
you know each individual flow the

182
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,140
network because

183
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,430
you just can't scale and if you know

184
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,519
there's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we have to do in the</font>

185
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:08,339
internet scale but aggregation works

186
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,410
very well when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to scaling so if</font>

187
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,060
you can effectively aggregate for

188
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,579
example all low latency traffic together

189
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,768
and put that through a particular path

190
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,420
to the network then that may do better

191
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:21,329
than what we're doing now which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

192
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,370
basically nothing at all and you know

193
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:25,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">even if these things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do get implemented</font>

194
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,470
by one particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> service provider in</font>

195
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,269
there a s very often you don't see it in

196
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,269
the next is a lot of the path because

197
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:36,870
very few of us are in the same AAS as

198
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:40,170
all the servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we go to throughout</font>

199
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:42,360
the internet right certainly when we're

200
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:45,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">here in Korea we're in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very different</font>

201
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,160
a s locally then you know all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

202
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,699
servers are that we know we talked to

203
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:53,579
back home<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on and there's a whole</font>

204
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:56,279
lot of lack coordination across a s

205
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:58,500
boundaries you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know very often the cross</font>

206
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:01,470
is boundaries what you have is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

207
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,750
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a layer to link you know</font>

208
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:07,050
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> what like 100 gig in link</font>

209
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:09,060
between service providers which is you

210
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:11,010
know fine in terms of bandwidth but

211
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,770
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that you know you lose a</font>

212
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:17,910
whole lot in at the IP layer for the

213
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:19,829
treatment of the packets so um do a

214
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,689
whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> new things coming down the</font>

215
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:23,189
line to that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay attention to</font>

216
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:26,310
in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the requirements on the</font>

217
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:29,910
internet and one of the big ones is 5g

218
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:35,699
and network slicing and we had a two

219
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:38,730
hour meeting here in at the IETF about

220
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,950
this on Tuesday night and so I can't

221
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:43,410
encapsulate in you know in two minutes

222
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,510
what we covered in two hours and tuesday

223
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,579
night but I just have a couple slide to

224
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,959
give you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very big overview for for</font>

225
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:52,319
those you who weren't here Tuesday night

226
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,719
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i really encourage you to to take a</font>

227
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,750
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the slides that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were presented</font>

228
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,940
in that side meeting with regards to 5g

229
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:03,720
slicing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it freely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the topic so</font>

230
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,670
anyway so some of the of the challenges

231
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,339
is if you take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the chart</font>

232
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:10,529
that's from the ng MN 5g white paper

233
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:12,579
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the source for this</font>

234
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:14,999
chart it's talking about a whole lot

235
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:18,339
of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> applications that you that</font>

236
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:20,079
five the folks who are designing 5g want

237
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:22,689
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run over mobile networks</font>

238
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:27,878
the 5g mobile networks and it talks

239
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:30,639
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements in terms of user</font>

240
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:32,649
experience data rates which are easy

241
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:36,100
enough to<font color="#CCCCCC"> meet perhaps but what's very</font>

242
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:38,499
hard is what you see in red which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

243
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,059
m2m latency that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see in</font>

244
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:41,860
order for these particular applications

245
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:45,488
to work you know in some cases you have

246
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:47,439
Layton sees under<font color="#E5E5E5"> one millisecond in</font>

247
00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:50,829
order for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for a particular</font>

248
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:53,949
application to work over 5 g and this is

249
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:56,949
what the mobile folks are aiming towards

250
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:58,748
so um then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing they're</font>

251
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:00,729
working towards is called<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

252
00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:02,619
slicing and it'll be a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more on the</font>

253
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">next slide what the whole point of</font>

254
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:06,249
network slicing is that you can have

255
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:09,759
different applications and different

256
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:11,799
users that actually get their own what

257
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:15,220
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of as a private part of</font>

258
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:19,119
the 5g network<font color="#CCCCCC"> end-to-end or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

259
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:21,220
from the radio all the way into the data

260
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:23,709
center you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can think of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it as</font>

261
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,839
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own private part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of 5g</font>

262
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:28,899
network that's supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be completely</font>

263
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,149
unaffected by anything else that anyone

264
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:33,100
else does and the 5g network and have

265
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:34,839
completely private data on that and so

266
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,980
on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard problem as</font>

267
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:38,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">well because you have to have complete</font>

268
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,419
isolation of one users traffic from

269
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:43,239
another user's traffic while still

270
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:45,549
sharing common resources in the network

271
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:48,429
so it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult problem and</font>

272
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:49,720
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we spent two hours on Tuesday</font>

273
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:53,799
night talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that was really</font>

274
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:57,069
just scratching the surface<font color="#CCCCCC"> um the folks</font>

275
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:58,749
over in in in the mobile SEOs request

276
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:02,259
spending a whole lot more time talking

277
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:04,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this and so as I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> empty</font>

278
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:06,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">latency in particular is a very strong</font>

279
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:09,910
requirement for what's coming up in 5g

280
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:12,429
so this right here so the work and 5g

281
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:14,319
slicing is going to really require a

282
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:16,988
whole lot of innovation in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world of</font>

283
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:20,529
quality service just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you have to</font>

284
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:22,209
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guaranteed services for the</font>

285
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:26,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">applications going to be that are going</font>

286
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:29,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be running over 5 g and those require</font>

287
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:33,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">feet isolation from each other and so um</font>

288
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,019
what what I think the mobile folks are

289
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:38,029
finding is that current<font color="#E5E5E5"> QoS mechanisms</font>

290
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:40,120
that we have in routers today for

00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:42,350
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the switches don't always</font>

292
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,730
meet the requirements that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

293
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,459

294
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,620
a lot of innovation throughout the

295
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:50,449
networking industry I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think no not just</font>

296
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the mobile space in the radio space</font>

297
00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:56,000
but in the router space you know because

298
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:57,410
routers make up the backbone of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile</font>

299
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,750
networks as we all know you know if

<font color="#CCCCCC">you're doing mobile front hall mobile</font>

301

backhaul that's all implemented<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

302
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,380
routers right so so that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

303
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:08,209
that's going to require a lot of

304
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,760
innovation in the router space in<font color="#CCCCCC"> order</font>

305
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:14,989
to be able to implement the requirements

306

coming out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 5 g now some other</font>

307
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,339
applications that we're seeing that

00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:23,649
people would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to use is</font>

309
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:28,579

experiences whether it's a single person

314
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:43,730
or multi-person virtual reality and

315
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:46,820
augmented reality and there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

316
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:49,459
very definite latency requirements to

reality and augmented reality through

319
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:56,329
the internet now in some cases you have

320
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:59,329
to worry about the actual speed of light

321
00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:03,709
delay between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user and the server</font>

322
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:06,410
because if you exceed about 20

323
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:08,239
milliseconds of delay for virtual

324
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:10,399
reality or augmented reality you start

325
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,660
getting a disconnect between a person's

326
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,779
movements and what you're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

327
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,819
their eyes which leads to it to some

328
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:18,410
extreme vertigo which you want to avoid

329
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:21,680
certainly or else it becomes a very

330
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:23,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">unpleasant experience for the user so in</font>

331
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,569
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases this is going to require</font>

332
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,029
not only thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do about</font>

333
00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:32,779
latency but also some intelligent work

334
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:34,490
towards what's the right place what's

335
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:37,790
the right placement for the servers for

336
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:40,180
the for the service and routing the

337
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:43,329
users packets to the proper server so

338
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:45,489
they get the proper latency<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

339
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:48,760
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in cases like this you get you</font>

340
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:51,730
can imagine a whole set of distributed

341
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,950
servers and then a part of the puzzle is

342
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:56,680
not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we can do in the network</font>

343
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:58,810
to reduce the latency between the users

344
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,359
and the service<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also making sure</font>

345
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:06,069
that we're out the users<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the proper</font>

346
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:08,680
service<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well so and of course another</font>

347
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,209
part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the puzzle is bandwidth as well</font>

348
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:15,579
because you want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

349
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:17,800
have enough bandwidth that's that's

350
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,930
basically guaranteed to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service so</font>

351
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,329
that the user gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> excellent quality</font>

352
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:27,060
service in their headsets you know

353
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:29,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically 4k video then we have other</font>

354
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,290
applications that are coming online that

355
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:34,449
people would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to</font>

356
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:37,510
basically bring into the wide area

357
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:40,000
whether it's remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care you know</font>

358
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:43,050
that's becoming very important and in

359
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,310
some cases you know people are already

360
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:46,959
attempting this but they're really<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

361
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:49,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing it over the public Internet</font>

362
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,449
they're doing it over these flying

363
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:55,599
circuits for example just because you

364
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:57,820
really at this point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time can't trust</font>

365
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,120
doing things like remote surgery over

366
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:04,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">the public internet right so but in the</font>

367
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,750
future if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could harden the public</font>

368
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:11,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet to the point where you could</font>

369
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:14,380
guarantee the service to the end to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

that they could use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same the same</font>

374
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:28,300
for just the<font color="#CCCCCC"> record keeping and so on</font>

375
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,590
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> regular internet access that would</font>

376
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,080
be a big boon to that it would certainly

377
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:34,659
cut down on<font color="#CCCCCC"> their costs and that would</font>

378
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,730
be you know a big win factory automation

379
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:40,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know that's something that's being</font>

380
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:42,040
done an awful lot very right now it's

381
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:44,559
being done with specialized networks

382
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,629
again because you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> guarantee the</font>

383
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,399
latency to make sure that you know the

00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:51,880
machines get the feedback that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they need</font>

385
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,770
at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they need it and if you</font>

386
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,710
want to be able to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to the</font>

387
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:58,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">right area so you could for example</font>

388
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:01,360
coordinate what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> between a</font>

389
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:02,890
number of factories then another

question may have to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

guarantee<font color="#E5E5E5"> latency requirements that are</font>

392

393
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:14,440
smart grid is another thing that people

394
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,730
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about and and in there of</font>

395
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,630
course there were latency requirements

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:22,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">editor that have to do with the phasing</font>

397

of the electrical power you know to make

398

sure that being generated correctly and

399
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:28,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want to make sure if you have</font>

at the time that is needed so you know

from you know coming on the internet if

it could provide the you know the lost

management and the latency management

412

that you require now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not the</font>

saw the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet Society held a workshop</font>

416
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:15,670
on latency and at the time that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

417
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:18,580
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago so at that time they</font>

418
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:20,980
basically held a reducing<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

419
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:24,370
latency workshop and what they found are

420
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:26,290
a taxonomy for the major sources of

421
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:29,110

00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:31,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's processing delay you know</font>

426
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:45,070
so on then you have multiplexing delays

needed to support sharing<font color="#CCCCCC"> share channel</font>

acquisition output queuing and so on and

429
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:52,870
then you have grouping which is you know

00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,560
reduced frequency of control information

431

free to to to check it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime you</font>

435
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,910
like

436
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,800
oh and by the way so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to</font>

437
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,890
write down<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like this we're going</font>

438
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:17,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be making these slides available</font>

439
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:19,210
they're not yet online but but we we

440
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:22,360
will be putting them online as part of

441
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:25,960
the ITF proceedings so just be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

442
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,850
go to proceedings page and<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to to</font>

443
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,860
get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the talks you can get all</font>

444
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:32,290
the links and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything else so anyway</font>

445
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,330
so the workshops report concluded

446
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:37,420
basically that there are fundamental

447
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:39,159
limits this was in 2013 to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> extent to</font>

448
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,830
which latency can be reduced in the

449
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:44,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet there's also considerable</font>

450
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,730
capacity for improvement and it's that

451
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,770
capacity<font color="#CCCCCC"> for improvement that I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

452
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:49,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about throughout the system</font>

453
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:52,990
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet latency a multi-faceted</font>

454
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,940
challenge and it certainly is but as it

455
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:57,330
says this capacity for improvement and

456
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,800
that's what we're going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

457
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:01,860
then they also said how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to standardize a</font>

458
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,149
definition of access network latency

459
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">essential latency can be used like big</font>

460
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:08,410
bandwidth as a unit of convert<font color="#CCCCCC"> Commerce</font>

461
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,939
turns out to be a hard problem and

462
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,830
that's something actually that the

463
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,380
broadband forum is looking at now and

464
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:17,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be talking about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a moment</font>

465
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:20,920
so what's changed since the report in

466
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,810
2013 well there's a whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

467
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,870
solutions going on and i'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking a</font>

468
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:30,220
lot about those point solutions low

469
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:32,409
latency is is um so crucial that<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

470
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,990
we're finding the content as a whole is

471
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:37,360
much more distributed then even was

472
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:40,630
three years ago you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we have you</font>

473
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,030
know CD ends we have service<font color="#CCCCCC"> of artists</font>

474
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">like Verizon who are taking all their</font>

475
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:47,710
video content in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there putting it into</font>

00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,979
their access network very close to their

477
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:54,340
customer and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth</font>

478
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:56,560
basically um the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> providers</font>

479
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,540
who provide the content are moving the

480
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,340
content as close to the customer as

481
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,980
possible and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's especially true in</font>

482
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,780
things like multi-user gaming where you

483
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,760
need low latency and in other

484
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,639
applications where you basically want to

485
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:12,460
be able to to provide some amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

486
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,110
bandwidth for the content or or quality

487
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:16,270
of service<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the content that's coming</font>

488
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:18,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the user so that the user has a good</font>

489
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:20,770
experience as they consume the content

490
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:24,040
and

491
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:27,430
oh there's there are management<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems</font>

492
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:29,470
which need access and visibility to

493
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,810
network latency characteristics like you

494
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,940
really intelligently place the flows

495
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:37,090
going through the network so that the

496
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:41,890
best server you know is utilized for

497
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:43,389
each individual user and then of course

498
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:46,900
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> much easier with stored content</font>

499
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:49,300
than it is with with a dynamically

500
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:53,020
rendered content such as ritual or

501
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:54,639
augmented reality or or gaming and so on

502
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,680
although there's been some amount of

503
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,680
work as I said that's starting with that

504
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:02,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well there's advancements of</font>

layers and exploring technologies to

00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:09,640
meet low latency technologies and the

i think is some<font color="#E5E5E5"> really innovative work</font>

00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,890
from google if you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> said is you know they're</font>

514
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:25,210
looking they're taking a more systematic

515

view of what are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> layton season</font>

00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:30,070
bringing up a web page in your browser

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:32,560
and what they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> was they said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well gee</font>

518
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:35,020
do a couple components of of latency and

519
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:37,030
bringing up a web page one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them is</font>

520
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:40,330
actually getting the TCP connection open

521
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:43,510
and none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them is getting security</font>

522
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:45,699
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> for HTTPS right so they said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

523
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:47,650
rather than first getting the TCP

524
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:51,060
connection open with the handshake<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:54,790
then doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the security handshake</font>

526
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:56,409
let's combine them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's quick so</font>

527
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:58,510
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they do is they have a</font>

528
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:00,370
new transport protocol which combines

runs over UDP<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know it's an</font>

00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,719

532
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,610
it's a point solution but it's a nice

point solution to one of the problems

534

that people see another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is l4s which</font>

not really meant for wide-area use at

are working on the broadband forms

work going on here called debt net debt

555
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:12,850
net really is aimed at deterministic

556
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:16,240
delay rather than particularly low delay

557
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:19,439
it's making it a deterministic that cuts

558
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,179
down on the jitter or change in delay

559
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,100
and it's also meant for particularly

560
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:25,860
constrained environments<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not meant</font>

561
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,750
for use on the wide area internet

562
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:31,270
there's I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Triple E 802 that one time</font>

563
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:33,580
sensitive networking which is again just

00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:36,040
taking a link layer view of what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:39,790
done for it for time-sensitive

00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:49,510
and O I<font color="#CCCCCC"> F which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically taking a</font>

569
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:52,780
TDM like approach to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet way you</font>

570
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:54,850
still use ethernet framing but in the

571
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:58,210
transport of the ethernet frames you

572
00:25:54,850 --> 00:26:00,959
actually allocate TDM like circuits and

573
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:03,550
so you're able to arm to provide

574
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,380
bandwidth guarantees for these<font color="#E5E5E5"> net but</font>

575
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:08,889
again this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just an Ethernet layer</font>

576
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:11,350
solution and then 3gpp with regards to

577
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:15,970
mobile I'm has started multiple projects

578
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:19,780
we basically related to reducing latency

579
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:22,059
in the radio area networks in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

mobile access core and in mobile

581
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:28,899
backhaul and and and again but that's

582
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,610
really aimed at the mobile solution with

583
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,770
latest technologies advancements in

584
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:35,320
packet networks it's really becoming

585
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:37,780
feasible for us to petition access

586
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:40,059
network resources to dedicate resources

587
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,620
to flows at NIDA terminates of latency

588
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:44,559
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be looking a</font>

00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:23,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">the work is actually quite large they've</font>

645

got a lot of work on going<font color="#E5E5E5"> there looking</font>

00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:30,010
at use cases which they call scenarios

terminology requirements and

648
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:34,590

and business and marketing documents and

663
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:17,920
so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think really the thing that</font>

664
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,960
we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be paying most attention to I</font>

think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most important for our use is</font>

00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:25,390
going to be what they do with their

information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and data modeling and to</font>

668
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,420
make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some conformance with</font>

669
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,969
work that we're doing here especially

670
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:34,090
with yang because as we know of is

671
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:35,470
already a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> yang coordination going</font>

672
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:37,540
on throughout the industry we want to

00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:39,790
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this gets included with</font>

00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:43,860
the yang coordination that's going on

675
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:46,960
both here at the IETF and throughout the

<font color="#E5E5E5">have to feed back into the work that we</font>

underlying technology owned by another

684
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,780
sto and that includes us so if there's

685
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,300
something that they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be done in</font>

00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:13,780
the IP layer well they'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be coming to</font>

687

ietf and they expect I Triple E as well

691
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:26,800
as required to jointly improve the

692
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:30,220
technology so<font color="#E5E5E5"> um the there's also flex</font>

693
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:32,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ethernet flex season that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about</font>

694
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:35,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before basically this was a joint</font>

695
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:41,860
project between oef and I Tripoli to

696
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:44,380
give TDM arm reliability<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and and</font>

697
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:46,870
performance guarantees to Ethernet

698
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:52,060
traffic but again as I said it's a point

699
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:54,340
solution the IETF is also has work I

700
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:59,020
already talked about the work that was

701
00:31:54,340 --> 00:32:01,120
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> in l4s which is looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at queuing</font>

702
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,070
delay and latency but it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I</font>

703
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,719
said before a point solution quick I

704
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:07,300
talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ready and detonate I</font>

705
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,160
already talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about as well but this</font>

706
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">but you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's important just to</font>

707
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:15,070
recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we already have worked on</font>

708
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:17,200
going in the IETF and and so we want to

709
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:20,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">make sure that that continues now what</font>

710
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,930
we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> really seeing as a result of this</font>

711
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:26,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">is we're seeing a lot of point solutions</font>

712
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:29,830
in multiple stos from the link layer

713
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:33,550
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> flex internet into into connections</font>

714
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:39,550
with a flexi and channel MPLS based then

715
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:42,190
slicing and adaptive queue management

716
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:44,950
debt net at working up through the

717

network layer to 5g<font color="#E5E5E5"> network slicing l4s</font>

718
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:51,400
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the application layer with</font>

719
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:53,590
things like quick and so on and but what

720
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,530
we really want to see is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

721
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:58,449
of a system level thinking about the

722
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:00,460
problem you know we have point solutions

723
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:02,110
but I think what's more important than

724
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:05,290
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> point solutions is trying to look</font>

725
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:07,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">at an overall system approach to latency</font>

726
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:08,950
you know what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do to think about</font>

727
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:11,770
this as an end-to-end problem not just

728
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:16,810
as a series of point solutions that are

729
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:18,940
being done in various places so we've

730
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:22,750
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some some thinking about this</font>

731
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:24,790
inside huawei and what we're doing is a

732
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,830
bit of experimentation that we're

733
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:29,200
calling shun for now a service

734
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:30,370
experience assured network what we're

735
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to aim for</font>

736
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:35,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">word to in particular environments is</font>

737
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:37,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">ultra-low latency and jitter zero packet</font>

738
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:40,260
loss constant bandwidth assurance and

739
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:44,500
on-demand zero weight deployment and

740
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:47,890
we're basically doing that by taking you

741
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:49,330
know a more cross-layer approach to the

742
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:50,740
problem and looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

743
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:53,290
problems in each of the layers and what

744
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:56,110
can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do at each of the layers so for</font>

745
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:58,750
example for service deployment looking

746
00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:01,419
at for example Sen based solutions is a

747
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:03,760
possibility to manage end-to-end service

748
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:06,460
and and signaling across various Network

749
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,840
domains via protocol extensions and then

750
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:11,820
what can we do within a particular

751
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:14,020
network such as network resource

752
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:17,679
allocation and reservation for

753
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:20,590
particular large flows algorithms for

754
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:24,909
network resource and delay planning and

755
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:26,050
then within a single router what can do

756
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:28,710
there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do ultra-low latency</font>

757
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:31,530
forwarding architecture and routers

758
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:33,820
optimizing packet processing for example

759
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:35,710
improving your traffic management

760
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:37,899
capabilities for low latency and<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero</font>

classification within the routers and

763
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:46,710
then at layer 1<font color="#E5E5E5"> and 2</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make use of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">right here is a demo that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're working</font>

you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll move traffic generators</font>

show that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the VR</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I are still</font>

780
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:35,380

781
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:38,350
here this is my last<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide basically</font>

00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:41,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we'd like to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is further</font>

783
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:43,900
development of new technologies and

784
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,630
achieve low latency end-to-end and why

785
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:50,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">over wide area packet networks to enable</font>

786
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:52,240
more latency sensitive applications to

787
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:55,060
better utilize the technologies we

788
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,189
already have and to do more<font color="#E5E5E5"> system level</font>

00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:01,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking for technologies that we don't</font>

00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:05,410
yet have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know being for working done</font>

791
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:07,089
both here and other stos as well so you

792
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:09,100
know one of the things that possible

00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:11,800
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> occur</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to us is a workshop</font>

00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">couple days you know talk about their</font>

798
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:23,560
about some system level thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> and end</font>

799
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,300
to to have you no more effective

800
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,430
solutions than just to the point

801
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:30,700
solutions that we've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

802
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:32,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">to so far we really want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> focus on</font>

803
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:35,620
cross-layer interactions and

804
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,450
system-level issues perhaps leading to

805
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:40,779
new standardization here or elsewhere

806
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:43,149
based on the results<font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer basically</font>

807
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,800
the questions that you see here other

808
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,540
advantage to be gained from taking a

809
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,340
broader view<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different technologies</font>

810
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:51,100
at the different layers and what their

811
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:52,780
interactions are what are the effective

812
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,210
interactions the coordination is between

813
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:58,840
upper and lower layers such we can make

814
00:36:55,210 --> 00:37:01,300
effective optimization of you know with

815
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:05,050
latency and let unless sensitive

816
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:06,760
services and given the larger issues let

817
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:09,580
that prevent and service guarantees

818
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:11,890
what's the what where can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we most</font>

819
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:14,920
intelligent li tap the problem to get

00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:16,720
the biggest bang for a buck so with that

821
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:19,110
I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know if you have any</font>

838
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:10,830
bubble husband that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can imagine I</font>

839
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:13,540
that you will have to worry about

843
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,640
means i will<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably have to charge</font>

844
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:27,850
extra for that so this so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

845
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">kept use it either deliberately or mine</font>

846
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:33,160
just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm greedy right and which</font>

847
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:36,040
now means that if i have that service as

848
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:38,350
a consumer if one of my application goes

849
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,870
rogue I'm not just have a denial of

850
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:42,339
service attack on my link i also have a

851
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:48,279
denial of service attack on my bank

852
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:51,250
account yes yeah and so so I wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

853
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,680
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your Sean exploration you</font>

00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:01,960
matter has thought about how you can

856
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:04,960
prevent exactly that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will</font>

857
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,060
probably stifle one story like that will

858
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,510
probably kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of take people's enjoyment</font>

859
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:13,150
out of a augmented reality yes it

860
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:14,830
absolutely especially in the bass work

861
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:17,200
in the broadband forum security is is

862
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:18,759
absolutely a part of the architectural

863
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,109
work that they're doing there you know

864
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,420
I'd have a chance to include everything

865
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:24,190
but absolutely securities apart there as

approach and says let's see if we can

898
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,120
get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work across domains</font>

going to make it different and actually

work<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time well sure horse RSVP</font>

920
00:41:53,510 --> 00:42:00,370
serious um reservation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a problem</font>

921
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:03,410
absolutely I agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you but there</font>

922
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:05,150
there may be other ways to solve it as

923
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:07,759
well one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the BBF is</font>

924
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:10,420
looking at actually into in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of</font>

925
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,670
reservation is looking at applications

926
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:19,070
where you might actually do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

927
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:21,050
like have a web form where you can you

928
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:23,840
can reserve bandwidth in advance for a

929
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:24,690
particular purpose the quest then we

930
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,030
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at whether</font>

931
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:28,260
protocols behind that are but you know

932
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:30,180
that that's one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

933
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,220
PDF is talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about for example I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

934
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:36,299
also encourage people thinking about

935
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:39,899
this to step away from the entirely too

attractive ete acronym and start

937
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:44,880
figuring out where the actual problems

938
00:42:42,089 --> 00:42:46,619
are and how to solve them you mentioned

939
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm particularly that that biologically</font>

00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:52,290
not the backbones the background

942
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:54,869

947
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,369
cloning I work for one of the internet

948
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:11,220
registries that's probably less relevant

949
00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:13,079
and I'm certainly not expecting an

950
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:15,000
authoritative answer from you but would

951
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:17,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">love to wear your opinion but yeah what</font>

952
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,680
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your first slides contain the</font>

953
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:21,209
hourglass model yes and then sort of

954
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:24,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">from an architectural point in the way I</font>

955
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:26,910
saw if she it is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

956
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:29,430
creating sort of these different slices

957
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:31,348
that 555 g calls slices people<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

958
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:33,540
different terminology where would you

959
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:36,230
would you expect that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we still be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

960
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:38,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">to sustain that hourglass or do we get a</font>

961
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:40,710
multistem our gloss or would it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

962
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:43,440
multiple our glosses sort of glue to the

963
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:46,710
same base where would we end up

964
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,839
architectural<font color="#CCCCCC"> II do you think well I</font>

965
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:52,460
don't see a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of change coming</font>

966
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:58,740
to the hourglass model um just because

967
00:43:52,460 --> 00:44:02,599
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it is and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know in the</font>

968
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:04,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">in in the future you know as I said</font>

969
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:09,720
people have talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hourglass</font>

970
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:11,520
moving up to http right and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

971
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,439
think of it maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> as rather than an</font>

972
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,210
hourglass you have the top and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

973
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,150
have HTTP then you have a widening then

974
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:20,040
another narrowing it at IP then it

975
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,450
expands<font color="#E5E5E5"> again and you know and it may</font>

976
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,940
end up being a model that looks

977
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:26,220
something like that in the future so

978
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:28,680
we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about out of time Linda last</font>

983
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:40,450
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed I see</font>

984
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:42,310
p has been a headache for the past and

985
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:44,140
there's answer on the money and think

986
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:46,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

987
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:48,609
examples and nowadays and you will see

988
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:51,430
if you just search our internet like

989
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:53,650
latency monitoring services there's so

990
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:56,740
many new companies popping up to provide

991
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:58,660
their services because why because the

992
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:01,240
content managers continent system

993
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:03,490
Citians need that kind of exposure and

994
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,109
visibility to the network so that they

995
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:08,290
can distribute the content more

996
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:10,180
intelligently and and as Devi said end

997
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:13,360
to end the end to end doesn't mean from

998
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:15,940
here to us across the globe the end to

999
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:18,430
end more likely will be like the excess

1000
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:20,500
domain on the shorter like multiple hops

1001
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:22,600
and then be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to provide that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1002
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:25,960
low latency services that becomes more

1003
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:27,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">visible okay okay thanks and I'd like to</font>
