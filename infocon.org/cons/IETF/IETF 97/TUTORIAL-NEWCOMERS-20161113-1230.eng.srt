would you like instructions about the

12
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:49,010
IHF this presentation is all about how

13
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:53,840
to survive your<font color="#E5E5E5"> first IETF meeting and</font>

14
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:56,548
thrive my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike st. John's I'm Ben</font>

15
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,350
I have the dubious honor of having

16
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:02,430
attended more IEPs than anybody else

17
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:05,040
here I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to apologize in advance I</font>

18
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,410
my my throat has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> causing me</font>

19
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,548
problems for last few days I believe

20
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,519
I'll be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get through all this</font>

21
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:13,350
without coughing or sneezing but if I do

22
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,900
you know give me a give me a second to

23
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,640
recover and we'll continue on so um

24
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,220
before we get started as anybody know

25
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,899
what a protocol is the word protocol

26
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,340
give me do you have another one word

27
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:28,340
definition for protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright simplest</font>

28
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,170
definition of a protocol is an agreement

29
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,959
the IETF is all about agreements it's

30
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:37,320
all about figuring out how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font>

31
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,670
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do the same thing at</font>

32
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,049
the same time in the same place

33
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially when we're talking about</font>

34
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:47,100
networking protocols but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're also a</font>

group of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who have protocols that</font>

36
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,269
the deal with how we interact when we're

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:58,700
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meetings and over the network and</font>

working<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok you're going to see this</font>

44
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,850
you're going to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this slide at every</font>

00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,580
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF note well it described it</font>

48
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,100
basically says that when you're here and

49
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,950
you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about IETF things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

50
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,900

you want to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about if you if you</font>

52
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:52,120
walk into an ITF meeting and talk about

00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:54,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">an idea be aware that it's hard to claim</font>

54
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,890
IPR the intellectual property rights for

55
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,270
things like that this just says that

56
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:04,240
almost everything you do at an ietf

57
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:05,919
meeting as a pub is IETF related I'm

58
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,260
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about things that are</font>

59
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">immediately useful to you at this</font>

60
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,880
meeting we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna try and I'm not</font>

61
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,049
gonna talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> tuna Street eitf</font>

62
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,240
there's lots of place you can read<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

63
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,280
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about how to write</font>

64
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,470
a standard again lots of documentation

65
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,359
there there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other places go we've</font>

66
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,710
only gotten an hour to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I couldn't</font>

67
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,690
teach you how to write a standard in an

68
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:31,390
hour but there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> places you can go</font>

69
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:33,760
this is what I look like at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

70
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:36,340
the fruit of the longest IETF meeting

71
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,810
that I'd ever IETF working group meeting

72
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,280
I've ever attended who started about

73
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,370
eight o'clock in the morning we fish by

74

two o'clock the next morning so try not

75
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:47,920
to look like this at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of your</font>

76
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,840
first meeting talk about the meeting

77
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,580
talk about the difference between the

78
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,859
IETF and other standard development

79
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:56,770
organizations or talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a little bit</font>

80
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,500
about culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> and people think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

81
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,780
culture in different ways the IETF has a

82
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,050
culture we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about why our culture</font>

83
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,539
is important to you guys being here talk

84
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,060
about consensus etiquette for working

85
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,830
group meetings and general for the

86
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,900
meeting itself talk about the

87
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,449
differences between the birds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

and working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group sessions and why</font>

90
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:20,360
they're important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you as new</font>

91
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:21,409
attendees talk a little bit about some

00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:35,930
again because they meet with us they're

97
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:38,150
not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITF but you might find it useful</font>

98
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:40,400
to sit in one of their sessions and

99
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,839
understand what's going on and also talk

100
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,029
a little bit about other resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

102
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:51,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">and later on the IETF is an organized</font>

activity and Internet Society that

104
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,449
wasn't always the case the IETF was

105
00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:01,099
originally an engineering organization

112
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:20,748
engineering organization to what we

113
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:26,120
primarily are today a standard

114
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:28,159
organization you may not we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,159
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into into what a standard how the</font>

116
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:33,289
work gets done here most of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the work</font>

117
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:35,270
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see in the IETF gets done</font>

118
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:39,529
actually in subgroups the working groups

119
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:41,959
um you will encounter lots of them here

120
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:44,209
there's about 130 of them you also might

121
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:45,649
encounter the term in an architecture

122
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:46,849
board in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's probably one that</font>

123
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:49,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">you would have encountered before</font>

124
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:52,219
actually encountered the IETF because

125
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:55,189
that gets more of the press the public

126
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:57,080
press lots more details we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

127
00:07:55,189 --> 00:08:00,860
to worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are important</font>

128
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:03,349
to you right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have</font>

129
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:06,349
questions to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody with a little</font>

130
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:08,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little happy face on them they</font>

131
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:14,479
will help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to understand what's going</font>

132
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:18,379
on so I ETF is roughly divided into

133
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:21,229
these areas general applications

134
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:23,079
real-time transport Internet routing

135
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:26,180
operations and management and security

136
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:27,860
this is useful for you because if you

137
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,740
are interested in working group

138
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,419
it is associated with an area and other

139
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,570
working groups in that area may also

140
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:39,819
have interest for you so if you are a

141
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,820
security geek and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font>

142
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,930
authentication constrained environment

143
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,790
you might find something useful in say

144
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:51,589
TLS which is also a working group in

145
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:54,910
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> security area and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what</font>

lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different organizations and I</font>

believe Huawei is sponsoring the

182
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:38,300
development here it's about building

183
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,819
something with people who want to build

184
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">something with you really quickly the</font>

190
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:56,040
quite a bit by the people who did work

191
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,329
in the code sprints and then you're

192
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,880
going to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of non-public</font>

193
00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:01,620
business meetings which are you walk

194

off of the apple store it's built by

212

somebody who attends the IETF it's free

213
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,750

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,689
interested in making a network work as

220
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:17,760
opposed to a set of treaty organizations

221
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:20,670
companies coming together and deciding

222
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,370
they wanted to do something yeah we are

223
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:26,160
cell selected individual participants we

224
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:28,170
want to hear your ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do not want</font>

231
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,670
amount of respect in this community

232
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:48,649
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe in good technical</font>

presentations and good technical

237
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:04,830
has a standard for fruitcakes yeah I

238
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,540
know this very strange but you've got

239
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:10,680
you've got the national organizations

240
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:14,069
like NIST you've got a itu I so you've

241
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,709
got I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tripoli all over the place</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly</font>

242
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,270
they are organizationally based you

243
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,520
might have individual members but in

244
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:23,250
most cases the organization's rule here

245
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:27,210
it's the individuals<font color="#CCCCCC"> also many cases</font>

246
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:29,600
it's top down versus bottom up if you've

247
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,620
been involved some in another FSS do

248
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:40,410
throw away your pre concession

249
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:45,440
conceptions and listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we have a</font>

250
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:51,660
culture culture is not something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i</font>

251
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:53,190
can define except technical technical

252
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,890
strength tends to be the thing that

253
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:58,620
we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for we are informal um</font>

254
00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:00,380
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> more so than any organization</font>

255
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,220
you'll ever you ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal with</font>

256
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,270
fortunately we managed to get people to

257
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:08,070
dress for some of the meetings you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

258
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:13,680
we have actually had people come in

259
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:17,220
sometimes without shoes one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

260
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:21,000
fondest memories was of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10th IETF</font>

261
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:23,490
meeting we were at we were a cocoa beach

262
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,450
we were on a hotel right<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the beach</font>

263
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:29,790
and one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guys left the meeting</font>

264
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,620
when swimming came back and was standing

265
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:33,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the back of the room dripping wet</font>

266
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,150
listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the plenary presentation so</font>

267
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,160
that's how informal we can get hasn't

268
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:42,150
happened for a while we got larger but

269
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,430
still there these people are smart and

270
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:50,970
opinionated their self selected for

271
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:53,489
being here and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because sorry I'm</font>

272
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:56,270
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pass on that one we are like</font>

273
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:58,080
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> occasionally we get blunt</font>

274
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:03,720
occasionally you will be in a meeting

275
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:08,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">and somebody will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take your idea is I've</font>

276
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:09,340
sucks sorry um most people don't mean to

277
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,370
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> rude it</font>

278
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:15,030
is a style of presentation that we've

279
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,530
been trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get ourselves out of but</font>

280
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:20,350
30 years gives you a lot of the nur scia

281
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:23,620
so we are a long established

282
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:26,140
organization we have a culture you will

283
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,330
not be able to change it immediately you

284
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,520
change it by participating and by

285
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:32,710
putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff into the</font>

286
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">water and helping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to change the flavor</font>

287
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:37,330
of things but it's going to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

288
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:40,480
little at a time last piece is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

289
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:42,850
important to know if you bring an idea

290
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,740
forward and you try and<font color="#CCCCCC"> get 30 or 40</font>

291
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,530
people to bring the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same idea forward it</font>

292
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:50,790
better be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good one if it is a bad one</font>

293
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:52,810
and it's a company thing or a

294
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,810
organizational thing or you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

295
00:15:52,810 --> 00:16:02,859
do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's still a dumb idea and</font>

296
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:04,959
we know the difference this is it we're

297
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:07,030
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the internet and Internet</font>

298
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,370
related technologies we deal with things

299
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:11,110
that are at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet level sometimes</font>

300
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">it tiny a little bit underneath that</font>

301
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:15,340
with respect to things like mpls and

302
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:17,410
sometimes and things just a little bit

303
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:19,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">over that feeling with transport layers</font>

304
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,730
and things like that we mostly don't

305
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:25,870
deal with we occasionally deal with

306
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:28,030
applications but most of it is all about

307
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:31,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">how do you get the internet to work and</font>

308
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:34,480
how to get it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep working and and</font>

309
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:40,150
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you keep it from you know killing</font>

310
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:42,780
us manage manageable<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you're going</font>

311
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:45,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">to hear this term a lot consensus</font>

312
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:48,540
consensus is not voting we do not vote

313
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:51,100
here however we do try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and establish</font>

314
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,800
something called consensus and consensus

315
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,530
all about getting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense of whether</font>

316
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,199
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most of the people on</font>

317
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:02,980
board and whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not we've got onion</font>

318
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,959
resolve problems so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example let me</font>

319
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,150
give you an example of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we how we do</font>

320
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,940
how we evaluate consensus it's called

321
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:11,830
humming okay and you'll be in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting</font>

322
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,570
and somebody and if you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying</font>

323
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:16,208
attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> on something here humming and</font>

324
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:18,730
you go wait a<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute feedback yeah not</font>

325
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:21,000
feedback this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a way of evaluating</font>

326
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:23,140
consensus so for example in this room

327
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,420
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think</font>

328
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:30,160
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the room is too warm hum</font>

329
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:35,440
hmm if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the room is too cold</font>

330
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:41,110
hum come on really if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the room</font>

331
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:43,390
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> right hum so i can to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say so</font>

332
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:45,370
listen to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't i don't see a</font>

333
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,570
clear consensus on the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so</font>

334
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,550
what would end up happening is we

335
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,790
continue discussing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while and then</font>

336
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:52,750
i win because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is too hot in here</font>

337
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:55,180
sorry no it wouldn't happen that way

338
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,100
meaning etiquette please behave

339
00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:01,960
respectfully<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the other people in the</font>

340
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:04,659
room and by respectfully I mean be aware

341
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:09,450
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they may not be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same place</font>

342
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:12,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are with respect to with respect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

343
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:15,550
understanding of what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

344
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:17,590
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's I know sir it may be Stig</font>

345
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:19,389
Norwich rather than stupidity and in

346
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:21,100
fact it probably isn't it is a nurse

347
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:26,280
around stupidity but willful ignorance

348
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:28,899
is problematic so just be aware and be

349
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,040
be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit tolerant of people when</font>

350
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,310
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and we're going to be do</font>

at an ietf meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

thing out of your mouth every time is

397
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,600

405
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,680
an idea of how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people we need free</font>

406

for the rooms for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next time around</font>

407
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,850
the other one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get an idea</font>

408
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,889
of who's been paying attention for IEP

413

somebody to explain what's going on text

423

wise without actually having to interact

00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be in are going to be pretty crowded</font>

431
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:02,740
please be aware of your surroundings

432
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:05,950
move the bags let<font color="#E5E5E5"> people sit down side</font>

433
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:08,020
conversations outside mostly you can do

434
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,520
a few seconds with something but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in most</font>

435
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:15,670
cases if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you're being quiet</font>

436
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:20,290
you aren't so and jabber stuck so birds

437
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:22,390
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the feathers are sessions where we've</font>

438
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:23,830
got a new idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> or we've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

439
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:25,500
that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cry out or we've got</font>

440
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:29,439
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are interested something</font>

441
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:31,270
something fun so we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had birds of a</font>

442
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,180
feather sessions on internet of things

443
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:37,330
birds of a feather sessions on and I

444
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:40,690
lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> track over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the years the idea is</font>

445
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:43,000
the birds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a feather session is to get</font>

446
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:44,910
people involved get an idea whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

447
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,160
not we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should form a working group and</font>

448
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:49,840
have that conversation they tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font>

449
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,510
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more tutorial than working</font>

450
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,939
group sessions so you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some</font>

451
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:57,640
information beforehand but the key piece

452
00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:00,520
is they generally only meet once and

453
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:03,910
they either end up going away or

454
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,830
anything up as a working group so there

455
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:12,430
you've got most of all the stuff over

456
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:15,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">here um the working groups are ideally</font>

457
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:16,870
have a fixed life they are designed when

458
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,090
you start the working group you've got a

459
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:22,899
work plan and when the work plan has

460
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:24,760
done the working group is done some

461
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,080
working groups have lasted quite a long

462
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">period of time because every time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we get</font>

463
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,699
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> done something else gets new</font>

464
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:32,310
gets added to the dead to the thing but

465
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:36,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the things that are more focused</font>

466
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:39,990
this is a goal to get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> started go</font>

467
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:42,430
through the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get it done so</font>

468
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:45,210
give me a half second two graphs water

469
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,210
if you would please

470
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:55,299
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually really need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look</font>

471
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:57,039
to to know this but the guys who<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

472
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:59,799
solid dots are generally people are

473
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:03,669
involved in the running of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF or</font>

474
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:06,010
something along those lines so these

475
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:09,730
guys the green dot guys you should be

476
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:11,470
aware of um because they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ones</font>

477
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:15,460
who can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you with local stuff here</font>

478
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:16,660
they are involved in dealing with the

479
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:20,140
local<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and things along those</font>

480
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:21,970
life but almost any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these people can</font>

481
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:24,730
answer the question of where do i go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

482
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:26,020
find an answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay they may not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font>

483
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,780
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer the question but they can</font>

484
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:31,690
answer the question define the question

485
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:33,549
so keep these guys in mind these are the

486
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:35,049
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> people you want to talk to they</font>

487
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:38,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">generally know something about how the</font>

488
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:40,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">IETF is set up go talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to them first if</font>

489
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:43,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't in May cases they'll Brett</font>

490
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:45,639
they may drag you over to the the

491
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:49,720
Secretariat or something along those

492
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:51,730
lines so seeking the Secretariat there

493
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,870
are a number of organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

494
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:58,559
support and help the IETF most important

495
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:00,489
one are these guys the Secretariat

496
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,649
you're going to see the wandering<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

497
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:05,530
they've got secretary on the back black

498
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:13,299
shirts sorry I didn't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that um</font>

499
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:16,389
and they are key to our success they

500
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:18,280
have been intent in some cases I've laid

501
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:21,850
marshes been with us for 15 or 20 years

502
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:24,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">um they provide continuity they provide</font>

503
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:27,280
support for the organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

504
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:29,110
also and they're the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones who figure out</font>

505
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:35,440
how to get the meetings actually working

506
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:37,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hey iono if you are you don't need to</font>

507
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,650
know you don't necessarily need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

508
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,049
about this right now but<font color="#CCCCCC"> my guess is</font>

509
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:43,299
later on if you're writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> an internet</font>

510
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:45,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">draft or you're working in the process</font>

511
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:47,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">you will probably end up having to talk</font>

512
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:51,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">to them again they have office hours</font>

513
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:53,169
here there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> table</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up by registration</font>

514
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:55,330
they're nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> people go by they have</font>

515
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:58,630
candy it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful thing actually so does</font>

516
00:25:55,330 --> 00:26:01,449
the RFC utter our<font color="#CCCCCC"> C editor is response</font>

517
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:03,740
we're actually taking your miss formed

518
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:07,340
ideas and paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> and turn</font>

519
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:09,679
something that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciated any</font>

520
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,540

editors<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are involved in this</font>

523
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:19,640
process so again worthwhile to say hi

524
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:21,230
chat about what's going on if you are

525
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:29,840
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of wanting to publish</font>

526
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:33,520
something all good people um Heather is

<font color="#E5E5E5">Neville is about to leave he is the</font>

530
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:45,080
on the RFC series is<font color="#CCCCCC"> request for</font>

531
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:47,030
comments the reason is called that as

00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,860
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with some something</font>

can believe that it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> never really</font>

are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily IETF related but</font>

539

540
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:16,429
things that um are on the edge of what

541
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:18,980
the Iowa IETF wants to work on but we

542

don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to but aren't it isn't going</font>

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,340
noticed that already well I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

577

00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:41,480
correct location from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

590
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:43,280
information um it changes occasionally

591
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:47,299
and for some reason they don't put this

592
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:50,899
page up until almost until about now so

593
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:54,710
I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of guess at this um but we'll see</font>

00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:55,880
you leaning out there so one of the

other things you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see on the schedule</font>

596
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:01,010
is the I RTF this is the internet

interplanetary networks for example um

602

683
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:06,790
but sorry be aware<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this would</font>

684
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,319
normally be the end of the presentation

685
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:10,389

690
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:27,189
didn't I see you out there okay the IETF

691
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:29,139
runs the network in this hotel<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

692
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,970
entire time it's here unlike any other

693
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:32,500
conference I've seen we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

694
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:34,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">over the entire thing everything top to</font>

695
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,790
bottom belongs to us the only thing we

696
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:39,040
can't swap out or the eight are the

697
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:41,918
access points on the on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guest floors</font>

698
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,139
but the back end of it is we have a

699
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:47,469
network that is pretty much second to

700
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:52,629
none with respect to backhaul so you're

701

705
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:03,790
you're good to go the secure one like

00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:26,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting a response or in some cases</font>

767
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:51,680
um there is a survey there um my guess

768
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:54,410
is you will get another email saying if

770
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:59,240

771
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:03,380
please take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it um it's useful feedback</font>

772
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:05,779
um what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened last time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of</font>

773
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:09,500
amusing I and in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

774
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:12,050
problematic because I'd never<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a</font>

775
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:14,390
survey where they said is meaning too

776
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:18,560
long to short or just right and I got

777
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:20,600
nothing on the two long side so it's too

778
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,549
short just right so hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

783
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:39,799
my voice from from dying um I can answer

784

801
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:33,900
don't present stupid ideas you know

802
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:37,089
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I was just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> curious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

803
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,880
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of incidence rate is of companies</font>

804
00:39:37,089 --> 00:39:41,828
trying to push a stupid idea with the

805
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,240
attack and how where<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

806
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:45,009
countermeasures and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> often does this</font>

807
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">come up with the sensitivity level I</font>

808
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:51,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean um over the 30 years I've been</font>

809
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:53,589
doing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it about every two years</font>

810
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:56,980
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a you get a kind of an impulse</font>

811
00:39:53,589 --> 00:40:00,130
of those types of things um mostly it it

812
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:02,319
happens and it goes away occasionally we

813
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:06,910
get strange things like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITU versus</font>

814
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:10,960
the IETF with mpls or example but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

815
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:14,288
I I let me money let me say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

816
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:20,769
I don't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say you shouldn't bring</font>

817
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:24,910
up an<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea because sometimes sometimes</font>

818
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:27,640
just having that conversation about you

819
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:31,739
know is this and is this a stupid idea

820
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:33,730
is a useful thing for people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

821
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:36,190
presenting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing over and over</font>

822
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:37,630
as I think Einstein said for you know

823
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:39,900
doing the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> over again and</font>

824
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:42,220
expecting a different result is insanity

825
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,779
sometimes applies to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF and</font>

826
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,640
sometimes we just need to remember the

827
00:40:43,779 --> 00:40:46,989
history and sometimes you just need to

828
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,910
find the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the history we know</font>

829
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:51,390
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on about that so again</font>

830
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:54,970
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be afraid to bring an idea forward</font>

831
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:59,019
just be just be prepared to figure to

832
