<font color="#E5E5E5">alright good afternoon so during the</font>

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,339
next hour we're going to present<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:30,299
this is my<font color="#E5E5E5"> friend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> qu le a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Glee will do</font>

00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:33,979
the best to and return you so he's asked

8
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:36,090
question try to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it interactive I</font>

9
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:38,759
thought would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be better if we present</font>

10
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">from here we can have a look at the pc</font>

11
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:46,799
slightly to read the slides instead of

12
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:50,280
reading the screen so the thing with ops

13
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:54,090
is that it's divided into two logical

14
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:59,520
parts on one side<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have like how do we</font>

15
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:02,279
operate networks right with a best

16
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,380
practice was<font color="#E5E5E5"> network local deployment</font>

17
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:09,449
guidelines so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what your paraders</font>

18
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:11,220
are involved this is Joelle spot my part

19
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:15,079
and I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be starting with the first</font>

20
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:19,550
half an hour is on magic networks

21
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:22,890
typically protocols and data model

22
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:26,130
so you know we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> MIPS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MIT</font>

23
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,109
modules SNMP for some time we still do a

24
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,579
couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> write about a serene on</font>

25
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:37,230
writable read-only<font color="#E5E5E5"> MIT modules today</font>

26
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:39,840
just a few years so today we we focus on

27
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:42,619
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> yang modules or young models for</font>

28
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,540
configuration was that compadres<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font>

29
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:50,100
we've been doing strictly like flows

30
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:53,190
flow management with IP fix a working

31
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:56,600
group which is closed now we're doing

32
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:59,160
triple-a as well radius and diameter

33
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:03,359
Triple S stands for identification

34
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:06,410
authorization and accounting so we're

35
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,480
doing fault from Earth gaps fault

36
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:12,090
configuration accounting performance

37
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">even if I ppm is a transport working</font>

38
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:21,390
group and also security from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

39
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:24,660
operational point of view so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we heard</font>

40
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:29,190
that from the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we are</font>

41
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:33,030
friendlier than we look so and we're

42
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:36,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">quite good idea which is good here so</font>

43
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,680
typically if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you approach us we're kind</font>

44
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:47,400
of friendly so done is it a quiz

45
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:50,660
questions now so I mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps the</font>

46
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,459
apps area is operations and management

47
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,989
so typically what we have in the ITF is

48
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,530
that you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> people defining</font>

49
00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:01,790
specifications for technologies those

50
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:05,359
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not the one running networks</font>

51
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:08,220
so it's important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the operator</font>

52
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:13,980
feedback to say well this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

53
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:16,279
that we should deploy ipv6 or bgp so in

54
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:19,798
this case for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example at the bottom</font>

55
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:22,289
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nice there was a nice drawing</font>

56
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,359
its kind of word now so don't forget it

57
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:26,190
forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the drawing but basically</font>

58
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,010
we've got working group which is a

59
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:32,249
working group called IDR for bgp

60
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:35,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">protocol specification we've got another</font>

61
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:38,129
one which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> called secure ID are then</font>

62
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:40,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">whenever we take this into account and</font>

63
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:43,589
take the operator feedback coming from

64
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:47,189
the NOC network operator groups then it

65
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:49,379
feeds into typically an<font color="#CCCCCC"> apps working</font>

66
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:51,959
group grow which is about routing global

67
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:54,419
routing table and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is where</font>

68
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:57,509
would you find the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best run practice and</font>

69
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,829
the guidelines and then we go back into

70
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:01,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">the working group if we need to define</font>

71
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:09,360
something else right this is the

72
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:13,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">feedback loop yep now we'll be spending</font>

73
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,649
maybe 1 slide per working group

74
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:20,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">describing what we do in there what the</font>

75
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:24,509
hot topics are in one hour it's not like

76
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:28,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">a tutorial on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is an MP what is</font>

77
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:30,239
not come for this restaurant etc but we

78
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:32,759
were trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you pointers on what</font>

79
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:35,899
to pay attention to in working<font color="#CCCCCC"> groups</font>

80
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,909
specifically if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> participate</font>

81
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:41,509
so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the working groups for from</font>

82
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:45,360
joelle so typically is implicated

83
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:49,110
benchmarking<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS operations by routing</font>

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,559
operations multicast operational

85
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:55,849
security we<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned like cider</font>

86
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:58,679
operation for for pgp operation and ipv6

87
00:05:55,849 --> 00:06:01,409
v6 ops as we call it is quite an

88
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:04,638
important working group here it has been

89
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:09,449
for years it will be four<font color="#E5E5E5"> years I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guess</font>

90
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:14,369
now on my side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the house on the</font>

91
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:16,229
protocols and data models I got a couple

92
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:19,199
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> working groups and we're going to</font>

93
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:23,399
review them there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> netcom for that</font>

100
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:45,780
to define policies so I was quick don't

101
00:06:44,429 --> 00:06:50,520
worry I'll come back

102
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:52,739
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> one slide for a working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group what I</font>

103
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,770
want to show at the bottom here this my

104
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:59,730
key message is that we have four

105
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:03,299
different working groups that are in the

106
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:07,440
ops area but if you look there they're

107
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,510
not managed by any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us right typically</font>

108
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,350
they would be we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can move in my part of</font>

109
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:16,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">the house</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> endure the management so we've</font>

110
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:20,850
got the triple-a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones with diameter and</font>

111
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:24,060
with radius which is radius extension

112
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:29,400
radix we've got one on autonomic

113
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:31,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">networking anima and one on el map</font>

114
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:36,679
large-scale measurements of broadband

115
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:40,650
performance so why do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have ups</font>

116
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:43,350
working group not managed by the ops a

117
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:46,500
director it's not because we're just

118
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:49,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">lazy and we gave working group away we</font>

119
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:54,390
are lazy but that's a different story so

120
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:58,739
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happened two years ago</font>

121
00:07:54,390 --> 00:08:01,909
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> the iesg the internet internet</font>

122
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:06,180
Engineering steering group realized that

123
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:09,060
we would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of young models in</font>

124
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,800
the ITF sao yang models if you know

125
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,370
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> its end up in the past in the past</font>

126
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:18,510
had like mid modules with SNMP now we

127
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:22,289
have yang models with that count for us

128
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:24,539
come for configuration now since we

129
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:27,990
realize we would be we would see a

130
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:33,510
tsunami of young models coming and this

131
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:40,440
confirmed by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we ask for</font>

132
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:44,159
help and as a consequence I was asked to

133
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:48,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">refocus my time in the iesg mainly on</font>

134
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,970
young models<font color="#E5E5E5"> with more than 240 young</font>

135
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,430
models now across all working group in

136
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,080
the ITF that's a lot so what I've been

137
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing for the last two years is only</font>

138
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,670
focusing on on<font color="#CCCCCC"> yang and related</font>

139
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,000
protocols you'll see the couple of

140
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">working</font>

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,180
like I can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> I take care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of now it</font>

142
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:09,180
means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been having a couple of</font>

143
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:12,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">working groups that we gave away to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> non</font>

144
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:17,989
operational<font color="#E5E5E5"> area directors so the one I</font>

145
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:20,970
mentioned Triple A<font color="#CCCCCC"> l map and edema and</font>

146
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:24,870
what I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention the bottom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

147
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:29,940
is this edgy statement that we should

148
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:31,620
stop doing writable mid modules at some

149
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,470
point in time the past there was like

150
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,880
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every single working group</font>

151
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,100
should have a way to configure is

152
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,910
technologies with mid modules in

153
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:44,310
practice writable<font color="#E5E5E5"> MIT modules are not</font>

154
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:47,819
implemented there are difficult to

155
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:50,280
implement it<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs a lot and the new way</font>

156
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:57,480
to do that is with netcom for a scarf

157
00:09:50,280 --> 00:10:00,270
and yang now if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me yet</font>

158
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,300
that we've got many young modules in the

159
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:07,079
ITF this is like the dependency graph of

160
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:10,709
all the yang models it's the font<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

161
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,870
small on purpose because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

162
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,920
you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read every single yang mother's</font>

163
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:21,240
if you want I would be happy that you do

164
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:29,040
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is don't I'm trying to attract me</font>

165
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:31,740
sources here so okay please do and now

166
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,730
if you not convinced yet that we've got

167
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:39,360
many young models in the industry this

168
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:42,060
is the graph the issue we have right now

169
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that all these models the Camaro same</font>

170
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:49,170
time they should be working<font color="#E5E5E5"> together and</font>

171
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:53,880
we should slice them as soon as possible

172
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:57,180
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> justification why 180s to focus</font>

173
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,620
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> yang not only for ops but for all the</font>

174
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:03,000
working groups and we see many of those

175
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:05,970
young modules coming from a routing in

176
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,910
the ITF but also from broadband forum

177
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:15,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ice Italy open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> config</font>

179
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:28,799
yes ah this one I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to</font>

180
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:31,559
check I believe these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also the</font>

181
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:35,189
vendor specific one but now that I'm

182
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:37,919
thinking about I believe it's it still

183
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:39,988
looked nice if I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the vendor</font>

184
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:43,290
specific which are hundreds and hundreds

185
00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:45,209
so let me double check because if i put

186
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,819
the vendor specific to be just a black

187
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:49,799
search yeah that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the fully</font>

188
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:54,779
completed<font color="#E5E5E5"> Death Star as opposed to this</font>

189
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:57,089
one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is partially completed now the</font>

190
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:59,040
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the vendor specific one are</font>

191
00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:01,649
somehow in a different bucket because I

192
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,410
don't expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to work completely</font>

193
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:06,869
with the smart ones right either you go

194
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:09,749
with Stan out ways to configure models

195
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:12,059
or with native ones as we call them from

196
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:20,850
vendors and those are generated from

197
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:23,009
internal databases or or CLI etc<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I'm</font>

198
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:26,279
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you have been to</font>

199
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:30,569
many ITF meetings but maybe it's good to

200
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:33,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">take a minute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or two to review how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

201
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:37,069
look at working groups which documents

202
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:40,889
are covering and what the the topics are

203
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:43,498
so the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

204
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:45,649
tracker and in this example we're going

205
00:12:43,499 --> 00:12:48,480
to take a net count<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group and</font>

206
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:54,600
use it in the URL<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you've got another</font>

207
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:57,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">one for tools so typically you would</font>

208
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:01,760
have something like this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

209
00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:09,769
charter so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just stand up</font>

210
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:09,769
[Music]

211
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:18,019
alright so you see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tab over</font>

212
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:19,699
there this is what it gives you so if

213
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:21,589
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get any information from the</font>

214
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:23,659
chairs you've got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two email address</font>

215
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:25,969
from the chairs at this level the era

216
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:27,649
director the first thing you want to do

217
00:13:25,969 --> 00:13:31,819
maybe is subscribe to the mailing list

218
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:33,559
over there I like the dependency there

219
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:35,628
that shows you are all the different

220
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:37,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">documents are dependent on each other so</font>

221
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:40,459
if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be involved that's maybe</font>

222
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:42,769
one thing you want to do there is also

223
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:45,709
depending there the wiki or the issue

224
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:52,429
tracker which might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be different for</font>

225
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:54,768
documents now and maybe start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

226
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:57,348
looking at the Charter and at the bottom

227
00:13:54,769 --> 00:14:02,959
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter with milestones with what</font>

228
00:13:57,349 --> 00:14:04,609
the documents are yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and typically you</font>

229
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,339
would see like on the left hand side

230
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:10,519
documents then the last time it was

231
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:12,409
updated if<font color="#CCCCCC"> a document exists if it's a</font>

working<font color="#E5E5E5"> document if it's what is the</font>

233
00:14:12,409 --> 00:14:19,359

<font color="#E5E5E5">with share looking at a document to make</font>

236
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:39,609
sure it's complete before sending that

237
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:46,419
to the IDF rascal yep it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it oops</font>

238
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:46,419
burger<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so any questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so far</font>

239
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:52,819
it's all clear and you're going to

240
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:57,189
contribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ups and start writing</font>

241
00:14:52,819 --> 00:15:00,469
documents tonight this afternoon

242
00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:06,949
reviewing them is even better that's

243
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:10,279
right actually now let me go<font color="#CCCCCC"> one slide</font>

244
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:14,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">for working group the first one is not</font>

245
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:17,019
calm that stands for the question for

246
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:17,019
you

247
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:23,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">European pay attention thank you network</font>

248
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,440

249
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,410
provide the protocols to manage to

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,890
configure devices with<font color="#CCCCCC"> netconf and</font>

251
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:34,560

in the RFC Turk you just waiting to get

260
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:15,060
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got four drafts on that so since</font>

261
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,580
you won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be writing apps document you</font>

262
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:21,029
might want to review those right and

263
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:22,770
provide feedback we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on young</font>

restaurant was TLS ssh client server key

266

267
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:39,240
home so I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you both</font>

268
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,279
points on what we're working on to try

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:45,240
to get your<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest and quickly see the</font>

in the net mod one that's a net count

<font color="#E5E5E5">yang models in that working group now</font>

rotting young model the hot topics we've

288
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,450
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and i hope to get a lot of</font>

289
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:47,490
progress this week the first one is kima

290
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:51,540
mount that's a mechanism a mechanism to

291
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:56,810
combine yang modules into schema defined

292
00:17:51,540 --> 00:18:01,950
in other young modules well the ID is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

293
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:04,770
devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> I might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a VRS right routing</font>

294
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:08,280
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> it mean that I should define</font>

295
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:11,550
all my young models with a slash<font color="#CCCCCC"> vieira</font>

296
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:15,810
for the top maybe not because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've also</font>

297
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:17,909
have devices that don't have a vrf the

298
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:21,090
ID would be can I just take one part I

299
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:23,820
gang module and just mount it into a

300
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:26,610
different structure so going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to allow</font>

301
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:32,730
flexibility of integrating schema in

302
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:33,899
different yang modules now and by the

303
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got money young models</font>

304
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,760
depending on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific point the</font>

305
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,400
other one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a revised conceptual model</font>

306
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,040
for young<font color="#E5E5E5"> little stores the idea here is</font>

307
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:47,640
that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> moderators you would like</font>

308
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,950
to manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> their device differently by</font>

309
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,800
telling let me push a configuration<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

310
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:55,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">is my intended status internet</font>

311
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:58,200
configuration and I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen and</font>

312
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,960
regular basis if it's applied so

313
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,360
intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> were supply as opposed to not</font>

314
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,790
come for example which is I mean to<font color="#CCCCCC"> send</font>

315
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:10,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the config and wait until</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's applied</font>

316
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:12,060
now receive the okay to do that the idea

317
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,940
is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have two different views of the</font>

318
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:16,710
same data<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and apply that's what</font>

319
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,870
they're doing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that design team I'm</font>

320
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:27,560
hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a lot of progress on this</font>

321
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:30,929
one the lime lime working group layer

322
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:35,040
independent OEM management in the

00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:36,419
multi-layer environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

324
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,178
repeat that

325
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:42,809
the here independent OEM management in

326
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:45,779
the multi-layer environment there what

327
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:49,649
we're doing is that we realize that we

328
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:55,529
have many different oam mechanisms right

329
00:19:49,649 --> 00:19:58,668
and the goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to have young again</font>

330
00:19:55,529 --> 00:20:01,950
young models to have a consistent

331
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:05,929
configuration of the different OEM

332
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:10,499
mechanism a different sorry a consistent

333
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:12,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">reporting of the data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and consistent</font>

representation of the data if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would</font>

335
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:18,779
have that would be perfect regardless of

336
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">the OEM mechanism I have this super set</font>

337
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:24,090
of young models that we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> configure</font>

338
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:30,720
what's happening below<font color="#CCCCCC"> the status</font>

339
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:33,299
getting there I I hope that we won't be

340
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting at the next ITF in Chicago</font>

341
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:37,739
because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done so again</font>

342
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:45,299
that's a good place to provide feedback

343
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:52,289
on on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> document and thats a good</font>

344
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:58,220
reminder Greg that should be done small

345
00:20:52,289 --> 00:21:01,289
message so the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> super working group</font>

346
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:03,799
now you know in management what we

347
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:06,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">always like we want to monitor things</font>

348
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:10,408
but in terms of configuration there is

349
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:16,129
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> like policies if I see this</font>

350
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:18,960
traffic I need to block it if I see this

351
00:21:16,129 --> 00:21:22,019
traffic i'm going to read limited if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

352
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:26,119
see this specific security feature if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

353
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:30,720
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this entry it exact routing pass etc</font>

354
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:33,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">now the ID behind super simplified use</font>

355
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:38,090
of policy abstraction is to define the

356
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:43,169
policy construct the if-then statement

357
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:47,209
because most of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> yang modules will</font>

358
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:49,020
have those policies POS access lists

359
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:54,140
routing so

360
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:57,110
services you name it now in the Charter

361
00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:00,660
there is like the metric for success

362
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:02,729
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> one ever those policy construct</font>

363
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,190
defining this working group in yang

364
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:08,310
models will be reused by different

365
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:13,890
people right this is the metric versus

366
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:17,790
the metric for success now I mentioned

367
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:21,780
no intent which should be a cavity there

368
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:23,550
knowing no intent means that in this

369
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:27,710
working group we're not going to say i

370
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:32,610
want my network to behave like this and

371
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:35,220
the network just<font color="#E5E5E5"> behaves magically it's</font>

372
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:37,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">not part of this charter even if there</font>

373
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:42,420
was some interest to do so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would</font>

374
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:44,639
prefer to fix first if them scenario and

375
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:50,250
maybe later<font color="#CCCCCC"> on see if in 10 could be so</font>

376
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:53,670
diced<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to speak</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a concluded</font>

377
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:57,930
working group and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> closed it working</font>

378
00:22:53,670 --> 00:23:02,130
group just a couple of days<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago so it's</font>

379
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:08,730
a service yang model you know what the

380
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:13,530
service young model is all right what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

381
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:15,930
this well so you have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

382
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:20,100
particular facility that you've

383
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:22,410
described with this this model from

384
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:26,370
provisioning through operation and so on

385
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:28,530
and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular one is for layer</font>

386
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:30,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">three VPN but you could imagine serve</font>

387
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:36,440
with yang models for a firewall function

388
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:40,050
or for l2vpn or for a network overlay or

389
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:43,290
underlay or some kind of policy

390
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:46,110
enforcement mechanism very good unser

391
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:48,510
thank you for indirection so actually

392
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:52,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way I describe this is on top of</font>

393
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:55,230
what George said is we have two types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

394
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,850
service of young models<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one on the</font>

395
00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:00,380
network elements I want to configure

396
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:02,490
interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> vrf and access lists etc on</font>

397
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,770
specific devices

398
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:07,980
the service one typically will be in a

399
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:10,139
controller on a castrator saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

400
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,690
to have a service on top of different

401
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:14,760
devices in this case of a 3d i'm going

402
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:17,880
to configure the customer edge router

403
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:20,879
provider age rather age and consumer age

404
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:24,120
and then this service will have a great

405
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:28,080
apology and then by mean with the

406
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:31,229
orchestrator and controller that<font color="#CCCCCC"> nosy</font>

407
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:35,639
topology will go in different individual

408
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:38,250
devices right now a<font color="#CCCCCC"> capella another</font>

409
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:42,809
characteristic<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that those service</font>

410
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:46,950
models are done by operators because

411
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:50,070
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically an operator asking the</font>

412
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:54,360
question to his customer do you want to

413
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:56,040
have ipv4 and ipv6 what which routing do

414
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:00,090
you want to have within your siggy and

415
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:03,960
your PE with type of key OS now I mean

416
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:05,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">by this it's not like I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

417
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,400
in this service model all the

418
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:11,100
configuration knobs that the specific

419
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:18,360
device could do no just a question asked

420
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:22,199
by the operator to wis customer now<font color="#CCCCCC"> l to</font>

421
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:27,928
sm is basically an three sm which is

422
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:34,170
closed for an l2vpn this time so same

423
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:38,850
thing questianus<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 will gather to the</font>

424
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:48,150
sem<font color="#CCCCCC"> our metric unit swarms of is it to</font>

425
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:49,750
have their service model amia and yes so

426
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:54,130
this model

427
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:56,380
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> we care how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is so the question</font>

428
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">who repeat this with recording is what</font>

429
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,310
is interaction with em EF which has got

430
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,129
also some service models yes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

431
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:05,110
discussed the MAF once you have an

432
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:09,850
architecture with different building

433
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:13,330
blocks there for a service for customer

434
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:15,639
database for billing for all this and

435
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:16,899
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with em EF on this</font>

436
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,420
so we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been reviewing what they're</font>

437
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,160
doing we're also reviewing I'm believing

438
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:24,670
that in the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> of service model it</font>

439
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:27,100
will be somehow difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nervous</font>

440
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:30,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're not going to have that many</font>

441
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:33,310
service model solid eyes very couple of

442
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">them I start to see new service model</font>

443
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:37,659
all the times now the approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

444
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,399
different between the ITF and em EF in

445
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,440
the ITF we want to have a self-contained

446
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:52,930
model and the MAF once you have the

447
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:57,520
floor architecture so L to sm is<font color="#CCCCCC"> brand</font>

448
00:26:52,930 --> 00:27:13,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">new it now the first meeting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes and I</font>

449
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:15,190
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be quick yes so you have a</font>

450
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:17,460
situation where you may have a

451
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:22,570
multi-vendor environment but you're also

452
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:24,670
stepping up from from say<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of</font>

453
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:28,419
bare metal interface configuration to

454
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:33,730
the abstraction<font color="#E5E5E5"> ie what I'm provisioning</font>

455
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:35,860
is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> l2 VPN service and um so we</font>

456
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,990
described that to a control work menu

457
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:41,290
controller goes off with the device or

458
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:45,390
interface models and actually takes that

459
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:47,340
abstraction and has to implement that

460
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:49,210
mechanically which means producing

461
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:52,840
configuration essentially for these

462
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:55,720
devices that are involved so you want to

463
00:27:52,840 --> 00:28:00,159
step away from the vendor specific

464
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:02,380
notion of of how this thing actually

465
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,240
gets configured to

466
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:08,230
sort of higher level abstraction that

467
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:13,080
describes the features of it that are

468
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:15,280
that are required for provisioning

469
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,470
typically you would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking something</font>

470
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,930
like okay I want you have a GF service

471
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:22,600
gold<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to define</font>

472
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:25,510
specifically oh I want you to QQ death

473
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,070
of X nothing to discuss<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with your</font>

474
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:29,770
customer on the line right you're going

475
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:31,210
to say which one do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want that's what</font>

476
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:37,090
about abstraction that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're speaks</font>

477
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:38,710
about it no it's not in a structure

478
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,209
itself it's just like different

479
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:56,770
positioning on top of a controller

480
00:28:40,210 --> 00:29:03,840
orchestrator for multiple devices yes so

481
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:08,620
how it applies to mention as a cadet or

482
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:12,040
deserve mapping of the divots that is

483
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:15,820
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> war in the Africa scope because</font>

484
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:21,909
there's go on chief so would that be

485
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:28,960
didn't scope for<font color="#E5E5E5"> to SF or scope ye</font>

486
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:31,210
rather I don't think so but I don't I I

487
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,460
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> l2 sm will go into</font>

488
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:36,760
it and with some well not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to the</font>

489
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:42,970
SLA maybe you want to go to the mic if

490
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:46,900
it's a long long comment yeah one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

491
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:49,090
points of the MAF is that they specify

492
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:52,390
the service they don't specify how its

493
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:55,389
implemented for example for ITF that

494
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:59,080
will be whether it's a VPN or<font color="#CCCCCC"> its V POS</font>

495
00:29:55,390 --> 00:30:01,180
to the wires that might be part of the

496
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:04,179
model but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would not be a definitely</font>

497
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:12,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of the MAF model because for them</font>

498
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:14,110
it's a line or EV PL or III<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty</font>

499
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,480
important for these industries to be

500
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:17,310
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to describe the</font>

501
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,130
product that they're delivering in a

502
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:21,990
relatively coherent fashion so that we

503
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:26,520
all agree that we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

504
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:30,260
thing and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's um that's where</font>

505
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:34,980
sort of these higher level on constructs

506
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:38,690
come from yeah but it didn't desire for

507
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:43,460
what I wonder is that I would again

508
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:46,260
would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> L to sm will have</font>

509
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:48,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">define the mechanism with implements</font>

510
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:51,690
there to service whether it will say

511
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:55,530
okay we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> EVP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> n and here's you can go</font>

512
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:58,500
into their EVP and data model and it

513
00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:01,320
will address your concern or<font color="#E5E5E5"> will say we</font>

514
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:04,230
use vpls and then you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the POS</font>

515
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:08,010
data model and it provides you how to

516
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:12,960
build<font color="#CCCCCC"> their to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service so in a charter</font>

517
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:15,840
we said to the wire<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't you could</font>

518
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,260
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> not of those things it's not EVP and</font>

519
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,850
then I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinions in there as well</font>

520
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:24,090
yeah I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> it could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a lot of those</font>

521
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:26,939
things like pseudowire covers a whole

522
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:32,720
bunch of technologies either in the ITF

523
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:36,780
or elsewhere so would then that these

524
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:39,620
models of this specific technology to

525
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:46,170
instantiate the layer to service be

526
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:50,429
exposed in l2 sm so we sent a charter on

527
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:53,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">Frankie access said that I can that it</font>

528
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:56,760
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be based on the pseudowire and an</font>

529
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,650
ED p.m. if i'm not mistaken but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

530
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:03,330
like a configuration of those those two

531
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:11,730
it's based on let's review the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter</font>

532
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:13,230
text<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and if you recall I've got</font>

533
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:16,710
four there are four different working

534
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:19,680
groups that are not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in ops but</font>

535
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:22,350
not much by ops so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be quick on</font>

536
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,330
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to mention the of the</font>

537
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:26,820
rectory that's a group of expert in ops

538
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:29,189
we could help you've got an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ops issue</font>

539
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,990
but also what they're doing is that

540
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:34,590
they're reviewing all the working

541
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:36,920
documents at IDF last call so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

542
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:39,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">the upstair Directorate you can also</font>

543
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:42,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">send them directly request if you've got</font>

544
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:46,350
any any questions and you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got like</font>

545
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:48,300
some more Directorate for<font color="#CCCCCC"> young doctors</font>

546
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:51,030
with doctors if you get like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a yang</font>

547
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:54,409
module or mid module at IDF last hole

548
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:58,139
they need to review this this document

549
00:32:54,410 --> 00:33:01,590
from a young<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of view from SMI</font>

550
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:03,450
point of view which is the language<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

551
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:05,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">not specifically if you're managing your</font>

552
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:07,320
technology right because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult</font>

553
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:09,330
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> an expert in management but also</font>

554
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,629
on the technologies technology

555
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:17,960
themselves right so let's pretend that

556
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:21,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to manage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x.25 good example</font>

557
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,860

enough on my next meeting even if at you

00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:14,670
I can answer any questions oh I can make

574
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:17,040
stuff up certainly good at that all

right I thank you good so then why I

576
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,159
talked over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the management side of</font>

577
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:28,889
things I have the ops in operations and

578
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:30,989
management so um ITF areas are typically

579
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:35,210
organized around particular lines of

580
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:38,189
work um so routing internet transport

581
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:39,840
applications real-time applications was

582
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:42,810
a separate area for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> while and it's</font>

583
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:45,210
been folded back into

584
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:49,230
into the general application in real

585
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:52,530
time area and even management protocols

586
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:55,290
on operations however is kind of a meta

587
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:57,270
area in the sense that it actually

588
00:34:55,290 --> 00:35:03,150
touches a whole bunch of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other areas</font>

589
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:05,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">um and the general rubric of that is</font>

590
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:12,210
network operators used to be a somewhat

591
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:16,290
more on general purpose entity if you

592
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:18,660
worked at compu server AOL or an entity

593
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:20,850
like that you had a tendency to have

594
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:25,100
operations in sort of all of the areas

595
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:27,990
and as networks have become more

596
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:30,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">application specific whereas they've</font>

597
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:34,819
fallen out into transport and services

598
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:37,020
and eyeball networks and so on

599
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:38,790
operations has tended to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a little</font>

600
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit more diffuse and divided up into</font>

601
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:43,080
into more specific groups on the

602
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:47,520
operations area and the ITF still

603
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:49,380
touches all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them however um so</font>

604
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:54,710
largely we're concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

605
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:56,660
operation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of IETF protocols um there are</font>

606
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:58,920
there is overlap with other

607
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:03,379
organizations so we occasionally have

608
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:07,350
liaisons for example with I Triple E or

609
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:11,820
3gpp related to particular lines of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

610
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:15,450
in the ITF and particularly<font color="#CCCCCC"> in relation</font>

611
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:19,380
to the operation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of say the ipv6</font>

612
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:23,700
protocol or cap web extensions to I

00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:28,860
Triple E 802<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot11 our places where we</font>

614
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:30,750
are outwardly facing so the ITF didn't

615
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:33,480
start with an<font color="#CCCCCC"> operations area</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

616
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:37,020
actually sort of evolved out of a need

617
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:40,650
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a place to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do work for working</font>

618
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:44,240
groups where the actual protocol

619
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:46,680
development was actually completed or

620
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,899
largely completed and in in a

621
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,000
maintenance mode<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sharing in</font>

622
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,520
coordination with operators is a

623
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,610
necessary part of protocol utilization

624
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,050
so just because

625
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:01,620
the IDF thinks they're done with

626
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:04,920
something doesn't mean that it is

627
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:08,069
actually particularly easy to operate or

628
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,810
that we don't benefit benefit from

629
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:12,080
sharing the insights of operators back

630
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:16,340
with the developers of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these protocols</font>

631
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:18,960
so operations tries to fill<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hole</font>

632
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:23,010
the big<font color="#E5E5E5"> places that we do that the sort</font>

633
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,390
of top line on divisions among the

634
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:27,620
working groups tend to be routing

635
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:31,710
coordination security coordination

636
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:37,799
measurement arm and so on but we also

637
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:39,630
catch a few other things um operations

638
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,700
working groups typically do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not do</font>

639
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:47,250
protocol development so there are

640
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:51,259
exceptions to that but in general we do

641
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:57,300
not do maintenance on existing protocols

642
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:59,400
with exceptions four elements in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

643
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,540
that are largely operationally focused

644
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:06,450
like new resource record types um

645
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:09,630
coordination<font color="#CCCCCC"> with protocols developers</font>

646
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:11,580
is a lot simpler in areas where<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

647
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:14,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">are active working groups doing work so</font>

648
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:17,549
inter domain routing for example has a

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:21,620
as a in the in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> routing area has an</font>

652
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:32,759

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things span decades because we</font>

655
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:44,520
don't get to just declare victory and go

656
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:46,530
home in some cases um and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of</font>

657
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:50,180
what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsibility of an area</font>

659
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:59,819
to judge where there are critical levels

660
00:38:54,330 --> 00:39:03,120
of activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> and or kill off areas where</font>

661
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:05,640
we're no longer doing a good job<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

662
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:08,009
where we lack critical mass or interest

663
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,410
for the ITF to still be engaged in those

664
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:12,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">activities but some</font>

665
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:16,069
activity levels are cyclical so

666
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:21,660
protocols will go through periodic

667
00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:24,480
demand for a change or usable input and

668
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:27,899
then the level<font color="#CCCCCC"> activity will drop off</font>

669
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,460
again for a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of years so that</font>

670
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">means we have to not be afraid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

671
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:34,079
charter new work just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it might</font>

672
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:36,868
not work out sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to make</font>

673
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:44,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">working groups dormant and then find new</font>

674
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:44,329
chairs when the level activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> works up</font>

675
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:51,299
there is a tendency among operators to

676
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:57,089
think of protocol developers as some

677
00:39:51,299 --> 00:40:00,960
form of subhuman it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of important</font>

678
00:39:57,089 --> 00:40:05,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">to not make the operator a developer</font>

679
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:10,619
relationship in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> us-versus-them act</font>

680
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:14,819
kind of stance and we try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintain</font>

681
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:17,520
that in in the operations area in many

682
00:40:14,819 --> 00:40:21,859
cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the participants in the</font>

683
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:23,940
working group and and the authors of

684
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:27,450
documents come from both sides of the

685
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:31,230
fence<font color="#E5E5E5"> so developers come here um because</font>

686
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:32,759
they need feedback and operators and

687
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:35,849
consumers come here because they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

688
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:38,069
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and because they have ideas on</font>

689
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:44,670
how things can improve so we try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do</font>

690
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:46,740
this together so on the ITF operations

691
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:50,460
area I think serves an important

692
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:54,419
function and this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key</font>

693
00:40:50,460 --> 00:41:00,720
focuses of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Operations Directorate in</font>

694
00:40:54,420 --> 00:41:05,579
in performing review is to look at other

695
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:07,890
ITF work with a with an eye towards its

696
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:10,470
operation and management considerations

697
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:13,288
so this comes up in the charter of for

698
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:15,868
example new working<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups so something</font>

699
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:17,520
that is very important right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

700
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:21,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">terms of IETF activities was the</font>

702
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:29,490

703
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:32,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> http/2 is done there is a</font>

704
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:34,589
significant amount of interest and

705
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:38,730
effort looking at the quick protocol and

706
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:40,140
one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we as operators</font>

707
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:45,240
are concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about with the quick</font>

708
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:48,470
protocol is a the potential for loss of

709
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:51,359
visibility into things like flows<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

710
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:55,410
that are necessary for the operation of

711
00:41:51,360 --> 00:42:00,570
devices like firewalls on for IP flow

712
00:41:55,410 --> 00:42:02,700
export to work properly and for us to

713
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:06,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">have visibility into traffic on our</font>

714
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:11,399
networks so we review the quick charter

715
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:15,060
um and we get some text added which I

716
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:18,840
think uh actually speaks to the

717
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:22,590
manageability of the IP protocols in

718
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:24,090
general and is maybe a feature of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

719
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:28,070
but was not<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a design</font>

720
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:30,600
consideration back in the early 80s so

721
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:34,320
there's this been a significant amount

722
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:38,130
of work in the area of how do we provide

723
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:43,470
guidelines on to protocol developers on

724
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:45,420
what operational issues are and um how

725
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:48,450
management should be done in the rest of

726
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:52,500
the ITF so you can see in then was

727
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:56,250
efforts around yang on that effort

728
00:42:52,500 --> 00:43:02,940
bearing fruit<font color="#E5E5E5"> because um operators do</font>

729
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:05,670
need tools in this space so it was no

730
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:09,510
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> sufficient in the IETF to just do</font>

731
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:11,960
protocols and not do management

732
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:15,150
interfaces for example for them um

733
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,460
because the operator community has to

734
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:20,820
knit all these pieces together um and

735
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:22,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">that becomes harder over time don't look</font>

736
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:26,460
at the current set of working groups

737
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:29,940
that we have we're actually going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

738
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:32,010
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these real</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quick um so we</font>

739
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,260
can just go into that benchmark

740
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:36,950
methodology working group I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font>

741
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:39,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the oldest working group that I have</font>

742
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:42,500
um currently it's been operational since

743
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:44,930
1989 it was started by a guy named Scott

744
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:47,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">Brandner who many of you might be</font>

745
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:50,980
familiar with but at Harvard he had a

746
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:55,820
thing called<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Brandner lab which did</font>

747
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:58,490
ethernet switch benchmarking and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh</font>

748
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:03,880
he brought a great deal of levity and

749
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:06,259
sanity to UM the measurement of

750
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:14,420
forwarding performance in routers and

751
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:18,940
switches and um yep um well being in the

752
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:22,369
window side and being<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in</font>

753
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:25,130
prepping their box to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> burner lab</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

754
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:27,680
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some interesting history what</font>

755
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:30,230
lenders did to get the numbers oh yes

756
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:34,779
absolutely that's actually why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder</font>

757
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:37,099
is just your opinion ah how much value

758
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:41,569
operators put in the benchmarking

759
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:44,000
numbers so I think in this way and this

760
00:44:41,569 --> 00:44:46,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually speaks to sort of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ITF as</font>

761
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,849
not being Internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> Protocol police I</font>

762
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:53,000
think what benchmarking methodology gave

763
00:44:49,849 --> 00:44:55,849
us was common language to describe the

764
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:01,089
properties of things so I have a

765
00:44:55,849 --> 00:45:01,089
tendency<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not have a tendency to not</font>

766
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:07,160
take seriously numbers that I see

767
00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:08,540
published in magazines because the

768
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:13,700
circumstances under<font color="#CCCCCC"> which they are</font>

769
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:15,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">created obviously have a you know can be</font>

770
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:20,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">viewed with some suspicion on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

771
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:22,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">hand I can use the language that the ITF</font>

772
00:45:20,089 --> 00:45:25,849
has given me and that the tools that

773
00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:28,940
benchmarking methodology gave me to

774
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:31,520
compare the performance of devices and

775
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:34,400
at least talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about when they deviate</font>

776
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:39,140
from my expectations for example what it

777
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:43,849
was that actually happened so you know

778
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:45,500
obviously as vendors and I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

779
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:47,990
worked at a firewall vendor so I have

780
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,850
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> direct experience with say TCP I</font>

781
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:54,020
mix performance

782
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:58,310
funding<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I think we could say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

783
00:45:54,020 --> 00:46:00,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">vendors that like um and as consumers of</font>

784
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:02,900
this technology that that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

785
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:05,570
have real value because if they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

786
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:07,880
making it up themselves it would be even

787
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:14,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'd be even worse off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than we then we</font>

788
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:16,100
are now so um and I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> this gets this</font>

789
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,200
has continued to<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolve there are all</font>

790
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:20,930
sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that people care about</font>

791
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:23,419
performance aspects of not just

792
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:28,270
forwarding performance um so router

793
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:32,090
convergence for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example are things where</font>

794
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:34,190
it's helpful to be able to do to come to

795
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:38,300
have a common language to describe them

796
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:42,290
and the RFC series through BMW<font color="#E5E5E5"> G in the</font>

797
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:45,890
last 30 years has actually done a pretty

798
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:47,840
I think decent job there and it of

799
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:49,580
course covers things other than routing

800
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,030
and forwarding performance so sip

801
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:54,380
traffic management neighbor discovery

802
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:59,650
virtual network functions are all things

803
00:46:54,380 --> 00:47:03,950
that have been done there um<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS up um</font>

804
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:06,130
so we essentially have two working

805
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:09,410
groups where lots of DNS work was done

806
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:11,860
dns xed which was<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns extensions and</font>

807
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:15,040
that was in the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> area and dns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> op</font>

808
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:18,530
which had a tendency to handle a

809
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:22,730
behavioral changes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns operators</font>

810
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:25,580
wanted um now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have one so we</font>

811
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:28,250
have dns<font color="#E5E5E5"> op and so that actually</font>

812
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:30,950
simplifies things a little in other ways

813
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:37,850
it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it more complex this is another</font>

814
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:41,509
place where outward-looking arm outreach

815
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:44,299
efforts are done so for example um the

816
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:48,050
ITF has a responsibility for the

817
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:51,680
technical operation of the root zone not

818
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:55,250
for the done for the contents of it or

819
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:59,450
the management of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> things get in or</font>

820
00:47:55,250 --> 00:48:01,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">out and so that that puts us in an</font>

821
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:03,419
interesting position with respect to

822
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:07,770
managing

823
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:09,690
darpa where the reverse zone is and the

824
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:14,910
community around that is organized

825
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:17,369
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> provides an</font>

826
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:21,420
interface for other constituencies they

827
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:25,579
can come<font color="#CCCCCC"> here arm and work with the ITF</font>

828
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:31,680
on the technical problems associated

829
00:48:25,579 --> 00:48:35,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">with this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> area grow is global routing</font>

830
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:38,790
operations um and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this essentially</font>

831
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:41,309
exists as a companion to IDR in the

832
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:43,920
routing area and it documents issues and

833
00:48:41,309 --> 00:48:50,630
operational practices with BGP routing

834
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:56,549
table size<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP interaction security and</font>

835
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:59,190
VPNs and it works on best practices for

836
00:48:56,549 --> 00:49:00,690
configuration and problem statements so

837
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:02,880
for example if you see something about

838
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:05,119
route flap dampening being considered

839
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:10,140
harmful it probably came through grow

840
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:12,329
right route flap<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ralph lab dampening is</font>

841
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:14,250
of course not an ietf technology it was

842
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:16,500
a vendor specific implementation which

843
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:20,480
everyone slavishly copy copied from

<font color="#E5E5E5">cisco because it actually you know does</font>

845
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,049
essentially what it was intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

846
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:27,750
which was reduce cpu utilization on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

848
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:33,660
it safe and so that's a place<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

849
00:49:31,049 --> 00:49:37,470
operators I'm provided feedback to

850
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:45,868
implementers through the grow working

851
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:49,859
group on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> M Bundy contrary to some</font>

852
00:49:45,869 --> 00:49:51,780
people's expectations a multicast

853
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:55,740
routing actually still has a quite a

854
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:58,799
viable life span even if it's not even

855
00:49:55,740 --> 00:50:03,439
if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the interdomain promise of</font>

856
00:49:58,799 --> 00:50:06,990
the early 90s for multicast routing so

857
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:11,640
that work is coordinated among operators

858
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:14,069
on and it also has a companion routing

859
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:15,420
working group which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the pim working</font>

860
00:50:14,069 --> 00:50:19,570

861
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:22,840
um operations in management area this is

862
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:27,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">an important working group it's our</font>

863
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:30,760
catch-all working group so uh the ops

864
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:34,480
AWG and operations area of meetings<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

865
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:36,490
code joined on we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> chairs here we</font>

866
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:44,140
have a sufficiently broad enough charter

00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:47,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can um take on operations work</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">on some unrelated technologies the other</font>

874
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:08,590
thing that we do there is a maintenance

875
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:12,460
of legacy arm management components so

876
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:15,070
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> mibs that need to go away or</font>

877
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:16,780
get mark historical or deprecated and

878
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:20,200
things that might potentially be

879
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:22,810
dangerous that we should that we should

880
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:25,629
get rid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of from the IETF protocol</font>

881
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:31,930
specifications occasionally come there

882
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:36,430
um um and things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> mibs that might be</font>

883
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:38,169
informational that don't justify

884
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:39,910
spinning up a dedicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group</font>

885
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:41,110
tend to get house there so that meeting

00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:43,029
can actually be interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

887
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:45,990
smorgasbord but it's also a place where

888
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:48,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">you might potentially bring work if you</font>

00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:51,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have an idea where it actually</font>

890
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:55,270
should go and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually good</font>

891
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:57,850
place a good opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

892
00:51:55,270 --> 00:52:01,270
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working group chairs or the</font>

893
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:04,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">area directors about whether um the</font>

operations<font color="#E5E5E5"> in management area a working</font>

895
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:12,040
group is a the right place to put work

896
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:16,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">OPSEC does essentially the same thing</font>

897
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:18,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">except</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for security specific work um and</font>

898
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:21,850
it develops recommendations and best

899
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:25,380
practices for the operation of things

900
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:28,750
like control plane police ears or

901
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:33,280
control plane ACLs or default fire

902
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:36,430
postures things like that cider ops is

903
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:39,760
actually newly charter this is my first

904
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:44,230
new working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group in a year um and it</font>

905
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:46,390
essentially takes son arm the remaining

906
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:48,400
work of the cider working group as that

907
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:52,420
is closing down because it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> completed</font>

908
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:55,120
the core specification for cider um so

909
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:57,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">inter-domain routing again in the</font>

910
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:59,560
internet area is sort of a companion to

911
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">this in the sense that that's where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp</font>

912
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:09,060
sec protocol work is going on right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

913
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:12,610
um but now that we have is have a cider

914
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:15,100
specification arm the operation of

915
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:18,820
secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter-domain routing and the rpki</font>

916
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:20,529
is going to be a thing that is quite

917
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:22,660
involved as far as deployment goes

918
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:27,360
because it has a number of constituent

919
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:33,819
parties and its operation has not yet

920
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:35,710
matured significantly so you know we

921
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:38,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">needed a place where that stuff could</font>

922
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:40,960
cook oh and so it starts<font color="#CCCCCC"> within a whole</font>

923
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:44,470
stable of documents in sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

924
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:47,290
intermediate stages related to the

925
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:54,160
operation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of various components</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

926
00:53:47,290 --> 00:54:00,220
rpki and finally we have v6 ops and this

927
00:53:54,160 --> 00:54:02,649
exists as a companion to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

928
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:04,390
area group<font color="#CCCCCC"> six-man which does the</font>

929
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:08,830
protocol maintenance for the ipv6

930
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:11,080
protocol stack and this does this

931
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:14,529
concerns itself with the operations and

932
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:19,210
deployment of ipv6 networks and so

933
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:21,720
that's what it's focused on and finally

934
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:27,820
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> means we've made it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the end here</font>

935
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:31,149
in good time so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a survey and</font>

936
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:33,850
i'll leave this slide up for a little

937
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:36,400
bit if you want it but it's also in the

938
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:38,860
set of slides um and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

939
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,960
agenda so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to offer us</font>

940
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:42,250
feedback that's usable d 8 for the

941
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">education</font>

942
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:47,950
the edu team they can't get rid of<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

943
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:50,350
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm an area director but it</font>

944
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:54,939
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful to them to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

945
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:57,580
was useful for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

946
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:59,620
questions you can either<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring him to</font>

947
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:07,650
the mic or bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to me directly</font>

948
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:07,650
once we close this down cool thank you

949
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:33,280
know yeah yeah we can we can do that um

950
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:36,370
this one is also this one will also be

951
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:39,540
online if it's not already click yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

952
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:39,540
