your new co-chair Martin thanks to John

11
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:39,820
who did a lot for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> group blue sheets</font>

12
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:44,560
are running if there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> volunteer</font>

13
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:47,408
for Jabbar or mini taking that would be

14
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,659
really welcome and just to let you know

15
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:53,380
also that we might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a virtual queue</font>

16
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:55,899
I don't know somebody's there but it's

17
00:01:53,380 --> 00:02:01,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a crowded meeting so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font>

18
00:01:55,899 --> 00:02:05,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to manage so working hope progress</font>

19
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:09,119
if I may call that<font color="#E5E5E5"> poor guys we don't</font>

20
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any new RFC since the last meeting</font>

21
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:16,040
we've managed to close only<font color="#CCCCCC"> two out of</font>

22
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:18,930
seven working hopeless calls

23
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,519
strictly speaking these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not fully</font>

24
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,430
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> call at schools they also</font>

25
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,340
include IPR codes that well done that

26
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,950
have been done separately and prior to

27
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">the last call but nevertheless it's part</font>

28
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,560
of the same face so two out of seven

29
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:44,430
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> oblast goals and only one out of</font>

30
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:46,980
three adoptions so well that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> bogus in</font>

31
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,190
a certain way but I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like</font>

32
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:55,200
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change so that we have better</font>

33
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:58,079
figures next meeting so reminder on our

34
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,589
objective that the working group has a

35
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,770
grade on is to push as a whole these<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

36
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:09,960
working of documents the architecture

37
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:14,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">and three use cases so as a whole and as</font>

38
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:18,180
soon as possible but we've lost

39
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:21,060
considerable amount of time since<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

40
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:25,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">last meeting by doing IPR polls</font>

41
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:28,800
separately to working gelaskins so we

42
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,780
could have done them jointly but the

43
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,780
delay comes from the fact that after

44
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,330
three months we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all the</font>

45
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:41,550
answers from all the others on the floor

46
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:44,070
documents that were polled you might see

47
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:47,000
that so we have to which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know we have</font>

48
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:50,100
won only one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in good shape</font>

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,140
strictly speaking it's to the resiliency

50
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:59,579
a use case we managed to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's in</font>

51
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:05,670
orange because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last answer came in</font>

52
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:07,470
like less than a week ago and but to

53
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:10,380
address that point we we had to run

54
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:12,750
after that person until I in fact we

55
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:16,709
ended up removing him from the list of

56
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:19,709
authors so be aware<font color="#CCCCCC"> that something like</font>

57
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:23,099
that could happen and<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

58
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:27,210
architecture I think we've received<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

59
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,620
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> missing IPR answer two days ago so</font>

60
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,229
it's orange it's green

61
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:35,040
but I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to emphasize that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

62
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:38,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">latest answers came in very recently for</font>

63
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:42,240
the ipv6 were still missing some answers

64
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:46,590
and we have to work in go class<font color="#CCCCCC"> call to</font>

65
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:50,130
go the target that I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to set is</font>

66
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:54,270
that we we press the button to send

67
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:57,630
these documents to iesg before while in

68
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:00,330
one month before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christmas period so</font>

69
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:06,900
i will really expect everyone to work on

70
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:10,800
that for the other working of documents

71
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:13,679
so no change since<font color="#E5E5E5"> Berlin for these four</font>

72
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,830
and they are ready for a working go

73
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,229
classical and here again I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to set</font>

74
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:25,099
quite an aggressive target is to have

75
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:28,770
only sent ysg before chicago but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

76
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:32,880
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the top three document that went</font>

77
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:37,760
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> i pr</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> polls is missing IP answers</font>

78
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:42,169
it was three out of three a few days ago

79
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:45,270
so the situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> as he also improved</font>

80
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:47,729
because of a recent warning that worse

81
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:50,280
that was sent to only authors that they

82
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:55,550
could simply disappear from the draft if

83
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,549
they failed to answer in a timely manner

84
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,930
few other working of documents two of

85
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,900
them are on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agenda so i won't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speak</font>

86
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,440
through them we have the OEM

87
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:14,460
requirements and mpls anycast segments

88
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,650
which has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> recently adopted adoption</font>

89
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,549
calls so not much difference here

90
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:23,789
compared to working or glass goals the

91
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:28,289
level of support and interest expressed

92
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:32,310
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list is quite questionable and so</font>

93
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:34,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will really like this to change and we</font>

94
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,460
have also the same IP I issue we're

95
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,340
still missing IP answers on large-scale

96
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:43,520
interconnect for the early cursing info

97
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:51,210
as defined

98
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:53,430
we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it today so we have</font>

99
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,289
some laughs we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are which are Conda late</font>

100
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">for work and go bad option</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the sense</font>

101
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:00,600
that the authors have informed us that

102
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:07,020
they would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us to do a poll for</font>

103
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:11,240
adoption situation we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in today leads</font>

104
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:14,609
us to prefer clearing the situation

105
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:19,940
before adopting new document it's not an

106
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:25,020
absolute rule but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very likely one</font>

107
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:31,440
at least over the next three months I'd

108
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:34,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">say so a conclusion on that we have a</font>

109
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:39,870
challenging<font color="#CCCCCC"> old map ahead for documents</font>

111
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:48,060
other one before chicago so i would

112
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:51,390
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> i really expect the authors to be</font>

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,810
extremely reactive both<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in answering</font>

114
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:58,740
the IPR polls but also in addressing the

115
00:07:54,810 --> 00:08:01,530
comments that will pop up during the

116
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:04,980
during the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rascals and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the working group</font>

117
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:09,150
itself to feel concern and review those

118
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:11,040
documents to make sure that in the pace

119
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:13,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">that will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be working at is not</font>

120
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:21,120
detrimental to the quality<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

121
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:24,720
document that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to submit this is</font>

122
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:30,780
the agenda it has been re-worked a bit

123
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:33,870
but not drastically and an update<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

124
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:38,299
is not shown here is that Stefan will

125
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:43,799
take half an hour to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> younger</font>

126
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:48,800
because he has so many things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say 15</font>

127
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,800
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> um less</font>

128
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:03,390
so is there actually an update on the

129
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:09,060
segment<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing architecture draft in</font>

130
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:14,210
this session no<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we get an</font>

131
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:14,209
update on what's expected in version 10

132
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:24,839
version 10 is under review between the

<font color="#CCCCCC">author's 18</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two grades a couple of</font>

other small editorial changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully</font>

143
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,439

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we need the HR lb is not</font>

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,440
something essential to the architecture

146
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:12,980
it's a small<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP extension just to</font>

147
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,260
advertise a label range to a controller

148
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,900
so it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> impact in any way the</font>

149
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:22,340
architecture so no need for changing for

150
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,340
changes in the architecture

151
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:35,550
thank you for that clarification<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

152
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,589
was no dedicated slot for that because

153
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,120
it could have been addressed either on

154
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:47,640
the list or buying that simple

155
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:51,300
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm les Ginsburg my</font>

157
00:10:51,300 --> 00:11:02,279

00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:05,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh this draft has been</font>

159
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:08,430
progressing I guess for about a year I'd

160
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,830
like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're getting close to the</font>

161
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,949
resolution but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some important</font>

162
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,209
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do want to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about today</font>

163
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:19,740
just a quick summary why are we doing

164
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:24,359
this because you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> distributed</font>

165
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:28,050
configuration of SIDS and it's possible

166
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there will be conflicts and in</font>

167
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:33,990
order to avoid forwarding loops we need

168
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:36,770
to have a or at least drop packets or

169
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:39,810
what have you we need to have a

170
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:43,380
consistent<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolution policy when</font>

171
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:45,479
conflicts are detected there have been

172
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">multiple options discussed in the draft</font>

173
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,600
over the past year the<font color="#E5E5E5"> latest version of</font>

174
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,400
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft specifies one of the options</font>

175
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,110
as the one that the working group has

176
00:11:53,400 --> 00:12:00,569
selected and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

177
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:04,860
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in more detail next since Berlin we</font>

178
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:08,700
got some input from principally one

179
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:11,790
service provider with some support from

180
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:14,640
a second we got an indication<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one</font>

181
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:16,620
vendor has implemented ignore overlap

182
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,860
only which was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy choices</font>

183
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:22,610
and we've received no other input I was

184
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:26,450
kind of hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would get more input</font>

185
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:29,990
but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have received</font>

186
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:33,470
we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have added</font>

187
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:36,230
and a support for an SMS<font color="#E5E5E5"> preference</font>

value<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk about that's more so</font>

189
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:42,830
based on the input that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have received</font>

190
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,930
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> selected the ignore overlap only</font>

191
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,670
as the policy of choice and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:52,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's specified in the latest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> version</font>

193
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:57,529
of the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> next so srms preference is</font>

194
00:12:52,190 --> 00:13:00,589
a new attribute that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is per node</font>

195
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:03,260
attribute that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we've defined</font>

196
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:06,320
advertisements in both the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp drafts</font>

197
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:11,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">issn ospf to advertise it it's simply an</font>

198
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:14,510
8-bit unsigned number<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 is reserved to</font>

199
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:16,790
say these advertisements SMS

200
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:20,600
advertisements are not to be used this

201
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:22,219
gives an operator a way to start

202
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:26,300
configuring something and advertise and

203
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:28,160
verify it before it actually gets used 1

204
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:32,089
through 2 55 is an actual preference

205
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:35,930
value higher being preferred by default

206
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:39,079
an SMS advertisement is has a value of

207
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:43,180
128 that means if you don't advertise

208
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:45,529
this if there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp advertisement</font>

209
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,969
since this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a new advertisement we</font>

210
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:49,700
obviously have implementations that

211
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:55,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't support it you will assign 128</font>

212
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:57,350
those advertisements for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SIDS that</font>

213
00:13:55,579 --> 00:14:00,020
are advertised in prefix reach ability

214
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:02,600
advertisements we have not<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed the</font>

215
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:05,240
format so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't added any fields to</font>

216
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,370
actually advertise a preference value

217
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:11,240
for them they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> all assigned a</font>

218
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:12,950
value of 192 so by default the prefix

219
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,290
reach ability advertisements are going

220
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:18,020
to be preferred over SMS advertisements

221
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:20,180
but given the values we've chosen if

222
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,740
somebody wants to prefer SMS

223
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:27,790
advertisements they still have room

224
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:31,450
above 192 to to make that choice<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

225
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:35,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay the the representation of a</font>

226
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:39,140
generalized mapping entry was modified

227
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:41,570
slightly the first field it used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

228
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,310
is this is the source from a prefix

229
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:45,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">reach ability advertisement or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ms or</font>

230
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:48,469
srms advertisement it's been now

231
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:50,900
replaced by the preference value other

232
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,720
than that this is the same that has been

233
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,160
in earlier versions of the draft so if

234
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,830
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> down at the bottom there's two</font>

235
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,410
examples by default if you have a

236
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,690
preference of 192 that would be from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

237
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:07,610
prefix reach ability advertisement 128

238
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:11,120
is from an SMS advertisement next a

239
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:15,190
quick review<font color="#CCCCCC"> of terminology there are</font>

240
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:18,890
prefixed conflicts<font color="#E5E5E5"> and syd conflicts the</font>

241
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:21,020
prefix conflicts refers to in both cases

242
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:23,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're referring to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> object that has a</font>

243
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,339
conflict so in a prefix conflict you

244
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:27,860
have two<font color="#E5E5E5"> different SIDS assigned to the</font>

245
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:29,630
same prefix in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> CID conflict you have</font>

246
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:35,300
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> CID assigned to two different</font>

247
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:37,700
prefixes next how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> achieve</font>

248
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,920
consistency clearly everybody has to

249
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the same database or it's just</font>

250
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,660
impossible to<font color="#E5E5E5"> guarantee that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you will</font>

251
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,250
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the same conclusion just because</font>

252
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,740
you've configured something locally

253
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,720
doesn't mean that you include it in your

254
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,430
conflict resolution it has to be

255
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,120
advertised so that everybody in the

256
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:59,060
network sees this value as well and the

257
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,550
preference for the advertisement is

258
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,380
based on the advertisement itself not

259
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:06,949
where it came from we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't take into</font>

260
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:09,970
account<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source ID at all and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whether</font>

261
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:12,920
the advertisement is local to the box or

262
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:20,000
advertised remotely also doesn't matter

263
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:21,709
next so we have two sources<font color="#E5E5E5"> one from the</font>

264
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,060
prefix reach ability advertisement one

265
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:28,850
from SRS advertisement and again in both

266
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases you you only use things if they're</font>

267
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,050
actually up for advertised not just

268
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:36,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">because they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were locally configured in</font>

269
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:39,439
the case of remote advertisements it's

270
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,970
what is reachable that you can use if

271
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,250
you can't reach it it's potentially a

272
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:45,250
stale advertisement next

273
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:49,639
so these were the three policies that

274
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:55,519
we've discussed over the past few

275
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:57,199
meetings the based on the limited input

276
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:04,220
that we've received we've selected

277
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:07,549
ignore overlap only next this is the

278
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,289
preference rule the preference rule has

279
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:12,709
not changed since<font color="#CCCCCC"> previous versions</font>

280
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:15,500
other than previously we had specified

281
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:17,600
prefer prefix reach ability / SMS

282
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,380
advertisements one point we were

283
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:24,109
experimenting with the other way<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

284
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:25,909
now we have the preference so we just

285
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:30,350
substituted the preference value was the

286
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:32,720
first tiebreaker next this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a working</font>

287
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">example I presented this the last time</font>

288
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,570
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to spend a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of time on</font>

289
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:39,950
it I left it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the slides so that folks</font>

290
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:43,490
who had not seen it before I could go

291
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:50,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">through it so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we could go next next</font>

292
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:52,880
next next and<font color="#CCCCCC"> one more okay this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font>

293
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:57,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">a summary of the example test results</font>

294
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">and based on that particular example you</font>

295
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:02,600
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ignore overlap only</font>

296
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:06,350
resulted in the greatest<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of</font>

297
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:09,649
prefixes that still had a CID associated

298
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:13,100
with them based upon the preference

299
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:15,439
policy we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know whether we've</font>

300
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:21,559
selected the correct one of course but

301
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:23,450
we have selected something next slide so

302
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:26,840
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what I really want to</font>

303
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,899
spend a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of time on here again</font>

304
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,370
based on the input we've received so far

305
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:35,449
ignore overlap only is what we've chosen

306
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:37,928
who we don't get further inputs that's

307
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:41,090
the way the draft is going to proceed I

308
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:45,770
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to emphasize some points about</font>

309
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:47,539
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> complexity that this introduces in</font>

310
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,700
your implementation and in achieving

311
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:52,520
interoperability interoperability means

312
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,890
you've got multiple implementations in

313
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,510
your network if they don't come up with

314
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:59,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same answer based on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

315
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:01,690
database because either because of a bug

316
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:04,270
or because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a misinterpretation of the</font>

317
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:06,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">specification then we're not going to</font>

318
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:09,879
achieve our goal of getting a consistent

319
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:12,670
resolution network-wide so here's a

320
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,190
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of examples when I say order</font>

321
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:17,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">matters so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there remember there's two</font>

322
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:21,940
types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of conflicts there are prefix</font>

323
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:26,560
conflicts where you have different SIDS

324
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:29,740
assigned to the same prefix and these

325
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:34,440
these conflicts are constrained to a

326
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:38,550
single topology and the single<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm</font>

327
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:41,140
there are Sid conflicts<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you have</font>

328
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:45,040
the the same Sid as assigned to

329
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:47,050
different prefixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what this is</font>

330
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">illustrating is it makes a difference</font>

331
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:52,270
whether when you apply your the

332
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,400
preference rule whether you do prefix

333
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:57,010
conflict resolution first followed by

334
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:01,240
Sid conflict resolution or vice versa

335
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:05,890
and basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what happens here in the</font>

336
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:09,520
first example we take the first entry

337
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:12,100
and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at prefix conflicts</font>

338
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,350
first so we have two entries for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 192</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 021</font>

339
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:18,639
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> compare them we pick the first one</font>

340
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:21,250
because it has a lower<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sid and then we</font>

341
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,110
compare so we've now gotten rid of the

342
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,990
second entry we now compare the first

343
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:28,600
entry to the third entry and there's no

344
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:31,150
conflict there and we end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with two</font>

345
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:34,260
entries in the active policy if however

346
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:37,450
we were to take the same database and

347
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:39,129
process the SID conflicts first then

348
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:43,300
we'd start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two entries that</font>

349
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:45,820
have Sid 200 and we'd pick the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

350
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:48,310
entry<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it has lower prefix and</font>

351
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:51,909
then we compare it to the third entry

352
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:53,409
and now we've got two entries with the

353
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:56,080
same prefix so we have to choose between

354
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:58,660
them we end up choosing the one with the

355
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,449
lower Sid so in the second case we end

356
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:05,260
up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one prefix</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's in</font>

357
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:08,020
our active policy so somebody could say

358
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,820
I have followed<font color="#E5E5E5"> the preference rules</font>

359
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,350
defined in the draft but if they don't

360
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">do things in the same order they're</font>

361
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:17,449
going to come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a different answer</font>

362
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:20,540
next slide here's another<font color="#CCCCCC"> example and</font>

363
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:23,810
this is peculiar to the ignore overlap

364
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:27,110
only policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember an ignore overlap</font>

365
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:30,520
only if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an SMS entry that say</font>

366
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:34,459
covers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has a range greater than 1</font>

367
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:36,740
i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to operationally and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font>

368
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,800
talking here<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how the code might be</font>

369
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:43,820
implemented but i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to only</font>

370
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:46,159
exclude the individual entries within

371
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:49,010
that range of 1,000 that actually have a

372
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,750
conflict and end up on the losing end so

373
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,670
we have the concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the under I've</font>

374
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,730
dentry the original mapping entry that

375
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:57,290
was advertised by a node and then we

376
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:00,530
have the derived entries which is

377
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:02,629
essentially those portions of the range

378
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:05,930
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was originally advertised that turn</font>

379
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:10,100
out not to be in conflict and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

380
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:12,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">an example where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> depending upon whether</font>

381
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,810
you make your comparison against the

382
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,760
under I've den trees or the derived

383
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:20,570
entries you end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a different</font>

384
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,830
answer in the interest of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

385
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:24,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the steps here</font>

386
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:28,429
I'm happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer any questions on it</font>

387
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:30,590
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list part or offline but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the what</font>

388
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can see here is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you end up with</font>

389
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:34,879
different results depending upon how you

390
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:37,700
do it and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point I'm trying to</font>

391
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,450
emphasize here is ignore overlap only

392
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:43,700
introduces implementation complexity and

393
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:46,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">two vendors can say I have implemented</font>

394
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,870
the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have good reason to</font>

395
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,570
believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they they followed things</font>

396
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:54,439
but they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> things slightly differently</font>

397
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:56,750
and they end up with different answers

398
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,030
and so we have not achieved the goal

399
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,850
which is to get consistent conflict

400
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:03,200
resolution policy throughout the network

401
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:05,330
and I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to emphasize this point</font>

402
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,760
and it's it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> been appointed</font>

403
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:11,990
discussion I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think for the past year in</font>

404
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:14,890
the context of this draft is that there

405
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:18,020
are there sort of competing goals here

406
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:19,790
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them has been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Express goal</font>

407
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:22,220
let's let's try and maximize traffic

408
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:23,720
delivery what's in our conflict

409
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,450
resolution let's try to make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

410
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,840
we have a CID<font color="#E5E5E5"> for as many prefixes as we</font>

411
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,510
pass

412
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,939
weekend and the other goal is to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

413
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:34,310
keep the conflict resolution policy

414
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,780
simple so that it's easy for everybody's

415
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:41,629
implementation to come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

416
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:44,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">answer if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we put too much</font>

417
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:47,390
complexity in here and we also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

418
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:49,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember that whatever answer you come</font>

419
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:54,080
up with you're not guaranteed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

420
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:55,400
the intended answer based on what the

421
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,010
intention was when you deployed your

422
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,840
network we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> making an arbitrary</font>

423
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:02,240
choice based on an arbitrary preference

424
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,100
rule so we may not actually choose the

425
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,060
prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> that maximizes your traffic</font>

426
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:11,439
delivery do we want to invest a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

427
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:13,850
time in implementation complexity and

428
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,080
comparing implementations to see if they

429
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:17,449
actually come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer</font>

430
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,699
under the same conditions this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me is</font>

431
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:22,400
a significant risk with ignore overlap

432
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:25,460
only and I'm not standing up here and

433
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,770
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say absolutely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't do it</font>

434
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:31,280
the feedback we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have gotten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thus far has</font>

435
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:33,250
been we prefer ignore overlap only but

436
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,300
we need to make a conscious decision

437
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:37,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buying into a lot of</font>

438
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:41,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">complexity we're potentially going to</font>

439
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:44,270
spend time in investigating

440
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:47,000
interoperability issues and the end

441
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:48,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">result is not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to guarantee</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

442
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,330
we're actually going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> delivering</font>

443
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:56,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">the traffic that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we really want to</font>

444
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:59,120

445
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:02,420
summary<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a result of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the examples</font>

446
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">that your implementation has to do</font>

447
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">things in a certain order you have to do</font>

prefix conflicts before Sid conflicts

449
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:13,399
and you have to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the entries</font>

450
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,500
based on the the order in which the

451
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:20,620
attributes are specified in the

452
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,620
preference rule next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh</font>

453
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,440
okay these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some i guess the sort of</font>

454
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,980
the output of what might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be next for the</font>

455
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">draft if we're if the working group is</font>

456
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,270
essentially happy with the choice that

457
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,610
has been made<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think what we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

458
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:41,850
is add some text in the draft that

459
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:44,399
clarifies these ordering issues related

460
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:46,889
to the ignore overlap only policy so

461
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,740
it's at least clearer for people who

462
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:56,360
implement this that this is critical to

463
00:25:49,740 --> 00:26:00,929
the validity of their implementation and

464
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:02,428
and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to clearly state that there</font>

465
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:04,980
is some text in the draft now but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

466
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:06,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it needs to be embellished to</font>

467
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,460
indicate that just following the

468
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,070
preference rule doesn't guarantee

469
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:16,320
interoperability you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to follow</font>

470
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:19,409
the order and I put a little side

471
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,970
comment here which is the complexity is

472
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:24,510
associated with the ignore overlap

473
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:28,110
policy ignore overlap only if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were to</font>

474
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:31,110
choose it'd be the simplest policy which

475
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:33,059
is you've got things that conflict you

476
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:35,129
don't know which one is correct ignore

477
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:41,700
them both we would not have this

478
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:44,340
complexity next or is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the last</font>

479
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:48,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">one now so look I think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

480
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:51,780
I just want I would really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

481
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:53,700
more feedback if we can that this is the

482
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,379
direction that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working group wants</font>

483
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,470
to go if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are people out there who</font>

484
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">have been silent up to now this is</font>

485
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:03,059
really the opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak up</font>

486
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:05,340
because if you don't I think that you

487
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:07,440
know we're done the draft will will get

488
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:11,040
polished up and and will progress some

489
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,950
become an RFC so if the feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> is yes</font>

490
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,020
let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> with what we have that's what</font>

491
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:19,049
we're going to do if we do get other

492
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:22,100
feedback then we could potentially

493
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:27,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">revise this and go to a simpler policy</font>

494
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:30,840
questions comments I hand this is a much

495
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:33,240
enduring so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say a last revision I</font>

496
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,530
didn't read it actually so but I have

497
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">been following</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I have a lot of</font>

498
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,160
comments in the mailing list

499
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,040
earlier versions so after<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking into</font>

500
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:44,070
more this like you know keep it simple

501
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">is extremely important but you know you</font>

502
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:49,409
already progress so far that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

503
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:51,060
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it complex but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sokale</font>

504
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:53,310
at the point what I might say is one

505
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:55,649
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> first for question is you said</font>

506
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:57,840
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> even you follow the preferences and</font>

507
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:00,480
order you see still see interoperable

508
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,120
tissues that's what you said no no I'm

509
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,980
saying if an implementation could use

510
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,020
the same preference rule but process

511
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:10,260
entries in a different order and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

512
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:12,240
different answer in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my examples that are</font>

513
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,190
in the slides illustrate that but you

514
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,560
are mentioning that you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking to</font>

515
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:19,230
follow the particular order now right

516
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:23,100
correct but you cannot guarantee that

517
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:24,720
how you receive the<font color="#CCCCCC"> LSPs right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to so if</font>

518
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,149
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about transient issues</font>

519
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,400
that occur when you're converting this

520
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:32,190
is another type of convergence sure at a

521
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,440
given instant in time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is you</font>

522
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:36,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may have inconsistencies but this is</font>

523
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,580
no different than what happens when you

524
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:42,810
converge with prefixed reach ability for

525
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:44,370
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after looking</font>

526
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:45,780
into modern this like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will</font>

527
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:47,250
give more comments in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list but you</font>

528
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,530
know keep it simple is better actually

529
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:51,840
should it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only implementation it's</font>

530
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,899
about debugging to once it's deployed so

531
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,470
I agree are you they are you then

532
00:28:53,900 --> 00:29:00,600
advocating for the ignore policy sorry

533
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,880
to put you on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spot but also ignore</font>

534
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,350
is better actually so just drop<font color="#CCCCCC"> it if it</font>

535
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">is conflict resolution operator will to</font>

536
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:08,129
have to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> care it or what is they</font>

537
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:10,710
have to come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that what</font>

538
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:13,440
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the misconfigured actually okay thank</font>

539
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:16,950
you shut da juniper networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

540
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,840
comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the preference rules I in</font>

541
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:21,360
network consolidation cases like if

542
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:24,649
multiple protocols are running then we

543
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:27,120
should have a protocol preference also

544
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:28,590
in the preference set of preference

545
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,379
rules and I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be on the</font>

546
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:34,459
top<font color="#E5E5E5"> because generally we apply the</font>

547
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:37,080
protocol preference I mean if there is I

548
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,520
mean when network operators look at the

549
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,949
network they think of protocol

550
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,320
preference as paying as getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

551
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:46,040
highest preference so so this is

552
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,399
actually explicitly stated in the draft

553
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:51,800
the affording plane is protocol

554
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:55,610
stick it does not care whether the route

555
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:58,129
was put in by ospf or ice is so the

556
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:59,600
source whether it's a protocol

557
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:02,300
difference whether it's a router ID

558
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,659
difference isn't deliberately<font color="#E5E5E5"> not taken</font>

559
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:07,070
into account in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the preference rule but</font>

560
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,780
if you if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

561
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:10,510
consolidation cases right the way it

562
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:13,129
works today if there is conflict

563
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:15,770
conflicting entries between ospf and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

564
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:19,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">sighs then it is the protocol preference</font>

565
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:21,440
that cut that that plays the<font color="#CCCCCC"> role right</font>

566
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:25,700
I mean that<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> apply to segment</font>

567
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,530
routing as well so if you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> now you</font>

568
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,810
have to go back quite a number of slides

569
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:33,070
but there's there's a point<font color="#E5E5E5"> being made</font>

570
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:37,220
that you what you use in your database

571
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:39,679
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that you then look at conflicts</font>

572
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:44,570
is based upon what you actually use in

573
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:49,160
the foreign a plane so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if</font>

574
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:52,730
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two different routes from from</font>

575
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:54,500

585

586
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:27,709
if you have a cogs like something's

00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:30,640
broken and whatever allows operations to

find it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix it the fastest is</font>

589
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:38,480
goodness and um it seems like it's more

00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,629
scratching their head for some time

594
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,360
before they figure out what combination

595
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:57,100
of things caused it

596
00:31:49,360 --> 00:32:00,490
I lobbying for hobby I have a I have

597
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:03,939
some comments on this dropped<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the</font>

598
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:07,540
first one I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I agree they see the</font>

599
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:10,480
problem but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact that the</font>

know the major vendors the not know I am

here today asking a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of vendors the</font>

604
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:28,390
only directly use the label instead of

usual in an order taker so much so much

616
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:09,190
my comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let me see I respond</font>

617
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:13,240
to both the the problem that arises here

618
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:17,110
has nothing to do we are in fact using a

619
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:20,799
you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> srgb but if you have a</font>

620
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:25,270
configuration on one node that assigns

621
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:28,000
index<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1004 one dot 100 101 and on</font>

622
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:29,799
another note it assigns index 2004

623
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,929
wonder wonder wonder one you have a

624
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:39,340
conflict that's the problem we're trying

625
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:44,290
to solve I jasa from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Huawei I have some</font>

626
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:46,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions about this draft because o in</font>

627
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:51,580
this draft we have listed some scenarios

628
00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:55,270
for the comfort of conflict but I single

629
00:33:51,580 --> 00:34:00,850
person there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of there is some</font>

630
00:33:55,270 --> 00:34:02,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">other scenarios of confidence like if we</font>

631
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:08,560
have if the

632
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:14,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">hmm same prefix have a different ID how</font>

633
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:16,750
to solve this so both again both prefix

634
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:18,790
conflicts because the like that are

635
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:23,168
answered conflicts are covered in the

636
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:25,629
ground Acosta is any<font color="#CCCCCC"> cast a segment they</font>

637
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:28,359
have the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> preface but if the</font>

638
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:32,379
different Reuters configure the

639
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:35,320
different anxieties oh that is still

640
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:37,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of what we cover the conflict yeah</font>

641
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:44,110
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's part of what is covered in</font>

642
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:48,340
the draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and and another scenarios</font>

643
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:53,260
about is ah because we do because we

644
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:57,340
define the the in the in the in the

645
00:34:53,260 --> 00:35:00,130
domain we have those SIDS global but it

646
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:05,440
is different domain like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different</font>

647
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:09,040
area or different process how how how to

648
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:14,500
consider this scenario because sometimes

649
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:19,170
we have to import the prefix from a lot

650
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:24,609
one area<font color="#CCCCCC"> to another area right this is</font>

651
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:29,380
another scenario and and non scenario is

652
00:35:24,609 --> 00:35:33,549
the different IP protocol if you have if

653
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:36,910
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is easy I I size the</font>

654
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:44,260
protocol and ospf protocol if they

655
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:47,020
define the same o SI d44 prefix or four

656
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:50,290
different prefix how to resolve this

657
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:55,180
problem or resolve this conflict so

658
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:59,170
maybe we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can give some clarification for</font>

659
00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:01,089
such scenarios so that they transfer

660
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:04,420
your last point the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario is covered</font>

661
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:06,910
it's already covered in the draft as far

662
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:09,369
as your previous point what we're

663
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:13,930
dealing with here is the fawning plane

664
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:15,970
for a particular domain because if we

665
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:16,560
get to the edge of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the domain then we're</font>

666
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:18,959
going to

667
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,940
to potentially use a completely

668
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,130
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sid and different label to go</font>

669
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the other domain that's a different</font>

670
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:30,630
database we're not trying to resolve

671
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:33,870
conflicts between domains<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay digging</font>

672
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:35,580
and it's tough it's tough steps a whim

673
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:38,670
and I'm taking questions if they are

674
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:41,970
quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're quick I just a</font>

675
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:44,550
comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I think maybe I tell you</font>

676

also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pc union</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> state shutdown</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

679
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:56,730
proposed the policy usual<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

680
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:59,310
overlap between the SS and ospf and also

681
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:01,650
we maybe have this the overlap issue

682
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:04,290
between the ospf OSS<font color="#E5E5E5"> between in the</font>

683
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:07,770
state p ceiling state you will get<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

684
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:09,990
and more time to solve this usual<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

685
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:13,470
so introduce more and more complex

686
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:17,220
policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay more and more complex</font>

687
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:24,500
product protocol extension that's not we

688
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:28,200
want ok that's a my comment women before

689
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:30,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah be quick still I know you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font>

00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">on your speaking time romantic smoky eye</font>

691
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:34,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think what is important here i think</font>

692
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:37,410
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to we have to decide between as</font>

less stated before between<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimizing</font>

the impact when you have conflict first

the complexity of implementation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

696
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,240
think well I would advocate is<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

697
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,860
operators<font color="#E5E5E5"> who want to deploy this</font>

698
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,049
technology what they really would like

699
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:50,610
to get and achieve in this situation of

700
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,800
course you would like to avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

701
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:55,770
conflict by all means but there is

702
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,530
manual things which will result into

703
00:37:55,770 --> 00:38:00,000
this situation and I think what is

704
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:02,280
important element would like to stress

705
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,680
this to get operators input to this

706
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,960
question because I think fenders we all

707
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,669
prefer to do keep it simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> although we</font>

708
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,710
implement it to more complex schema at

709
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:13,440
the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's important</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

710
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:15,180
understand what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the operators input</font>

711
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,900
on this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will probably</font>

712
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:20,730
determine where we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right yeah</font>

713
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:23,280
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want to emphasize what</font>

714
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:25,230
wind said so i am happy to see that

715
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,940
finally people realize that simplicity

716
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:32,060
is a good thing unfortunately so far

717
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:34,400
but has been very silent<font color="#CCCCCC"> doom I cannot</font>

718
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:36,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the mailing list so it's good to</font>

719
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,099
converge towards a request for

720
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:42,560
simplicity it would even better if more

721
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:46,670
operators can speak up and tell us<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

722
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:51,290
they want and so we can close this in

723
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:55,010
the best way but so far we didn't have

724
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:57,470
much voices speaking up on that on that

725
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:59,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">sign so it's it's nice to come now and</font>

726
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:01,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">say oh this is too complex let's</font>

727
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:05,149
simplify it yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's good to know</font>

728
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:09,589
it now but please now speak it once for

729
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:13,369
all and let's close the issue Robin are

730
00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:16,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">you an operator was intense no same</font>

731
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:18,140
question too yes I jungle joe from

732
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,790
google<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not really interested in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

733
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,828
solution to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this problem to be honest</font>

734
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:23,480
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rather take the simple</font>

735
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:25,579
approach we<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage a number of number of</font>

736
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,319
spaces across various routers in our

737
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:29,720
domain and I think we'll take the risk

738
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:31,490
that there is a an issue if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do miss</font>

739
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:36,259
configure a router that we can then

740
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:38,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">correct very quickly stefan from orange</font>

741
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:42,020
so issue is that a loss can happen and

742
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:43,849
we cannot really prevent it so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

743
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:50,740
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to maximize the traffic</font>

744
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:50,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we save no Jeff very short comment</font>

745
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,810
you have five seconds five seconds there

746
00:39:55,250 --> 00:40:00,339
are huge deployments of<font color="#CCCCCC"> segment charges</font>

747
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:04,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">of today go talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to them personally</font>

748
00:40:00,339 --> 00:40:13,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks thank you guys and thank you for</font>

749
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:13,930
your discussion points Stefan Europe

750
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:27,939
no till you tell me when to switch light

751
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:30,340
ok so this presentation is about an

752
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:34,030
update for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> watching young</font>

753
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:36,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">mother draft for next slide please so</font>

754
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:39,970
it's been a very long time since we

755
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:42,580
presented via latest update so just a

756
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:44,319
good but it's a very straightforward so

757
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:48,130
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a configuration and operation</font>

758
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:50,790
model for segment<font color="#E5E5E5"> wedding so just the</font>

759
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:54,460
base of<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment routing or the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font>

760
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:58,060
extensions so activating signal routing

761
00:40:54,460 --> 00:41:00,910
for ISAs an ospf it's in a separate

762
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:06,360
document that are in a dedicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> walking</font>

763
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:10,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">home next slide so were about the change</font>

764
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:14,440
so it was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very old discussion about</font>

765
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:16,600
having per<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol srgb so there was an</font>

766
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:19,780
agreement to a support be so we added a

767
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:22,390
feature for this report so it's purely

768
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:26,080
optional someone does not want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spot</font>

769
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:28,120
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> set to real to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implementation but at</font>

770
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:34,120
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> the model is exposing this</font>

771
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:38,020
capability next slide we had it also

772
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:41,500
couple of notifications but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we</font>

773
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:43,360
are not done on this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially we</font>

774
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:46,540
need to align with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conflict</font>

775
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:50,170
resolution draft about the first one

776
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:51,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we added which is a srgb collision</font>

777
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:55,680
we are wondering if it's really

778
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:59,290
necessary on that to have it v<font color="#E5E5E5"> e</font>

779
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:02,440
normally it cannot happen because the

780
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:05,080
sender is not allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to propagate</font>

781
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:07,060
multiple overlapping srgb but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

782
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:09,640
same time we conflict resolution drafted

783
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:12,250
if i remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> correctly say is that the</font>

784
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:14,680
receiver must check that it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

785
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:16,660
happen so if this check is really

786
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:19,089
necessary i think it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

787
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:22,620
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a notification but</font>

788
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:22,620
we can discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this</font>

789
00:42:24,349 --> 00:42:29,479
we added also support for a different

790
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:33,618
algorithm for the prefix seed so

791
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:36,109
especially we added via<font color="#CCCCCC"> Street SPF that</font>

792
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:37,970
is still under discussion but at least

793
00:42:36,109 --> 00:42:44,328
it is where<font color="#E5E5E5"> former configuration point</font>

794
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:46,578
of view we also added<font color="#E5E5E5"> the support of MSD</font>

795
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:49,069
so we have also<font color="#E5E5E5"> a feature for this so</font>

796
00:42:46,579 --> 00:42:52,099
it's optional and we have both

797
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:54,950
configuration of the MSD and also

798
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:58,039
operational state so although i add some

799
00:42:54,950 --> 00:43:02,808
discussion this week<font color="#CCCCCC"> weaver with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jeff</font>

800
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:05,150
who raised visa MSD stuff so today

801
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:07,009
things that were some may be other

802
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:10,670
issues that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not able to expose</font>

803
00:43:07,009 --> 00:43:13,009
directly via MSD 22 we control planes

804
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:15,019
which it may be interesting to have a

805
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:17,359
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> configuration if we cannot</font>

806
00:43:15,019 --> 00:43:25,220
directly retrieve the information of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

807
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:28,279
other so a big change that has been done

808
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:30,769
really recently is a split of this

809
00:43:28,279 --> 00:43:34,749
segment<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing yang model into two</font>

810
00:43:30,769 --> 00:43:39,109
parts so we are we created a common

811
00:43:34,749 --> 00:43:42,769
segment routing model which mainly

812
00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:46,489
include some grouping so why it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

813
00:43:42,769 --> 00:43:50,180
done we were requested by some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

814
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:55,039
from aight where her<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these that are</font>

815
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:58,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">working and topology modeling to be able</font>

816
00:43:55,039 --> 00:44:00,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">to reuse some of our groupings and at</font>

817
00:43:58,729 --> 00:44:03,379
the same time they<font color="#E5E5E5"> did not want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

818
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:05,390
import the old segment routing model

819
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:07,700
because it's not rest aside it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

820
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:10,640
necessary for when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> only want some</font>

821
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:14,328
really piece of I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say encoding on</font>

822
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,890
some stuff so we separated the groupings

823
00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:18,609
in two parts we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some common</font>

824
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:21,859
groupings that are we used by the

825
00:44:18,609 --> 00:44:25,640
topology model aight where I sauna and

826
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:28,660
season and we have a real segment

827
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:32,440
routing groupings that are used by the

828
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">AGP models</font>

829
00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:40,489
in terms of next steps so regarding via

830
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:43,599
operational<font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion normally</font>

831
00:44:40,489 --> 00:44:46,789
we are aligned with the current policies

832
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:50,179
and consensus within ATF so we have two

833
00:44:46,789 --> 00:44:53,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">different trees we have still some work</font>

834
00:44:50,179 --> 00:44:58,339
to align with all the latest draft

835
00:44:53,949 --> 00:45:01,279
especially including via SLB via SMS

836
00:44:58,339 --> 00:45:03,229
preference is not very yet maybe adding

837
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:06,799
also a new notification from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the prefix</font>

838
00:45:03,229 --> 00:45:11,239
conflict so we have some alignment to

839
00:45:06,799 --> 00:45:13,459
our to do but it's it's in good

840
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:16,400
condition to maybe close it soon that I

841
00:45:13,459 --> 00:45:23,269
I don't know if we you will need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait</font>

842
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:26,179
to maybe close via so config draft and

843
00:45:23,269 --> 00:45:30,499
son before going to last call this

844
00:45:26,179 --> 00:45:34,669
document so we are welcoming comments

845
00:45:30,499 --> 00:45:39,408
reviews critics or whatever so feel free

846
00:45:34,669 --> 00:45:42,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">to raise your point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go in from</font>

Holly because Deveny you are from the

848

Stefan that's Stephanie Stephanie the

woman named us definite 70 Stephanie<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

850
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:57,349
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that either you're from this</font>

851
00:45:55,159 --> 00:46:00,979
operator I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll have this</font>

852
00:45:57,349 --> 00:46:04,369
the experience enough you view the

853
00:46:00,979 --> 00:46:08,239
maintenance and the management of the

854
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:11,239
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this one now I</font>

855
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:16,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most important challenger for</font>

856
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:19,130
the operator either to a a most

857
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:21,609
importantly is a faster service provini

858
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:24,919
to get more<font color="#E5E5E5"> revenue is that the right</font>

859
00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:27,799
yes it's right now okay wait for it ok

860
00:46:24,919 --> 00:46:31,069
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think do you agree the previous</font>

861
00:46:27,799 --> 00:46:36,969
slides about the overlap policy you

862
00:46:31,069 --> 00:46:40,369
think is a useful work on not useful I

863
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:43,549

873

be conflict is that normally it should

874
00:47:10,859 --> 00:47:15,960
not happen because the sender machine is

875
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:18,029

00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:27,779
that the receiver must do a check out

what is the consensus now on<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment</font>

892
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:05,910
routing we cannot really put all the IDS

893
00:48:03,869 --> 00:48:08,250
and so on so we need to put the base

894
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:10,740
which is stable now and then close it

895
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:14,490
and you may be able to augment it in

905

completing you so this draft is about

906
00:48:54,300 --> 00:49:02,100
how can we create an unprotected path

using<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment routing next slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> please</font>

908
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:06,990
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really strong requirement</font>

909
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:10,319
from our customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not a new</font>

910
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:12,479
requirement even<font color="#CCCCCC"> with RSVP today we are</font>

911
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:15,000
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create paths that are not</font>

912
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:17,700
subject to fairy world because for

913
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,680
example the customer wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have two</font>

914
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:22,200
separated path to diverse path and wants

915
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">to manage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the protection by itself maybe</font>

916
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:28,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not trust our or</font>

917
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:31,140
whatever but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's choice so we have</font>

918
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:33,600
two full fit and today the issue we have

919
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:38,129
the segment routing is that there's

920
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:41,460
multiple solutions to do with and we as

921
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:45,630
an operator we want to have a singer

922
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:47,790
recommended way to provide this kind of

923
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:51,630
service because let's say that you have

924
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:53,610
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> five options to fulfill</font>

925
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:56,130
these requirements if you have five

926
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:58,050
vendors and each vendor is taking in

927
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:59,670
twins its implementation a different

928
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:01,950
approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

929
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:03,900
multi-vendor network we will not be able

930
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> build an end-to-end service because</font>

931
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:09,300
all these options<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be optional in</font>

932
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:10,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of implementation I and I never</font>

933
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,930
seen a vendor in commenting already

934
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:14,939
possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> option so we need to have a</font>

935
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:17,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of recommended solution that</font>

936
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:20,940
everyone's everyone need to support and

937
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:23,820
then it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be up to implementation to</font>

938
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:30,870
add other options as well but at least

939
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:32,550
this one may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be monitoring so first one</font>

940
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:35,400
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal of the draft so we need to</font>

941
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:37,380
present the various options so for the

942
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,720
moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really opened we don't have</font>

943
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:42,570
any recommended solution and please

944
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:45,060
don't blame me about the content of a

945
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:47,040
draft I wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to be honest i rotted</font>

946
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:48,029
couple of minutes before going to

947
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,330
vacation so

948
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:54,210
journalist is not really complete it's

949
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:56,029
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> far from this but I wanted</font>

950
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:59,700
absolutely to start this discussion

951
00:50:56,030 --> 00:51:03,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">within this idea that's why I wrote with</font>

952
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:05,460
draft we need to remember that with

953
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:08,670
spring we have some constraints today

954
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:11,490
maybe these constraints will disappear

955
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:14,430
in couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> years but we still have</font>

956
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:16,950
issue with<font color="#CCCCCC"> MSD so capabilities of a</font>

957
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:19,440
particular not to push a number of

958
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:22,589
flavors and we have also some load

959
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:25,940
balancing issue is router capable to

960
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:31,980
inspect for example the IP payload or

961
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:34,110
ashing of stack with 10 20 25 labels is

962
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:36,270
it really realistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not so these</font>

963
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:38,430
constraints we need to take them into<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

964
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:42,230
into account when we will decide we

965
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:46,560
recommended solution so we are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

966
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:48,090
highlight vid pros and cons I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

967
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:51,779
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good today but we need to</font>

968
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:55,350
progress on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just first</font>

969
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:59,160
overview and the goal is really to

970
00:51:55,350 --> 00:52:05,850
provide as an outcome a recommended

971
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:09,060
solution next slide so we have multiple

972
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:11,430
options today the first one the<font color="#E5E5E5"> easiest</font>

973
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:14,549
one you would say we can use only

974
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:17,609
adjacency seed because the adjacent cc'd

975
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:20,550
as a semantics that there that hellos<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

976
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:22,890
have an unprotected adjacent cc'd so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

977
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:24,330
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Saudi flag when we are able to</font>

978
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:29,190
have multiple edges on<font color="#E5E5E5"> CC don't</font>

979
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:31,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">particularly so we can do it but I think</font>

980
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:34,110
everybody can see that there are some

981
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:39,000
challenges because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have 20 up to</font>

982
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:41,160
cross I will need maybe 19 19 labels

983
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,620
just for the transport and then I will

984
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:45,930
need to add entropy and also service

985
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:49,950
libel suits does not seems to be

986
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:52,020
realistic honestly so we can try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

987
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:54,210
compress the stack by using a

988
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:56,550
combination of nodal<font color="#CCCCCC"> segments and</font>

989
00:52:54,210 --> 00:53:00,840
adjacent segments but here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have also</font>

990
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:01,770
multiple sub-options first one we need

991
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:05,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not see that</font>

992
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:09,330
is not protected so why not relying on

993
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:11,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">this new street SPF not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen so there</font>

994
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:14,730
was some<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion on this and with</font>

995
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:17,700
definition of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> strict SPF not seen so</font>

996
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:21,360
if i'm using the strict SPF<font color="#E5E5E5"> not see does</font>

997
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:23,640
it prevent it to be fast rewarded so

998
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:26,340
it's an open question and I think we

999
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:28,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">need a clarification on this because</font>

1000
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:32,640
normally strict SPF it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> following</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the SPF and it cannot go away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alviso</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1002
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:38,850
it fast throughout included in this or

1003
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:41,970
not such a question we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can think about</font>

1004
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:45,330
adding a flag in the prefix it so in

1005
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:47,730
turn not cede to say it<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be</font>

1006
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:50,580
protect it should be protected or or not

1007
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:53,100
like we have in the adjacency<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeds as</font>

1008
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:57,060
an option I'm not telling that it's good

1009
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:59,430
or not but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> an option and another</font>

1010
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:03,000
option we've not said is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

1011
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:08,370
create as an operator to not sit and we

1012
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:11,250
managed by local policies the activation

1013
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:15,390
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast free world for a particular node</font>

1014
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:18,300
seed or not but we will need different

1015
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:20,609
prefixes so it may increase our<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP</font>

1016
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:24,900
table and so on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I some impactor as</font>

1017
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:28,350
well we there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a last option Martin I</font>

1018
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:30,750
no worry so last option is to use a

1019
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:32,970
combination of adjacent CC than binding

1020
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:35,280
seed and we may be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> binding</font>

1021
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:38,129
seed to represent a list of adjacent

1022
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">cc'd so let's say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

1023
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:44,970
controller<font color="#E5E5E5"> some very smart controller</font>

1024
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:48,779
you may be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> place some transit</font>

1025
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:51,870
tunnels within the network associating a

1026
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:54,030
binding seed with this and then I will

1027
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:55,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able for my aunt went LSP to reuse</font>

1028
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:59,160
this painting<font color="#E5E5E5"> sheet sets an option as</font>

1029
00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:03,210
well can I take the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the</font>

1030
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:05,339
presentation I almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> finished so the</font>

1031
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:08,100
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> step so clearly we need to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead</font>

1032
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:10,650
with the analysis don't really take care

1033
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:14,190
about what is written<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the in the</font>

1034
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:15,130
draft so we need to progress<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this we</font>

1035
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,960
need we

1036
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:19,750
really need feedback from the working

1037
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,790
group on the pros and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cons and also is</font>

1038
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:27,730
there some other options<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we missed</font>

1039
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:30,490
maybe the really important<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is that</font>

1040
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:33,790
as an operator we have some deployment

1041
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:36,970
requirement so we need to have running

1042
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:39,640
code as soon as possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we need to</font>

1043
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:43,930
come with this recommended solution in a

1044
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:46,359
really fast manner so we would like to

1045
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:48,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">request working hope adoption for this</font>

1046
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,920
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> vanish it's not complete but we</font>

1047
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:52,960
really think that this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the work that</font>

1048
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:55,870
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and we need to come to a</font>

1049
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,820
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever it is so let's</font>

1050
00:55:55,870 --> 00:56:05,080
progress on this as soon as possible

1051
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:08,430
thank you just answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> so two questions</font>

1052
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:12,190
one here you are talking about

1053
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:14,740
destination based forwarding and segment

1054
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:16,360
routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> topologies typically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> underlay so</font>

1055
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:19,450
at some point here what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mean by</font>

1056
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:20,860
destination base for welding do so from

1057
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:22,810
a service point of view or for

1058
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:24,970
transporting transfer point of view each

1059
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:26,980
other you'll have VPN or any other

1060
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:29,500
service on<font color="#E5E5E5"> cup which will use the same</font>

1061
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:31,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">label and same IP address in the</font>

1062
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:33,670
transport<font color="#E5E5E5"> network at some point he'll</font>

1063
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:35,680
have to customers one asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1064
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:37,570
protected path while another one asking

1065
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,399
for not protect pass that's true that's

1066
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:41,950
true this is a requirement if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1067
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:44,650
establish a transport back from p1 to p2

1068
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:47,680
one customer may want a protected path

1069
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:50,290
one may want an unprotected path and one

1070
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:54,100
may want a constraint non-protected path

1071
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:57,130
or non<font color="#E5E5E5"> constraint protective f so our</font>

1072
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:59,290
load in semantics of see it might not

1073
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:02,110
just work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a unit more than that it</font>

1074
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:03,820
reads<font color="#E5E5E5"> every three sets yeah 3 3 sets</font>

1075
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:10,840
each different up a tree it's not no

1076
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:13,180
problem number two it's not really

1077
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:16,450
different than optical restoration with

1078
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:18,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">mpls faster out on top and bgp piquant</font>

1079
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:23,109
up right now maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just need to</font>

1080
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:27,190
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if your customer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wants to</font>

1081
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:28,780
use their own ingress protection so be

1082
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:32,109
they just need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that it</font>

1083
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:36,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">kicks in before you try to reactivate</font>

1084
00:57:32,109 --> 00:57:38,470
your transport or whatever it is yes but

1085
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:41,589
we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really know what are the times</font>

1086
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:43,839
that are used by all customer so sup my

1087
00:57:41,589 --> 00:57:45,339
point the problem spaces slider and we

1088
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:47,500
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> serious to consider it's a valid</font>

1089
00:57:45,339 --> 00:57:54,190
problem and what's working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely</font>

1090
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:57,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right with crisp errors so um</font>

1091
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:58,780
can you go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide with on the</font>

1092
00:57:57,099 --> 00:58:03,640
potential solutions you're looking at

1093
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:07,569
with ya even one back<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think no no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1094
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:09,400
forward forward sorry so you mentioned

1095
00:58:07,569 --> 00:58:11,650
not knowing the timers that the

1096
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:16,720
customers require I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> like with the</font>

1097
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:18,849
node Sid solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> um it seems to me like</font>

1098
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:21,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually it's going to converge with</font>

1099
00:58:18,849 --> 00:58:23,800
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp again that's true now you know</font>

1100
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:26,920
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could this occur in a second so is</font>

1101
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:28,750
that is that a problem I mean what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1102
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:31,540
the requirements on not<font color="#E5E5E5"> protection is it</font>

1103
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:33,640
not protection forever or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> protection</font>

1104
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:37,119
for five seconds or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 seconds what's</font>

1105
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:39,220
the goal here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of requirements</font>

1106
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:41,230
it's a question fairy world is not

1107
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:44,020
acceptable but I think regular

1108
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:47,920
conversions maybe because there will be

1109
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:52,270
a kind of fast free world like mechanism

1110
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:53,770
at just an outside so if the HP<font color="#CCCCCC"> concerns</font>

1111
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:56,619
i think it's fine because we need

1112
00:58:53,770 --> 00:59:00,220
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reestablish the path so</font>

1113
00:58:56,619 --> 00:59:07,119
the automatic reconversion so the path

1114
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:08,649
is needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok thanks ACM I think I I</font>

1115
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:10,780
haven't read<font color="#E5E5E5"> the drafters thought much</font>

1116
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:12,430
about it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i won't i may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have already</font>

1117
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:14,109
disclosed that I have an idea which of

1118
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:17,470
the solutions i prefer but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's</font>

1119
00:59:14,109 --> 00:59:20,410
good you can tell it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think number two</font>

1120
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:24,970
is is the best right now ah which flavor

1121
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:27,730
of nimble too ah adding the protection

1122
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:29,230
flag to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CID and having multiple states</font>

1123
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:32,380
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i but i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it more i</font>

1124
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:33,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">can see less</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shaking his head so because</font>

1125
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:37,670
I was already some description

1126
00:59:33,849 --> 00:59:40,549
underneath the bells<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ok but I</font>

1127
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:43,549
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's work we should adopt thank</font>

1128
00:59:40,549 --> 00:59:45,950
you so if you see my tickle stick SPF

1129
00:59:43,549 --> 00:59:47,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">meaning there's going to be a GP</font>

1130
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:49,899
convergence and potentially you'll get

1131
00:59:47,809 --> 00:59:55,040
unto the shortest paths again right

1132
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:57,290
right now in jail if a you could pre

1133
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,910
calculate button worst apology and have

1134
00:59:57,290 --> 01:00:00,589
your back up following your post

1135
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:04,190
conversion so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's no really different</font>

1136
01:00:00,589 --> 01:00:06,650
you just do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it faster that's true that's</font>

1137
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:13,839
so I mean the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no</font>

1138
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:16,819
difference if he<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it varies because</font>

1139
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:18,890
the you have to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the path from an</font>

1140
01:00:16,819 --> 01:00:22,069
end to end point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of view so even if</font>

1141
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:25,430
transiently is strict SPF not CDs

1142
01:00:22,069 --> 01:00:29,180
rerouted on the same path that tilf a

1143
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:31,609
may take the controller also ended the

1144
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:34,190
head end if so<font color="#E5E5E5"> then is responsible for</font>

1145

1147
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,839
because the constraint path has changed

1148
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:46,549
stiffened the real requirement is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1149
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:48,529
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear to me an end customer he need</font>

1153
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:57,020
requirements are met or you know the

1154
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:59,328
requirement has to be something of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1155
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:02,630
sort and not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't want and we</font>

1156
01:00:59,329 --> 01:01:04,640
it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like transmission like</font>

1157

01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:09,710
operator when we are ordering some<font color="#CCCCCC"> WDM</font>

1159
01:01:07,339 --> 01:01:12,410
links we can ask for protected links or

1160
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:15,170
non-protected links because we are doing

1161
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:17,960
the backyard on our side<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we are</font>

1162
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:20,180
ordering another link which is using<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1163
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,160
completely another path so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1164
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:25,069
really similar so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes we are</font>

1165
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:27,259
setting for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet links about</font>

our mpls networks that we resell to

1167
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:32,299
evaporators so because if you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> north</font>

1168
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:34,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">side it can change at any time right so</font>

1169
01:01:32,299 --> 01:01:35,780
use extreme guarantee that you know it's

1170
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:38,720
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> path that's going to be that's</font>

1171
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:40,369
true time so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a yes that's one</font>

1172
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:44,470
of the drawback of the Nazis that we

1173
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:44,470
need to to take care of yeah uh

1174
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:51,160
will be our house of having i have

1175
01:01:48,519 --> 01:01:53,828
several comments the first is that it

1176
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:58,328
can you clarify your the application

1177
01:01:53,829 --> 01:02:00,369
scenario of these draft the first active

1178
01:01:58,329 --> 01:02:04,390
user you the first you the code you got

1179
01:02:00,369 --> 01:02:07,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">these two of the srt and SRB this one</font>

1180
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:09,339
scenario a secondary school is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tea and</font>

1181
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:12,430
what secondly routine traffic

1182
01:02:09,339 --> 01:02:15,460
engineering yes envy ogre one second I

1183
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:17,500
mean such a scenario y si Nardo<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accuse</font>

1184
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:19,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">the three option you tell me which way</font>

1185
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:22,200
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get this usual and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

1186
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:25,269
solve this usual<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay in these</font>

1187
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:27,910
applications in our the first one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1188
01:02:25,269 --> 01:02:31,839
coexistence<font color="#CCCCCC"> that IP network a</font>

1189
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:33,788
coexistence of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SRT and SRB</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this</font>

1190
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:37,990
is one scenario second is out be but

1191
01:02:33,789 --> 01:02:40,539
with less the effort oh okay so okay our

1192
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:43,089
word may be different from your world ok

1193
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:46,990
the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> way is that the coexist of</font>

1194
01:02:43,089 --> 01:02:50,558
our DB and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sr PE as our past the effort</font>

1195
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:52,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok our DP also your eyes rdp also you</font>

1196
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:55,869
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> cease to you in this network life in</font>

1197
01:02:52,690 --> 01:03:00,009
a second the third way totally new

1198
01:02:55,869 --> 01:03:02,529
network for sr so<font color="#CCCCCC"> three scenario what a</font>

1199
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:05,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">scenario you get this usual and probe</font>

1200
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:10,359
hold the solution it's 4 SOT it's for

1201
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:13,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">SLT path</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok SRT pass for a San Sebastian</font>

1202
01:03:10,359 --> 01:03:16,390
ok ok ok ok great<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so the second why</font>

1203
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:20,890
you that my comments to you that if you

1204
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:23,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">to this requirement ok I tell you the</font>

1205
01:03:20,890 --> 01:03:23,940
another scene Oh

1206
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:32,640
the comments that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this one if</font>

1207
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:37,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make this work in your this</font>

1208
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:38,910
is a make this in your network you I say

1209
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:41,790
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this later so you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1210
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:45,420
either standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> instead of information</font>

1211
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:47,579
or experimental or the best practice you

1212
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:52,799
wonder this to be a standard standard

1213
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:56,609
yes why I can you tell me this one I

1214
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:59,660
didn't because I want this particular

1215
01:03:56,609 --> 01:04:02,970
option to be implemented by<font color="#E5E5E5"> or windows</font>

1216
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:05,578
ok so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's need to be a standard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok we</font>

1217
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:08,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">need a joint up a bit ok we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us out</font>

1218
01:04:05,579 --> 01:04:09,930
deployability<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok to win either some of</font>

1219
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:13,349
the protocol used engines for this one

1220
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:14,819
or not it will depend of the solutions

1221
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:18,059
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will take for example if we go</font>

1222
01:04:14,819 --> 01:04:20,250
to the additional flag within the not

1223
01:04:18,059 --> 01:04:22,260
cede we will need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to update the igp</font>

1224
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:24,540
extension so it will depend of the

1225
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:26,309
scenarios that we will take ok true

1226
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:29,400
today I don't know if we will need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1227
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:32,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">change something or not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok use this why</font>

1228
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:34,650
I think I no no III scene<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you until</font>

1229
01:04:32,339 --> 01:04:36,660
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a protocol you stranger maybe</font>

1230
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:38,880
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a necessary i'm not thinking about</font>

1231
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:41,368
anything today I'm just exposing<font color="#CCCCCC"> various</font>

1232
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:43,559
options<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe there are additional sore</font>

1233
01:04:41,369 --> 01:04:46,079
let's analyze and then we will come<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1234
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:48,720
a solution ok so we are not as a stage

1235
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">of solution now ok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will go through the</font>

1236
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:57,740
options<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your draft only talk with</font>

1237
01:04:50,760 --> 01:05:01,339
you thank you and you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

1238
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:01,339
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font>

1239
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:22,800
hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stefan Oprah</font>

1240
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:25,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cisco so these draft came up after I</font>

1241
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:27,550
would say a description of a use case of

1242
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:30,940
a requirement has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> expressed in the</font>

1243
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:35,470
Middle East and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirement was next</font>

1244
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:39,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide the ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to deploy on a single</font>

1245
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:42,220
router multiple addresses of the router

1246
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:45,130
associated with different services but

1247
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:48,009
all those addresses would use the same

1248
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:49,990
set now the segment erotic architecture

1249
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:52,150
is pretty clear one graphics one said

1250
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:53,950
and we don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change the</font>

1251
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:56,770
architecture<font color="#E5E5E5"> also because we think there</font>

1252
01:05:53,950 --> 01:06:00,430
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously an architecture compliant</font>

1253
01:05:56,770 --> 01:06:03,580
solution to this and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where the</font>

1254
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:06,819
solution is documented in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this draft now</font>

1255
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:08,940
we send this draft I mean we submit it

1256
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:12,190
we send it to mailing list and

1257
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:13,990
surprisingly the individual that

1258
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:18,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">expressed the requirement in the use</font>

1259
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:22,020
case never came<font color="#E5E5E5"> back so I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know so</font>

1260
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:25,330
next night the<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution is very simple</font>

1261
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:27,940
instead of advertising the prefix with

1262
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:30,400
the set you advertise the prefix with a

1263
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:34,390
new piece of information into which you

1264
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:36,790
encode would ease the sage and the

1265
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:41,049
prefix owning that said you want to

1266
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:44,109
recurse so it's pretty simple we defined

1267
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:47,619
a new sub TV in both protocols ospf<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

1268
01:06:44,109 --> 01:06:50,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">ASIS we call this the segment rodding</font>

1269
01:06:47,619 --> 01:06:56,349
recursing the information next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide and</font>

1270
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:58,869
we encode the the global said that this

1271
01:06:56,349 --> 01:07:00,880
preface should use and this global stage

1272
01:06:58,869 --> 01:07:02,790
in fact belongs to another projects

1273
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:06,130
that's why you need a different encoding

1274
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:08,020
for for expressing that of course you

1275
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:10,270
have the usual flags and algorithm and

1276
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:12,130
optionally you can also add the local

1277
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:15,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">state let's have a look at the picture</font>

1278
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:18,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">next slide so this is what we want to</font>

1279
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:21,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">encode in in writing protocols but let's</font>

1280
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:24,070
skip this one for now let's focus on the

1281
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:27,310
functionality so on the right side you

1282
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:30,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a rather rather a which has a</font>

1283
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:31,390

the notes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1285
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:35,078
eighteen thousand and two and then you

1286
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:38,019
may have multiple other prefixes

1287
01:07:35,079 --> 01:07:39,339
representing different services and the

1288
01:07:38,019 --> 01:07:42,129
requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has been expressed at</font>

1289
01:07:39,339 --> 01:07:45,130
the beginning was I want those services

1290
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:48,130
to be reachable through the same set so

1291
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:49,869
that I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> taught okay just one single</font>

1292
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:52,150
said for all those prefixes because

1293
01:07:49,869 --> 01:07:54,460
apparently there are platform that still

1294
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:58,510
have problems and allocating a certain

1295
01:07:54,460 --> 01:08:01,450
range of labels<font color="#E5E5E5"> now what we do here is</font>

1296
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:03,819
that instead of advertising all those

1297
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:05,799
individual service preferences with all

1298
01:08:03,819 --> 01:08:07,599
the same side which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not compliant to</font>

the segment<font color="#CCCCCC"> ronique architecture we are</font>

1305
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:31,659
optionally you can have also local<font color="#CCCCCC"> seed</font>

1306
01:08:28,448 --> 01:08:34,988
so some of them are with a local seed

1307
01:08:31,658 --> 01:08:37,929
and some and one is without so reading

1308

the is is LSP<font color="#CCCCCC"> illustrated there you can</font>

1315
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:06,399
a of course it's another router and for

1316
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:08,710
the prefixes that have been advertised

1317
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:12,339
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the segment rodding recursing info</font>

1318
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:14,799
sub TLB you see there what is the label

1319
01:09:12,339 --> 01:09:17,408
that correspond to that service based on

1320
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:21,100
the encoding received in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing</font>

1321
01:09:17,408 --> 01:09:23,559
protocol so the requirements eased rests

1322
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:26,859
you have multiple services that in fact

1323
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:30,279
may use the same set still you are

1324
01:09:26,859 --> 01:09:32,350
compliant because prefix has a say

1325
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:35,020
dundas it belongs only to one prefix and

1326
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:40,659
so you can multiplex by doing this kind

1327
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:43,690
of recursion in fact next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide so this</font>

1328
01:09:40,658 --> 01:09:45,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">is just the text that illustrates that</font>

01:09:43,689 --> 01:09:48,698
mean that explains the

1330
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:51,790
the picture so next slide the benefits

1331
01:09:48,698 --> 01:09:54,370
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said it addresses the requirements</font>

1332
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:59,019
of limiting the number of labels you

1333

we are going to have obviously the

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I one as the question you</font>

will see no not least if the draft that

1391
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:06,640
you proposed matches exactly what is

1392
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:08,530
described here fine so it means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

1393
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:12,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">are in agreement and then we merger to</font>

1395
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:17,590
so that you for this what happens I hope

1396
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:20,080
at some of these the<font color="#E5E5E5"> description or the</font>

01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:33,790
that's my comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Dave Allen</font>

1400
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:35,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">Erickson</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i will apologize in advance for</font>

1401
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:39,010
not having read the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft just one minor</font>

1402
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:42,340
clarification and that is is I presume

1403
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:44,500
PHP for example could not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> used such</font>

1404
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:48,880
that the local label would inherit

1405
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:51,640
context from no no you said you could

1406
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:53,590
still use PHP that's that's fine

1407
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:55,719
especially if you advertise also a local

1408
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:59,460
label so the packet will be received

1409
01:13:55,719 --> 01:14:02,230
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the with the local label so it's</font>

1410
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:04,090
but how would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you disambiguate the local</font>

1411
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:06,669
label space from the global label space

1412
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:09,760
without them if you do PHP when the

1413
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:11,440
packet comes to you where I mean you are

1414
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">the rudder who are located that local</font>

1415
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,389
label so you know that

1416
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:16,519
local label what is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meaning in the</font>

1417
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:18,080
semantics of that local level but if

1418
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:20,420
you've also received the same label

1419
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:23,840
value as a global level no but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

1420
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:26,360
PHP and you are you receive<font color="#E5E5E5"> that label</font>

1421
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:29,810
you know that that label is on the local

1422
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:31,610
range label and so you have allocated it

1423
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:35,000
so you know what is the function
