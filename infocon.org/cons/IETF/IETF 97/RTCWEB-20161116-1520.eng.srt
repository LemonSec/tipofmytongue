00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:14,200
we're also looking for someone to take a

00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:21,399
ring to Mount Doom anyone Aroldis

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:24,000
volunteered and all he really<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not do</font>

00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:24,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably</font>

5
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:07,789
it's not self-evident is this is a clip

6
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:15,229
from a kpop video that shows a young

<font color="#E5E5E5">Korean man waiting although not many of</font>

8
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:29,000
us are young Korean men we were waiting

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,789
received however a mary has sent an

11
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,589
updated video or gift rather for me to

12
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:47,090
to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to so you give me just a</font>

us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

let's see if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go over here and refresh</font>

16
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:56,760
it there we go actual career did I just

17
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:06,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">hear you say the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is over always</font>

18
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:08,340
right according to<font color="#CCCCCC"> wikipedia it's a</font>

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,850
small town than<font color="#CCCCCC"> Poland but that's just</font>

20
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:16,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I changed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

21
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:19,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">welcome back to ITF 97 here we are and</font>

22
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,709
RTC web again it's we're planning on

23
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:28,710
restful no no real controversy today

24
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:34,560
however we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> term i like the next</font>

25
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:36,120
monthly apparently you're going to have

26
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,240
to read this in korean it's still the

27
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,830
note well it just happens to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the note</font>

28
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,510
well incur actually we might be paying

29
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:45,810
more attention to it because now really

30
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:48,929
the RFC 53 78 really pops doesn't it

31
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:53,340
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i remind you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that whether you're</font>

32
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:56,400
here in seoul in chicago in prague in

where that we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> after that seem</font>

34
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,410
to recall this applies if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get up and talk you have to be aware</font>

37
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:11,490
relevant to your contributions so uh

38
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:17,310
really you couldn't keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> going guys i</font>

00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:20,220
don't know i'm taking direction work<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

40
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,720
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to this way so the agenda</font>

41
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,670
which will eventually see up here has

42
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">been modified to add a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new day friday</font>

43
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:33,080
well this friday is new to us it's sort

44
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like a car that's been gently used</font>

45
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:39,690
actually i believe oh good even better

46
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,369
what are you doing no no how do you

47
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,860
always think<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup</font>

48
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,169
bizarre anybody who thinks she was

49
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,110
unwise for letting<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sean touch my left</font>

50
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:58,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">ear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is your hand right now because I'm</font>

51
00:04:49,110 --> 00:05:01,470
beginning to have some regrets what

52
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:04,080
alright so the first step is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to review</font>

53
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:12,030
those those items of pain which we went

54
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:14,130
into on our<font color="#E5E5E5"> first meeting related to Jay</font>

55
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,500
set then we'll do IP handling effect and

56
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:19,020
then draft code called Copeland urgency

57
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,030
web PDP IDP because its author is

58
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,760
leaving the current theory is that on

59
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,799
Friday we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will handle any overflow items</font>

60
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,440
from today's meeting there'll be a new

61
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,070
puppy picture I swear it might be otters

62
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,229
the river puppy will go into the

63
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:37,260
overview draft and security architecture

64
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:41,820
grounds now of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course if we finish today</font>

65
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:45,630
you get Friday back so you have that

66
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,580
inducement uh I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first order</font>

67
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,010
of business is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cullen if you would come</font>

68
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,280
up and repeat your spiel from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> M</font>

69
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:56,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">music session to make sure that this is</font>

70
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:59,460
copacetic with RTC web as well and then

71
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:02,070
we'll turn it over to occur and Harold

72
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:09,810
for reviewing with us the the action

73
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:12,120
item<font color="#CCCCCC"> baby</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so um the sort of newest</font>

74
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,460
text in jessup is the section<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 that</font>

75
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,760
tells you about where this RTP packet

76
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,770
goes and how you get it to the right

77
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:23,610
transceiver based on various bits you

78
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:25,919
may find in it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a proposal how to</font>

79
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,740
resolve this after a great conversation

80
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,560
with Colin and<font color="#E5E5E5"> magnuson Jonathan this</font>

81
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,510
morning is we were going to split most

82
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,169
of that text or what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to do is</font>

83
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:39,180
proposed making to pull requests and

84
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:41,219
peter<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably typing on one of them</font>

85
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,289
right now because he's way ahead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I</font>

86
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:47,130
did it get hub clone of the other one

87
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:49,050
that's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I am we're going to</font>

88
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:52,919
make a PR to take a bunch of that text

89
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:55,200
and move it to the bundle draft so

90
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:57,719
there'd be two PRS 1 / j sup 14 bundle

91
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,520
um the<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm would stay largely the</font>

92
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,840
same it's like the variation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get to</font>

93
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,490
in a second but largely the same

94
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,000
algorithm from an implementers point of

95
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:09,330
view we would refactor a little bit the

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,610
way we describe the art idiot right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

97
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,800
the text refers<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know the SSRC you</font>

98
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,650
find in the packet and that really maps

99
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,230
up with the RTP stream they are you know

100
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,120
when you get an RTP packet it's in an

101
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,800
RTP stream and that RTP stream is

102
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,990
identified by the SRC well sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of turn</font>

103
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,330
up use rephrase<font color="#CCCCCC"> the terminology a little</font>

104
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:31,350
bit make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it easier to to align with our</font>

105
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,820
TP terminology by using RTP stream we

106
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,220
will explain in the bundle draft how you

107
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,659
get from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an end section we won't</font>

108
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,790
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific terminology that</font>

109
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,440
would be used in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> J subtract then in</font>

110
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,670
the J sub draft will refer back to the

111
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,310
bundle draft because we already do and

112
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,570
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say that you know once you</font>

113
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">get it to the right m section that</font>

114
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:50,250
corresponds to a transceiver and now you

115
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:52,020
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what to do it so that's if that's</font>

116
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,430
mostly just a here's how we're going to

117
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,840
move the text around and clarify it a

118
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,700
little bit not change the other the

119
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:04,619
algorithm change that with that opposing

120
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:07,770
making is right now if you have you can

121
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,330
use the payload type as a hint if you

122
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,799
don't have any other<font color="#CCCCCC"> information to know</font>

123
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">which in line that should go to you</font>

124
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,980
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSRC signaling or you don't</font>

125
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">have that any mids in the packets or</font>

126
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,070
something you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the payload type</font>

127
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,530
to figure out which M line to send it to

128
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,719
if the all the payload types are unique

129
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:24,239
across every in line and what the

130
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,670
giraffe says right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now is that if it's</font>

131
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,440
not unique across all the in line so you

132
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,180
go to the first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the change that</font>

133
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,669
we're proposing making is to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

134
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,049
it's not unique you discard the packet

135
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:35,939
if you don't know which one it is

136
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:38,490
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Magnus pointed out that this was</font>

137
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,380
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a.m. you know non sensible</font>

138
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,940
location if you're trying to deem oxys

139
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,500
things based on payload types and your

140
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,150
payload types aren't unique across the

141
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,980
pay lot that<font color="#CCCCCC"> M lines like something's</font>

142
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,140
gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> really badly rock and when</font>

143
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,700
something's gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> really badly wrong just</font>

144
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,900
letting it sort of work in some weird

145
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,460
way is<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably not the right answer</font>

146
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,260
probably getting an error like having it

147
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,460
not work would be better so that's the

148
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,980
only proposed change I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty</font>

149
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,870
minor I've gone through that with I

150
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the people would probably</font>

151
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,050
be worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up about it they must seem</font>

152
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I think it's pretty minor</font>

153
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:09,150
change that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not cause you think so</font>

154
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,100
two questions you know people

155
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright with that basic technical change</font>

156
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,240
composing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and to the algorithm and then</font>

157
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,069
the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is you know in any</font>

158
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,570
objections to this basic idea of doing

159
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,070
these two PRS I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get these</font>

160
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,480
reviewed pretty quickly afterwards I

161
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,490
mean I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can agree to them do</font>

162
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:29,250
they see them but that's that's the

163
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:30,930
basic plan any objections excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

164
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,650
Peter and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will keep working on that</font>

165
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,650
and thank you

166
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:49,650
and just confirm your sentence the list

167
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:51,810
not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> PS and get up oh we will yes</font>

168
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:54,689
yes most definitely the links to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PRS</font>

169
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:59,339
and github will be sent to the list I'll

170
00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:06,240
do a little better than that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this</font>

171
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:16,050
is far too<font color="#E5E5E5"> long it's we had a we had a</font>

172
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:18,720
really buggy problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> Henry John really</font>

173
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:22,949
apart<font color="#E5E5E5"> Renata boba says this mean Petey</font>

174
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,240
overlap is illegal and bundle and as on

175
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,970
the previous topic sorry i missed the

176
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,290
comment and the answer is no it means

177
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,840
that you actually have to use mid like

178
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:34,199
you're supposed to and not try to use PT

179
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">/ quickie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're doing PT overlap you</font>

180
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:42,300
have to use mid but you have to use mid

181
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:46,770
anyway so that's not a huge hardship ok

182
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:49,520
back to invalidate being offers we had a

183
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:54,569
small job to make and we made it<font color="#E5E5E5"> bigger</font>

184
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:58,170
this is RT C Webb okay next I'd problem

185
00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:00,930
when is enough for valid you see the

186
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:04,410
code it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear that why anyone will</font>

187
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:09,270
ever do that and it's not defined to be

188
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:11,459
sure to work and it's a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

189
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,189
things may have changed so that so the

190
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,190
first offer was a stupid thing to do

191
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:16,190
next

192
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:33,839
next slide or<font color="#CCCCCC"> option is considered next</font>

193
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:35,489
solution a invalidate all all all the

194
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,410
all the offers every time you call

195
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:40,320
create off you can't do any little<font color="#E5E5E5"> hole</font>

196
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:43,079
stuff no changes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Krista code that's</font>

197
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,089
really nice they saw almost everything

198
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:50,399
we say here apply to create answer to

199
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:52,649
next or we could say that when you

200
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:59,339
commit to offer when you lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> that local</font>

201
00:11:52,649 --> 00:12:04,380
description then well magic should

202
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:14,089
happen yeah we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> just been another's</font>

203
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:14,089
on the projector we can't see it all<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

204
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:26,420
so some someone zoomed out the projector

205
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:29,100
attic<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hey that's good give it and</font>

206
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:31,529
the objection we had the solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> be was</font>

207
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,860
that if the first slide describes a

208
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:38,540
problem this does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this still has the</font>

209
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:43,589
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's caught that next</font>

210
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:45,240
solution see<font color="#E5E5E5"> well remove set remove that</font>

211
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:47,850
local description it's a stupid call

212
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:54,180
anyway instead we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should make a call</font>

213
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:56,220
saying call or offer well the problem

214
00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:01,469
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is that it requires rewriting</font>

215
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:07,230
every every application existence which

216
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:09,690
is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of not popular anymore next and</font>

217
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:12,480
of course then we come up with solution

218
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:14,819
d which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of like solution see</font>

219
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is backwards compatible yeah</font>

220
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:21,930
backwards compatibility of that so

221
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">subtle local description does something</font>

222
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:27,180
interesting it will do what create offer

223
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:29,189
it will set the local description to

224
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,130
what create of created last and the

225
00:13:29,189 --> 00:13:39,260
story

226
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:41,450
and of course that<font color="#CCCCCC"> means that colon</font>

227
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:45,319
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> office could actually be made</font>

228
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:49,970
optional why should you do it the turn

229
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:56,870
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be one little wrinkle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Pierre</font>

230
00:13:49,970 --> 00:14:00,710
answer with Pierre answer create answer

231
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:04,130
cannot know whether what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you intended</font>

232
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:07,370
was a PR answer or an<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer that's the</font>

233
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:09,140
only reason why I said why create set

234
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:15,620
local description Neil needs not mad at

235
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:17,540
all so scratch it so we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah we</font>

236
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,270
can make it make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> good I mean this is</font>

237
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,910
for orientation because this is strictly

238
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:27,860
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> WebRTC matter it's just a matter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

239
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:29,719
the shape of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP of the API not it's</font>

240
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,620
not about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what anything that goes into</font>

241
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:36,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">jsf at all they kind of subtle this the</font>

242
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:39,170
thing we're suggesting is that and

243
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:41,390
create local description invalidates all

244
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,310
previous offers and a way we're

245
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:48,400
suggesting it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done in the API</font>

246
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:54,709
is we actually pass it behind the scenes

247
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:57,560
set local description has no power<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

248
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,270
change it and that means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that local</font>

249
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:04,910
description can be made simpler next

250
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:08,000
life so instead of having<font color="#E5E5E5"> set local</font>

251
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:10,969
description take an argument assess yes

252
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sdp first what kind of operation of</font>

253
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:19,220
the earth men always be you just say

254
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:22,760
what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of operation is this so apply</font>

255
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:28,410
that across browsers for backwards

256
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:33,899
compatibility sake next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide we</font>

257
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:36,120
say if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an offer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we'll eat</font>

258
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:38,579
that too and take the argument outlets

259
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:43,829
and if you send us a long as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> P will</font>

260
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:46,050
complain and next<font color="#E5E5E5"> time around we'll make</font>

261
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:49,550
it illegal because that's what you do

262
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,550
after having complained for a while and

263
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:56,969
then we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a set local description</font>

264
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:59,819
with an offer answer appear answer no

265
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:01,860
more let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all the way through it</font>

266
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:04,019
yep we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all the way through</font>

267
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:13,199
it and then take take this yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next</font>

268
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:18,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">time next time so the nice thing is that</font>

269
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:21,329
no app gets broken for anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

270
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">guaranteed to work today there are cases</font>

271
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:25,319
where things might have worked today

272
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,939
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure why there should ever</font>

273
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:29,490
work but might they might have work

274
00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:32,399
today where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will love now we're</font>

275
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:34,949
broken but then they were not guaranteed

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">to work anyway and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last thing is</font>

277
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:41,609
this the app gets simpler let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> back yet</font>

278
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:44,969
simple will cook up a pull request

279
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:49,910
between us to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> WebRTC spec and get</font>

280
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:52,350
that in there if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not cut down by</font>

Justin<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next it's a bit increase it</font>

283
00:16:57,689 --> 00:17:02,670
yes but since we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be backwards</font>

284
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:07,579
compatible names are going to the

00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:07,579
strange lose a few next

286
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:15,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">ah yeah that's more more detailing we</font>

287
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,480
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could be even more creative I</font>

288
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:22,680
mean I'll meet<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> argument</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say that</font>

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:29,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's implied except for except except</font>

290
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:33,120
for the prl circus yeah next yeah so

291
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:39,690
that's what we recommend now Justin I

292
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:45,750
think so perhaps it like that its back

293
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:47,310
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> try it hey everyone so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one other</font>

294
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:53,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">case and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess that probably still</font>

295
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:54,899
works is the rollback case yep<font color="#E5E5E5"> lil back</font>

296
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">should roll back rolls back to all the</font>

297
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,320
dough is rolled back to previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> table</font>

298
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">states sure but you need to be able to</font>

299
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:05,760
pass in and roll back to the setting

300
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:08,459
local or set remote yeah yes that's

301
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">right you forgot difficult to a</font>

302
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,360
dimension of that magic string and

303
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:20,700
that's it's now going to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> magic sting</font>

304
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:23,550
outlet sounds good<font color="#CCCCCC"> christer uh is this</font>

305
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:27,330
somehow related to to the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

306
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:29,760
the mailing list of removing / answer PR

307
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:33,060
answer all together and if that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

308
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,220
happen would that somehow impact your

309
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:39,960
recommendation here or wouldn't even be

310
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:42,840
an issue or it would not since Justin

311
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:47,070
mention the rollback case it would not

312
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:50,520
impact the the it would not impact the

313
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,899
details here I hoped for a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

314
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,180
simplification until we remember

315
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fear answer but since we also a</font>

316
00:18:54,180 --> 00:19:03,210
rollback we have no more simplifications

317
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:04,439
to make it doesn't matter so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Colin</font>

318
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was going to mention the role actuator</font>

319
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,560
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> coverage and i saw i like this</font>

320
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:12,990
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sounds like a good path to</font>

321
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:14,850
me but what win it you know the answer

322
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,640
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just set the local</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stp it start</font>

323
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,409
sending stuff with the new local stp so

324
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,510
does the timing of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font>

325
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,500
the timing like when is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the timing of</font>

326
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,810
when you start

327
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,060
using that new thing and Union proposal

328
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:29,490
deep is it when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you called create offer</font>

329
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,649
or when is it or is it when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you call the</font>

330
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:34,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">set answer when the quilt set local</font>

331
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:36,390
description<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it just cashes the</font>

332
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,700
value and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it applies it at the same</font>

333
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,100
time is it currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> as if you'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> passed</font>

334
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,560
it in yes so instead of cashing the

335
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,990
information that this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only value</font>

336
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:49,620
should accept it catches the information

337
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:54,690
itself and justifies it this sounds good

338
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:56,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">i like it simpler</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Denver at this this</font>

339
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,890
sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> good just a quick question if you</font>

340
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,900
call create offer and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> call that</font>

341
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:05,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">local</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> description with answer is the</font>

342
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:11,100
string what happens and the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

343
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:14,010
as you that depends on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> states if I'm</font>

344
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:17,550
just curious I let me mumble because

345
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:20,730
create offer in have have remote

346
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:25,230
description state should<font color="#CCCCCC"> not do anything</font>

347
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:27,090
sensible I forget whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spec</font>

348
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,700
actually assess that it's the Turner's

349
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:31,530
matter what that crazy answer should

350
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,830
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> offer shouldn't be possible to do</font>

351
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:36,600
insert in there in the habitable

352
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:39,270
description states rights as good

353
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,879
evening the reason i was asking is

354
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:43,620
because the way sort of simple current

355
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,930
code works is that whether you call

356
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,820
create offer a create answer you can

357
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,710
just pass whatever you get back into set

358
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,760
local description you don't actually you

359
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,500
know your code may not need to know

360
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether it's an offer or an answer now</font>

361
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,530
your code needs to know whether it's an

362
00:20:53,730 --> 00:21:16,140
offer an answer and get it right it's

363
00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:18,300
open<font color="#CCCCCC"> have live well yeah yeah sure this</font>

364
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:21,030
seems like it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> fractured so so</font>

365
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:23,760
fractionally more complicated

366
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,840
applications um by the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean you</font>

367
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,629
could you realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you could also</font>

368
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:32,850
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> replace</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing that is emitted</font>

369
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:34,169
with a string offer over answer yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

370
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:37,559
could even<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

371
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:43,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's the P thoughts yeah operation or</font>

372
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:44,668
whatever the<font color="#E5E5E5"> team name is you couldn't</font>

373
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:50,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">just go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the original</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem one</font>

374
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:52,470
sorry oh hey yeah so I kind of agree

375
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:56,609
with Lorenzo that the the string is an

376
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:58,739
argument<font color="#CCCCCC"> seems kind of ambiguous don't</font>

377
00:21:56,609 --> 00:22:00,899
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that if the</font>

378
00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:04,230
application thinks it's passing in like

379
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:09,748
<font color="#E5E5E5">X that like it's not going to get X that</font>

380
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:13,169
like something breaks yes we should so I

381
00:22:09,749 --> 00:22:15,659
have the buckle at them so basically

382
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:17,580
whatever the last thing the last

383
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:19,889
argument to create offer what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

384
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,239
either create offer<font color="#CCCCCC"> Korean secrete</font>

385
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:24,418
answer or whatever the last thing that

386
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:25,889
was called we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> assume that's</font>

387
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:33,149
what's being passed into that local

388
00:22:25,889 --> 00:22:35,488
description yes here's Thatcher well I

389
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:37,799
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would work that if you passed</font>

390
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:39,509
an offer they would apply the last offer

391
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:41,759
you created if you passed an answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

392
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:43,859
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would apply the last answer</font>

393
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,539
you created you wouldn't call create

394
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:47,699
offer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then pass an answer and expect</font>

395
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:49,739
the percent local description answer and

396
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,320
expect the offer to be applied yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

397
00:22:49,739 --> 00:22:55,350
would think a cache of two things right

398
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:59,279
which is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> under a big deal but if you</font>

399
00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:01,350
do pass in an object that says offer and

400
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:04,200
then there's sdp we're going to check

401
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:06,480
them that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> HDP mashes the cached stp</font>

402
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:12,830
and if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't match then we explode</font>

403
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:16,679
I do that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's why it's yes</font>

404
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:20,428
explore this in the promise rejected and

405
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:22,919
if anybody tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pass in the value</font>

406
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:26,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the current current local</font>

407
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:30,570
description as setting local description

408
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:35,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">I guess we would explode not clear I</font>

409
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:37,080
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should yeah i mean my only</font>

410
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,359
concern is really like i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a big fan</font>

411
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,960
of the string i think i'd rather see the

412
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:47,490
object with the tight filled in and just

413
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,380
not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDP parameter and accept that as</font>

414
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:53,490
you know an alternative to passing in

415
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:56,760
the type and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sdp that seems a little</font>

416
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:58,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit unless</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I know a little bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

417
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,820
consistent with what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

418
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right already right now just</font>

419
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,178
saying if you omit the actual ftp

420
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:08,070
parameter we just use the one that we

421
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:10,200
think you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use now</font>

422
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:12,870
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about doing strings</font>

423
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:16,679
is actually that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you only need to it</font>

424
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:18,629
which it could say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if there</font>

425
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:25,980
isn't anything cash<font color="#E5E5E5"> but just co-create</font>

426
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:27,240
offer for you but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a I think</font>

427
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:31,830
that's a bridge it's like that gugabox

428
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:33,480

heading down you know a complicated path

432
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:43,860
like I think we should fix the problem

433
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:44,970
we're sort of charge to fix here and not

434
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,979
decide that we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let go</font>

00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:55,650
it whether we think it's a string or an

437
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,630
object<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has a string or he knew more</font>

00:24:55,650 --> 00:25:00,030
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's basically the same</font>

439
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:03,540
thing though and we can discuss that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

440
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:07,710
the w3c right sir for this one group

441
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:09,870
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a question of whether doing</font>

that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the w3c solves this problem that</font>

445
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:22,020
completely lost on what the problem is

446
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:23,429
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think this salt because it seems</font>

447
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the case you're talking about</font>

448
00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:26,460
here already if we didn't change

449
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:27,870
anything in the draft when you went to

450
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:31,200
apply that it would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

451
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:33,000
generation of this SDP doesn't match the

452
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,910
preview that the generation of the the

453
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,470
create offer like like this is wrong I

454
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:40,020
mean you modified the SDP in a way

455
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:41,730
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not allowed so I believe I'm not</font>

456
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,530
seeing what<font color="#CCCCCC"> change your actually</font>

457
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,850
proposing i believe the draft currently

458
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:47,030
creates an error if you did the

459
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:50,550
situation you're currently talking about

460
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:52,110
if the if since I think image off then

461
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,620
we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kills the bed already</font>

462
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,620
wouldn't

463
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,860
if the people who are closing the bugs

464
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,539
understood what we're talking about

465
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,039
which would not be me I don't understand

466
00:26:01,539 --> 00:26:06,100
the problem yet then<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe the bug would</font>

467
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">be closed yes but I I again I mean I am</font>

468
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,519
not understanding the problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

469
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,379
believe then you generate a generation

470
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:13,870
of sdp and then you generate another

471
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:15,070
generation of stp when you set local the

472
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:17,049
current text that says you're not

473
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:19,928
allowed to change the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdp will go whoa</font>

474
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:21,879
dude that stp is changed because it'll

475
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:24,159
have a different things in it and it

476
00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:29,230
won't work a bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the version</font>

477
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:30,759
number that will have rotated are you

478
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">real</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm wrong you may believe the spec</font>

479
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:34,509
says that but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> point I've asked you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

480
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,158
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> me the exact Texas as you can't do</font>

481
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:38,080
that it doesn't say it doesn't say you

482
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,960
can't it doesn't say the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> recent one</font>

483
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:44,230
it just says you can't change<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so that</font>

484
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,789
that was the discussion on Monday I<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope</font>

485
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,679
the same thing you were you're thinking

486
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:49,779
but the I mean maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a comparison</font>

487
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,389
seems there have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> last time that's</font>

488
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:55,600
resolution a right is like a resolution

489
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:58,689
a is is simply say was always meant that

490
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:02,049
and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this reference Lucy</font>

491
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:04,029
resolution yep solution a is the same as

492
00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:13,990
solution d but without without smacking

493
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:15,730
around with interface the problem all

494
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:17,649
you see the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

495
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:19,539
solutions is they ignore roll back so it

496
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:21,610
makes it a little bit harder to analyze

497
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:24,360
these but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is right on</font>

498
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:31,360
create offer but wrong on create answer

499
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:34,240
but ah I don't know again I'm I guess I

500
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,309
I favor the the simplest version of

501
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,710
fixing this would be something that

502
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:43,080
generally that an error when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> passed</font>

503
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:47,259
in sdp that was not a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rollback and not</font>

504
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:49,240
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most recent thing yeah it had</font>

505
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:51,429
been changed since the most recent what

506
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,749
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would propose is when the texture</font>

507
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:55,929
we have where you said you can't change

508
00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:57,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">it we add the word can't change it from</font>

509
00:27:55,929 --> 00:27:59,350
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recent thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most recent</font>

510
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">great i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer would be like I</font>

511
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:03,908
think that's when a minumum patch to

512
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:08,889
Jason that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sounds excellent yes they can</font>

513
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:10,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">this guessing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> web work is finished Adam</font>

514
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:11,770
rose I want to come and<font color="#CCCCCC"> speak up in</font>

515
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,210
and you know I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a bike</font>

516
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:14,440
shed but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak in favor of</font>

517
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:17,140
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I think what we found here</font>

518
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,850
is there's a circumstance that everyone

519
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,920
thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> said something someone</font>

520
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:22,240
discovered it said something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else and we</font>

521
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,380
should just make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> say the thing we all</font>

522
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,510
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it said in the first place</font>

523
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:29,460
because anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just like</font>

524
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:29,460
baking late changes to no good purpose

525
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,890
well just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ourselves of we had</font>

526
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:38,200
almost the exact same discussion on

527
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:40,120
Monday and there was concerns over

528
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,480
breaking existing apps so we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

529
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,639
have a study group or whatever we called

530
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,230
it and the study group came back and

531
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,720
said yes we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do a but if we do this</font>

532
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:54,690
tweak to the API we can roll out change

533
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,690
that would prevent breaking anybody

534
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:03,250
right how much how does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> work it's</font>

535
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:06,040
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> but how how is avoid breaking</font>

536
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:08,350
somebody who like<font color="#E5E5E5"> COD create offer more</font>

537
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:13,350
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> once and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where that currently</font>

538
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:13,350
works that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> no now stop working it</font>

539
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:21,280
well if you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

540
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:23,800
the steps if we basically tell app

541
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,590
developers to use a slightly different

542
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:30,629
API where they pass in the type instead

543
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:33,070
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole session description then</font>

544
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:36,760
after that point we can start rejecting

545
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:38,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and it will give them time to</font>

546
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,440
switch over to a state where they

547
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:43,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't blow up great but i get if we</font>

548
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell them to if we need to tell them to</font>

549
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:47,470
change their behavior then we can do

550
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is for people</font>

551
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:52,240
whose code is already written it will

552
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:55,510
not change behavior yeah yeah Adam<font color="#CCCCCC"> Roche</font>

553
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,060
again not to put too fine a point on it

554
00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:01,750
but the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was doing that doesn't</font>

555
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:11,980
work in firefox anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's good</font>

556
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:15,460
right John flags I mean it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems like if</font>

557
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:17,650
we do solution a writing a trivial

558
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:21,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript library to implement d on top</font>

559
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:24,370
of a is you know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> half an hour's</font>

560
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:25,870
work so I don't see why we need

561
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:33,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">worried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about baking it into the</font>

562
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:36,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">browsers that way it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> necessary so</font>

563
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:39,280
just to be clear if we don't care about

564
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,690
breaking anybody then we wouldn't have

565
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,160
needed the study group at all we would

566
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:44,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">have gone with a which is kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

567
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,300
we decided on Monday<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we did the</font>

we'd really like to thank everybody

who's already done a review of this is

618
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:23,629
there anybody who's read the most recent

00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:38,299
do a working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> last call on this</font>

already reviewed this current version

expect to take it out thank you

626
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:11,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay we know the IP address handling</font>

about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> nightie f95 there is a</font>

629
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:19,739
specific block of text you'll see here

630
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:22,290
as old<font color="#E5E5E5"> which a series of people stood up</font>

631
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:27,089
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mic and proceeded</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to throw under</font>

632
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:31,409
the bus basically in response to that

633
00:34:27,089 --> 00:34:33,029
I've tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to respond to I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

634
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:35,190
concern which was that there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

635
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:39,919
an assumption made here about the bold

636
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:42,359
text that was did not<font color="#CCCCCC"> go over well and</font>

637
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:46,529
the new text while being a bit longer

638
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:48,449
tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort of not make any specific</font>

639
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:49,800
requirement exactly how in plantations

640
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:52,379
need to behave and just give<font color="#E5E5E5"> one example</font>

641
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:56,280
of here's how someone might<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

642
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:57,630
handle the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of the complex problem</font>

643
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,050
about getting actually consent for

644
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:03,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">network enumeration so all night I won't</font>

645
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:06,000
read this out loud I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> let you also</font>

646
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:07,500
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that this strikes</font>

647
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,869
a better balance of just sort of

648
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:19,530
explaining what the problem is and how

649
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:21,180
one might want to address it but that is

650
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:23,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only slide here that was the most</font>

651
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,810
contentious<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic you know from the last</font>

652
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:27,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">time we talked about it I hope this new</font>

653
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:30,930
text will sort of satisfy the concerns

654
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:32,670
that were brought to the mic if this

655
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:37,560
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it would be great to get some</font>

656
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:38,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">feedback on that there is so this</font>

657
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,869
document is pretty close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ready</font>

658
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,119
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a last call there's still some</font>

659
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:45,839
mechanical stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to do to include</font>

660
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:49,369
the appropriate RFC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2119 language but</font>

661
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,369
this was like the biggest open issue

662
00:35:56,849 --> 00:36:00,660
so can I ask the folks who had

663
00:35:58,799 --> 00:36:02,700
previously had concerns about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this if</font>

664
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're satisfied</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

665
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:07,200
Wendy and he could you you were both

666
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:09,029
people who'd had concerns that take a

667
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:15,419
moment to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read it and let us know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

668
00:36:09,029 --> 00:36:17,640
you think culinary I I'll say I I will

669
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,749
be what I've said with no ask for the

670
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,509
working group to change anything but I

671
00:36:18,749 --> 00:36:23,999
mean I I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always had viewed the beginning</font>

672
00:36:21,509 --> 00:36:26,210
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use a camera implied granting</font>

673
00:36:23,999 --> 00:36:28,558
access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my network as sort of like</font>

674
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:31,880
hysterically bad but I don't have a

675
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:34,680
better suggestion and I like Duke and I

676
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,779
I can live with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know i</font>

677
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't i don't agree with it but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

678
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:47,519
I've said<font color="#E5E5E5"> my piece before and it's been</font>

679
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:55,589
heard and I'm done stocking the

680
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:59,279
microphone this is DK j<font color="#CCCCCC"> @ similar to</font>

681
00:36:55,589 --> 00:37:00,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">Colin I you know network location is an</font>

682
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:03,239
entirely different thing from access to

683
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:07,109
the camera conflating the two seems very

684
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:09,660
weird to me I agree most strongly in

685
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:11,249
this text here about the underlying

686
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,749
issue is complex and difficult to

687
00:37:11,249 --> 00:37:15,899
explain making explicit consent for

688
00:37:12,749 --> 00:37:18,439
enumeration troublesome so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

689
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,440
any fixes

690
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:29,190
the guidance<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see is if</font>

691
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:37,560
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> could think through an experiment</font>

692
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:39,630
with some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attempt to use public</font>

693
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,040
network addresses and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> gradually</font>

694
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:44,220
fall back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to things that might be more</font>

695
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,020
sensitive but I realized that's going to

696
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,480
be worse performance initially which is

697
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:50,130
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what people want to see so</font>

698
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,740
I don't I don't know how to recommend a

699
00:37:50,130 --> 00:38:02,640
fix for this unfortunately but it's it's

700
00:37:52,740 --> 00:38:04,589
I'm still not happy yeah when Wendy

701
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,440
seltzer and I think similarly I

702
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:10,200
appreciate the steps the text has taken

703
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,750
from where it previously sort of implied

704
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:17,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network location was just a function</font>

705
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:23,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the camera and other media access and</font>

706
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:27,000
and I I too would would like to see a

707
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:31,770
user agents offering some different

708
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:35,690
controls and giving us users at and a

709
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:43,100

710
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:46,110
measures but don't have good suggestions

711
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:47,790
it's already<font color="#CCCCCC"> a clarifying question right</font>

712
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:49,320
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the new text it says gathering</font>

713
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,820
all possible candidates should only be

714
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,460
performed on some form of user consent

715
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,460
has been provided what are the

716
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:58,350
conditions in which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think if that</font>

717
00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:04,920
that makes that should<font color="#CCCCCC"> a show de not a</font>

718
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:08,990
must I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> afraid it's frozen let me ask</font>

719
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:11,550
her review my notes on this let's see

720
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:14,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah this was my point earlier</font>

721
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:18,060
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to update the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2119 language</font>

722
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:24,300
in here and this couldn't in fact be a

723
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:25,799
must I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would actually</font>

724
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,840
probably appropriate in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

725
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,800
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> too hung up on like that protect</font>

726
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:34,950
my word<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so in that case you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

727
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,810
you would not do the possible candidate

728
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:38,788
gathering until some form of user

729
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:40,919
consent has been provided the

730
00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:43,469
problem is exactly what the form of user

731
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:46,319
consent to provide when we don't have

732
00:39:43,469 --> 00:39:48,900
like a great model in our minds for hi

733
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:51,269
would you like to understand and deep

734
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,979
detail just how user sensitive the

735
00:39:51,269 --> 00:39:55,140
various locations that you might be

736
00:39:52,979 --> 00:40:00,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">revealing given different IP addresses</font>

737
00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:02,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">to a user so i guess that let's go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

738
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:04,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the line since</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm wandering off of</font>

739
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:05,308
clarification there<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever scroll up so it</font>

740
00:40:04,289 --> 00:40:07,259
seems like they're actually two

741
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:09,359
questions here what should be the

742
00:40:07,259 --> 00:40:11,279
behavior which we dictate the browser do

743
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,779
and the second is what should be the

744
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:15,289
slit or eat expert surrounds it that

745
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:17,849
explains why we mean it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> afraid and</font>

746
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:19,709
frankly I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought we had agreement yet</font>

747
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:22,019
the behavior and both these texts

748
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:24,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">describe exactly the same in exactly the</font>

749
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:25,529
same behavior and so Franco I thought we

750
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:29,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">had agreement that this was the behavior</font>

751
00:40:25,529 --> 00:40:31,890
on and um and we were only debating what

752
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:33,630
how we ought to rationalize it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

753
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:34,679
find<font color="#CCCCCC"> its prime time on that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'm</font>

754
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually disappointed see us real</font>

755
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:39,989
litigating yet again what the behavior

756
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:41,130
would have been on so um I believe we

757
00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:42,269
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> contested on this I'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to change</font>

758
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:51,599
the rule discussion of what the behavior

759
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:53,879
ought to be otoscope<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tobacker to III</font>

760
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,439
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had lost this I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not trying</font>

761
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,249
to re-litigate it I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was in the</font>

762
00:40:55,439 --> 00:41:01,678
rough<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I am okay being in the rough</font>

763
00:40:58,249 --> 00:41:03,029
cut rd with my chair hat on I don't

764
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:04,829
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this discussion is</font>

765
00:41:03,029 --> 00:41:06,749
necessarily relitigate but it is

766
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:10,079
important that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the language</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually be</font>

767
00:41:06,749 --> 00:41:12,959
clear to any application were vendor on

768
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:16,289
what this actually means and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

769
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:19,439
this work that says hey you've got to

770
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:21,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">get some form of consent actually is a</font>

771
00:41:19,439 --> 00:41:24,118
change from it is specifically to get

772
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:26,099
user media consent you must get right

773
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:27,869
because it is now opening up the

774
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:29,819
possible possibility that you might have

775
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:31,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">a different form of consent that you are</font>

776
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:35,249
using instead for example data channel

777
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:38,429
concept right so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we've we we</font>

778
00:41:35,249 --> 00:41:40,259
have to look at this as kind of a whole

779
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:41,969
package we can't go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say okay</font>

780
00:41:40,259 --> 00:41:44,609
we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does this reflect the</font>

781
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:46,559
idea because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really these the</font>

782
00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:48,630
details are here what are important we

783
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:50,489
all agree we want consent the question

784
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:52,180
is given that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have a specific</font>

785
00:41:50,489 --> 00:41:56,890
consent for

786
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:58,149
IP location what can stand in<font color="#E5E5E5"> or yes and</font>

787
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:01,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">I thought we had consensus that gage</font>

788
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:03,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">immediate qualified in the area well I</font>

789
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:06,040
mean the actual feedback project idiot I

790
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:08,079
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a little did not agree with that</font>

791
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:11,380
and they thought I'd you know should<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

792
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a Norman of non-payment hear about</font>

793
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:16,750
that gal media they must feel about that

794
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:18,490
you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is handled I rather say</font>

795
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:21,510
that you know we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> some form of man</font>

796
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:27,700
and then give getusermedia as one

797
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:29,349
non-normative example sure as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said I</font>

798
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:33,669
think sufficient was the text I'm being

799
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:37,319
treated it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on but okay I guess it okay</font>

800
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:37,319
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we can waste another to our</font>

801
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:48,400
Alisa Cooper um so not relocating the

802
00:42:46,089 --> 00:42:50,380
actual recommendation I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just trying to</font>

803
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm just thinking about when this goes</font>

804
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:57,220
through IHG evaluation and what's going

805
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:59,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">to happen and I think the way that the</font>

806
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:03,939
text is phrased about getusermedia

807
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:09,400
consent might benefit from a small

808
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:11,049
adjustment that instead of being<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font>

809
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,839
in some ridiculous instead of being in

810
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:17,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">the passive voice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> explain it as like</font>

811
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:19,930
this is how the user agent might justify

812
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:21,460
such a choice because it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

813
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,680
sort of it's sort of subtly making an

814
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:26,920
argument for<font color="#E5E5E5"> why that's a good choice</font>

815
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:28,210
the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read this which is kind</font>

816
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,980
of weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the actual</font>

817
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:31,660
recommendation is we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

818
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,460
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this but then it's</font>

819
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:35,558
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it says here's a way that it could</font>

820
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:38,200
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and here's why that that way is</font>

821
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:39,640
good whereas there's going to be a bunch

822
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,379
of debate about whether that way is good

823
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,540
or not and that's why it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

824
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:44,890
being normatively recommended and so it

825
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:48,880
would be better or to sort of project

826
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:51,279
onto the browser and say this is why 11

827
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,319
might justify it or this is how one

828
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:58,270
might justify it and not this is how we

829
00:43:53,319 --> 00:44:01,058
are justifying it do you think you can

830
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:04,869
write some text that would perhaps you

831
00:44:01,059 --> 00:44:05,950
know that you perform that rewording i'm

832
00:44:04,869 --> 00:44:12,880
missing love

833
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:15,368
that nuance yeah uh<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like to a</font>

834
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:20,740
slightly different point first<font color="#CCCCCC"> welcoming</font>

835
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:23,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">up the side that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answers may attempt</font>

836
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:25,419
to that but so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you say gathering</font>

837
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:28,328
should only be done once can you have

838
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:29,829
consent I would argue that act the

839
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:31,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">actual important thing is that the</font>

840
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:34,270
results of gatherings will be presented

841
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:35,470
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the API if you you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

842
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:37,509
browser think I'll get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very high</font>

843
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:39,549
probability there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be consent i'm</font>

844
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:41,740
going to start pinging this turn server

845
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:44,050
so that once the user clicks<font color="#E5E5E5"> on consent</font>

846
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:50,290
it's ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there would be</font>

847
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:51,339
a problem with that because the term

848
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:52,900
server is one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you do</font>

849
00:44:51,339 --> 00:44:55,720
without consent so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually the</font>

850
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">other interfaces i think but people want</font>

851
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:02,109
to disagree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with me that sounds good</font>

852
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:03,460
idea so not in<font color="#CCCCCC"> thompson i think the</font>

853
00:45:02,109 --> 00:45:07,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">coach is going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address that point I</font>

854
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:09,430
was getting up to offer some suggestions

855
00:45:07,089 --> 00:45:11,470
from my long and hard experience with

856
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:12,730
dealing with permissions and consent and

857
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:13,899
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then they'll be</font>

858
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:16,329
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> C side of things there's been a</font>

859
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,910
lot of discussions there it's quite

860
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:20,560
clear that different browsers have

861
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:23,020
different attitudes towards the way that

862
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,520
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask for consent and the way that</font>

863
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:28,900
they consider signals from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user in</font>

864
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:31,839
particular ways and this text I think

865
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:37,210
with the friendly amendments that alyssa

866
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:39,279
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about goes some way to to</font>

867
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:40,869
addressing that the first sentence the

868
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:46,119
rest of it particularly that second

869
00:45:40,869 --> 00:45:48,640
sentence a problematic but the key here

870
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:51,819
is that we I think we yeah we must<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

871
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:54,098
a must on that first sentence and that

872
00:45:51,819 --> 00:45:55,390
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the browser making a</font>

873
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:58,990
decision about whether that consent

874
00:45:55,390 --> 00:46:01,240
exists now to Jonathan's point you need

875
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:04,540
consent before you start releasing those

876
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:06,339
IP addresses into the wild and sending

877
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:07,450
messages to turn service is doing that

878
00:46:06,339 --> 00:46:12,339
since the<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a came from the</font>

879
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:13,660
application in the first place there's

880
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:15,069
there's multiple partners that you may

881
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:17,109
not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leak your IP address</font>

882
00:46:15,069 --> 00:46:18,400
information to one of them is the

883
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:19,360
potential communicant that you're

884
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,790
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

885
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:24,190
one is the turn server right you haven't

886
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:26,620
you have a list of local IP addresses

887
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:28,390
that you shouldn't just randomly publish

888
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:31,299
to arbitrary websites that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask for them</font>

889
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:35,339
so please please do not release his

890
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:37,990
information without user consent so yeah

891
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:43,020
sorry this is daniel con<font color="#E5E5E5"> gilmore from</font>

892
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:46,410
aclu this is that her tea from the floor

893
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:49,060
haha quick which I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> means I</font>

894
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:53,500
currently work for the floor right I'll

do my<font color="#CCCCCC"> best buy you floor I I wanted to</font>

896
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:58,410
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem that we may run</font>

897
00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:01,480
into if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not dealing with a browser</font>

898
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:05,440
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody's using WebRTC from a mobile</font>

899
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:11,520
app for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example my concern is that we</font>

900
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:13,540
don't want either the the app or the

901
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,060
downloaded JavaScript application on a

902
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:18,430
browser to ever be taken as the simple

903
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:22,440
act of downloading it is consent for

904
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:28,120
sharing this right oh no um and I can

905
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:29,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I think that you know come up as a</font>

906
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:32,230
sort of mentioned in the first sentence

907
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:34,240
there I the key piece here which is kind

908
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:36,010
of implied by the surrounding text and

909
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,649
isn't right present here on the slide is

910
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:41,860
that the drive by enumeration is very

911
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:45,970
specific to the web case and that's

912
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:47,500
actually you know the drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> I has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

913
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:48,609
consent if you just go to a web page you

914
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,740
shouldn't have all your addresses

915
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:53,920
enumerated but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually go and</font>

916
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:56,470
install an app that's something where

917
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,630
the app you know you can sent it to

918
00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:03,700
installing the app and that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

919
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:05,860
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a different case so if somebody</font>

920
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:09,009
sends me in invites to play poker<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

921
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:12,340
them on pokerstars our appt example from

922
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:15,010
long ago does it automatically send my

923
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:16,960
thing before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i accept or do i need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

924
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:19,270
accept the<font color="#E5E5E5"> invite as a form of user</font>

925
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,890
consent well that's getting to one of

926
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:23,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">our other requirements which is that if</font>

927
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:25,600
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> invited</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to join a call you</font>

928
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:27,960
should only<font color="#E5E5E5"> use relayed addresses that</font>

929
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:31,810
don't give up any location information

930
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:34,270
until you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually accept</font>

931
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:35,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you if you use that as</font>

932
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:38,890
the parallel<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm perfectly happy because</font>

933
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:40,720
I agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that in that case the</font>

934
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:43,240
relay addresses is probably not

935
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:46,000
sensitive in the same way but the fact

936
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:49,330
that somebody tries to get me to join a

937
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,060
particular app community or call in the

938
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:53,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">pokerstars</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense shouldn't send the data</font>

939
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:55,420
about where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am to that person correct</font>

940
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,890
that's that's all i'm getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> at it if</font>

941
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:59,860
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to make it</font>

942
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:01,299
under that requirement I'm hat okay

943
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:07,240
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna want us to down because</font>

944
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:11,980
i have no idea we talked about like<font color="#CCCCCC"> mike</font>

945
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:13,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">i don't understand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what rule you think</font>

946
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:16,420
you're applying to applications

947
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:18,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">downloadable applications okay so</font>

948
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:21,280
somebody has a downloadable application

949
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:24,100
that engage engages in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> casual game</font>

950
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,080
that casual game has identities

951
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,700
associated with it let's say my ex-wife

952
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,720
is one of the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> plays this game</font>

953
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:31,839
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we used to play all the time</font>

954
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:34,299
together<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get an invite from my ex-wife</font>

955
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:37,210
to play this<font color="#CCCCCC"> gavel game I don't want to</font>

956
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:39,550
send my IP address to my ex-wife until I

957
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:43,090
have said yes I accept we will play the

958
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:45,850
schedule came together I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> willing to</font>

959
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:47,920
send the relay address but my actual

960
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:49,240
current IP know that does my ex-wife

961
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,070
whether i'm home or at the office or

962
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:55,299
other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that simply add a scope</font>

963
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:59,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">Fritzl</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't understand how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's out</font>

964
00:49:55,300 --> 00:50:02,140
of scope for this work injury I'm think

965
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,150
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> dragging a thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was downloaded</font>

966
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:06,700
on your computer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a browser I'm</font>

967
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:08,560
saying if<font color="#CCCCCC"> download under</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my phone not</font>

968
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,000
i'm thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mobile app case and I'm</font>

969
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:12,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking in particular of casual games</font>

970
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,480
where you have peer to peer interactions

971
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:17,770
that might use WebRTC those are not what

972
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">would end poison the scope of the kind</font>

973
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:23,970
of stuff kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing we're talking</font>

974
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:26,440
about here they're not J sub n points

975
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:29,040
they're not program program will decided

976
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">we oughta scope</font>

977
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:52,550
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wave the Peter Thatcher I was</font>

978
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:55,700
just going to ask about Martin's comment

979
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:57,349
that they should must be a must if it is

980
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:59,680
a must then this phrase is basically

981
00:50:57,349 --> 00:51:03,010
saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you must not gather all</font>

982
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:06,980
possible candidates but that could be

983
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:09,650
achieved just by not gathering one

984
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:18,380
candidate right so it's not a very

985
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:21,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">strong list</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so so to Peter's</font>

986
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:24,859
comment then<font color="#CCCCCC"> fixed the sentence we have</font>

987
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:26,240
some rules along the lines of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the which</font>

00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:31,368
which part of things actually state in

00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:36,230
this sentence which ones are safe

991
00:51:31,369 --> 00:51:40,280
together in the absence of consent of

00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:43,190
any form write that down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we</font>

993
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:47,900
move on I got up to point<font color="#E5E5E5"> out something</font>

00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:50,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I needed to say in the earlier</font>

00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:54,050
statement was one of the concerns that

996
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:55,669
comes with this this choice of design

997
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:57,099
this choice of<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not actually</font>

998
00:51:55,670 --> 00:52:00,230
going to tell you what conditions

999
00:51:57,099 --> 00:52:02,869
consent come with is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have</font>

1000
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:04,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">any determinism in in your API just</font>

1001
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:06,859
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> that very clear that people</font>

1002
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:09,109
writing applications to the api's will

1003
00:52:06,859 --> 00:52:10,520
now have less certainty about what it is

1004
00:52:09,109 --> 00:52:12,410
that they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect from an</font>

1005
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:16,820
implementation that provides this API

1006
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:18,049
with respect to what IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses and IP</font>

1007
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:20,420
addresses they're going to get under

1008
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:23,150
certain conditions so if we explicitly

1009
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:24,320
said getusermedia are sufficient and you

1010
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:26,900
release all the IP addresses on

1011
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:29,450
getusermedia then you would know that

1012
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:31,010
you call getusermedia get consent for

1013
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:33,049
that and then you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all the IP</font>

1014
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:34,460
addresses but we're saying here is the

1015
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:40,339
browser decides what signals are

1016
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:42,020
necessary and that maybe signals of all

1017
00:52:40,339 --> 00:52:43,070
sorts it may be that the user has to

1018
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:46,609
move this their<font color="#E5E5E5"> mouse in</font>

1019
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:47,569
counterclockwise three times<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to get</font>

1020
00:52:46,609 --> 00:52:52,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">permission to use</font>

1021
00:52:47,569 --> 00:52:54,259
these IP addresses right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll point</font>

1022
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:55,910
out I point this weakness out and then

1023
00:52:54,259 --> 00:52:58,249
I'll also point out there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> consensus</font>

1024
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:59,899
in the w3c at least to the extent that i

1025
00:52:58,249 --> 00:53:01,368
can determine an employee there's any

1026
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:05,479
chairs engulfed in this process over

1027
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:08,959
there that this is okay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all forms of</font>

1028
00:53:05,479 --> 00:53:14,930
permission on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> browsers so just</font>

1029
00:53:08,959 --> 00:53:17,808
letting that information local 80 so non

1030
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:20,299
determinism in terms of what it means to

1031
00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:24,440
get a permission is entirely acceptable

1032
00:53:20,299 --> 00:53:27,589
for all forms of permission so non

1033
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:30,589
determinism is embraced wholeheartedly

1034
00:53:27,589 --> 00:53:35,599
yes especially from the permissions is

1035
00:53:30,589 --> 00:53:39,069
my prayer oh yeah yeah non determinism

1036
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:41,089
is actually really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> for solving hard</font>

1037
00:53:39,069 --> 00:53:44,269
political problems in the standards

1038
00:53:41,089 --> 00:53:45,859
process basically well yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

1039
00:53:44,269 --> 00:53:50,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you how is that different</font>

1040
00:53:45,859 --> 00:53:52,190
from the camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I just wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1041
00:53:50,449 --> 00:53:54,440
make sure so you're just you're just

1042
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:56,299
stating a fact about all of the

1043
00:53:54,440 --> 00:54:01,729
permissions that are associated<font color="#CCCCCC"> gear not</font>

1044
00:53:56,299 --> 00:54:05,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">just this one so there is something</font>

1045
00:54:01,729 --> 00:54:06,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">different in this case we have what we</font>

1046
00:54:05,089 --> 00:54:10,759
what i would call established social

1047
00:54:06,739 --> 00:54:13,249
norms around the requirements to give

1048
00:54:10,759 --> 00:54:16,459
consent for a camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has been well</font>

1049
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:19,759
established we have plenty of examples

1050
00:54:16,459 --> 00:54:20,629
in the sort of implementations that are

1051
00:54:19,759 --> 00:54:24,199
out there and there's basically

1052
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:26,589
established expectations that's less the

1053
00:54:24,199 --> 00:54:26,589
case here

1054
00:54:31,819 --> 00:54:42,000
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> TK j so prompted by the rules</font>

1055
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:43,589
lawyering I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about whether this</font>

1056
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,990
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong must or not if we turn it</font>

1057
00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:48,900
into a must it's also not a strong must

1058
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:51,149
because of the some form of user consent

1059
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:54,300
as is similar to sort of what what

1060
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:56,940
bargain was saying but<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe worse if a</font>

1061
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:59,730
user consents to say allow pop up

1062
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:01,950
windows from this website is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1063
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:05,339
form<font color="#E5E5E5"> of user consent we have to worry</font>

1064
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:06,960
about some implementer thinking that

1065
00:55:05,339 --> 00:55:10,970
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> pop-up windows are allowed we</font>

1066
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,970
can also do IP address enumeration I

1067
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:18,869
apologize to pol pol needs to speak so

1068
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:26,700
some of us lucky<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right on you oh it's</font>

1069
00:55:18,869 --> 00:55:36,869
what you healthy even picture showed up

1070
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:42,390
and I got the mic<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I do have the</font>

1071
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:45,089
booking a problem we can hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> you um I'm</font>

1072
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:47,879
missing something here is the way I read

1073
00:55:45,089 --> 00:55:50,339
this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way this works if</font>

1074
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:54,210
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a session that it only has data</font>

1075
00:55:50,339 --> 00:55:57,900
channels then you don't then you don't

1076
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:59,940
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> on host candidates unless or some</font>

1077
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:02,910
other frog that says please give me hers

1078
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:04,950
candidates that seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a man that's</font>

1079
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:08,129
the intended bang that seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a bad</font>

1080
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:09,149
deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will say to you what I said to</font>

1081
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:10,619
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will try to push the other</font>

1082
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:16,200
direction that we already<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreed on this</font>

1083
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:20,010
um yeah I know of some applications and

1084
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:22,078
production that do this with the they

1085
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:24,599
only use data channels and make it very

1086
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:26,609
well I mean they can end up being

1087
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:29,099
co-located between the two ends and

1088
00:56:26,609 --> 00:56:32,279
therefore really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

1089
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:33,480
local candidates right and so the

1090
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,710
browser won't give you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pop up this</font>

1091
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:37,770
edge would you like to give us host

1092
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:40,049
candidates well I know right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now they</font>

1093
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:43,130
don't because they don't have any need

1094
00:56:40,049 --> 00:56:43,130
for for media

1095
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:48,210
right right now we don't do it right so

1096
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:50,779
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the browser behavior is to</font>

1097
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:53,460
give out house candidates if you don't

1098
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:54,840
at the moment right so we're talking at

1099
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:56,880
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is we're talking about</font>

1100
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,350
removing that behavior and replacing it

1101
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,550
with one where we only give a<font color="#E5E5E5"> house</font>

1102
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:01,080
candidacy either you had a camera

1103
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:02,550
microphone or there were some pop

1104
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes yeah and specify any</font>

1105
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:07,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">comprehensible pop up which you've asked</font>

1106
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:09,450
you to consent to I mean you could

1107
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:11,669
invent some other kind of consent that

1108
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:13,140
can be used instead of using media in

1109
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:16,350
the case when there aren't any media

1110
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:18,359
that would probably work but it would be

1111
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:23,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty in the way just application I</font>

1112
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:27,210
must say but ok but yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

1113
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:29,760
for sourcing nursing requesting me when

1114
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:31,770
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't give the user to give</font>

1115
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,560
permission for media when there is a

1116
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:36,960
user interface has no use for media is

1117
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:47,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be even more confusing for the</font>

1118
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:49,530
user yes I agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so I really</font>

1119
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:57,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to be in Chicago debating</font>

1120
00:57:49,530 --> 00:58:04,530
this yet again um um you know I exactly

1121
00:57:57,030 --> 00:58:07,440
um I mean maten yeah I I guess this

1122
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:09,000
seems to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> this seems to be a not</font>

1123
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,110
particularly great outcome to a problem

1124
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,900
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't run pretty good solution for</font>

1125
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:14,970
and like and I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody's</font>

1126
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:17,100
arguing about the exact just offical

1127
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:18,600
retext because they're unhappy with the

1128
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:20,009
actual outcome and this is a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1129
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,339
expressing unhappiness even though we

1130
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:25,320
have no better actual solution so like

1131
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:27,300
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what does somebody have an actual</font>

1132
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:28,770
set of like rules that we wish to impose

1133
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,330
in the browser that are different than

1134
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:32,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rules we're currently proposed in</font>

1135
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:34,650
the browser on and that they think

1136
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:36,029
anybody's won't be then what<font color="#CCCCCC"> a greater</font>

1137
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:38,190
if you'll be happy about from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones</font>

1138
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:39,990
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently have or will be</font>

1139
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:41,970
happier about than this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if not</font>

1140
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:44,189
then I would actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> suggest that we</font>

1141
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:45,990
were shorting the text and basically

1142
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:48,480
stopped everything after the phrase the

1143
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:50,939
everything after getusermedia consent um

1144
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,350
and then at least we'll have less text

1145
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:54,150
argue about and with exactly the same

1146
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:56,578
rules

1147
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:58,260
so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> understanding is that we're going</font>

1148
00:58:56,579 --> 00:59:00,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get a PR from Alyssa if you'd like to</font>

1149
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:01,319
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a competing PR you're welcome to</font>

1150
00:59:00,089 --> 00:59:03,119
do so work the two of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like to</font>

1151
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:04,829
collaborate on a CRM of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy</font>

1152
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:07,440
about that as well but ultimately<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

1153
00:59:04,829 --> 00:59:09,690
going to have to have that the text and

1154
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,270
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the specific text because it's</font>

1155
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:14,010
pretty clear that when we try and

1156
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:17,339
discuss it from first principles we stay

1157
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:19,079
unhappy<font color="#CCCCCC"> dan burnout i agree i was</font>

1158
00:59:17,339 --> 00:59:22,380
actually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reiterate what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alyssa</font>

1159
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:24,690
said which is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically all we can</font>

1160
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:27,450
really do here is state that we require

1161
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:28,920
user consent we can maybe give different

1162
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:30,720
conditions under which we want different

1163
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:34,410
levels of user consent but for the most

1164
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:36,930
part we cannot say how that user consent

1165
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:38,220
is to be obtained I've always given the

1166
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:40,950
example that someone could actually

1167
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:42,899
download a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different browser where the</font>

1168
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:44,848
consent is given in the downloading and

1169
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,260
installation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that browser and that's</font>

1170
00:59:44,849 --> 00:59:51,089
been true<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the camera and microphone</font>

1171
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:53,190
access specifically by all this time if

1172
00:59:51,089 --> 00:59:55,710
you're blind and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you expect to use your</font>

1174
00:59:55,710 --> 01:00:00,299
may actually install a custom browser

1175
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:02,400
that always has your your microphone

1176
01:00:00,299 --> 01:00:04,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">live</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and that's always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

1177
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,579
acceptable<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the same thing is</font>

1178
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:09,960
true here the fact that we don't like it

1179
01:00:05,579 --> 01:00:11,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">as a kerr says is unfortunate but we</font>

1180
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,890
can't go beyond the requirement of

1181
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:21,899
getting user consent without saying how

1182
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:25,680
that needs to occur<font color="#CCCCCC"> and wendy seltzer</font>

1183
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:27,329
just acknowledging<font color="#CCCCCC"> martin's comment on</font>

1184
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,220
non determinism yes it's

1185
01:00:27,329 --> 01:00:32,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">non-deterministic because users have</font>

1186
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:35,819
different preferences and for some users

1187
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:37,559
that this data will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the IP data will</font>

1188
01:00:35,819 --> 01:00:40,079
be sensitive enough that they want to

1189
01:00:37,559 --> 01:00:41,760
get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a different set of</font>

1190
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:44,160
considerations and whether that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

1191
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,440
that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using extensions that give</font>

1192
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:49,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">them greater control or choosing</font>

1193
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:52,079
different browsers that that give them

1194
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:53,339
greater control they will have a

1195
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,190
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience and their</font>

1196
01:00:53,339 --> 01:00:59,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">experience of RTC may be worse but their</font>

1197
01:00:56,190 --> 01:01:02,970
experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> of privacy will better match</font>

1198
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:04,980
their preference yeah just specifically

1199
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:07,350
on that topic I know the brave browser

1200
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:11,700
has an anti fingerprinting mode

1201
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:14,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">went in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that mode I the actually is no</font>

1202
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:16,649
there's even with consent no local

1203
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:18,480
actresses are exposed and so like

1204
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:20,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already in some non determinism</font>

1205
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:23,580
depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> what browser you're running on</font>

1206
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:26,160
for how this actual gathering process a

1207
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:32,340
little complete I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font>

1208
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:36,390
really an issue so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are now at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

1209
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:38,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">of today's session are the folks from</font>

1210
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:41,279
the Copeland draft available at this

1211
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:44,700
moment to leap up quickly and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll try</font>

1212
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:53,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">and do a couple of seconds on on it go</font>

1213
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:57,299
ahead go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me a minute to</font>

1214
01:01:53,280 --> 01:02:02,520
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking I'll get it's like this</font>

1215
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:05,220
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft is about requirements related</font>

1216
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:08,610
to the authentication step of web RTC

1217
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:13,310
especially when they are IDPs involved

1218
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:18,150
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup of the communication</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font>

1219
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:21,720
the the authors of the draft have done

1220
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:24,780
some use cases of course a main input of

1221
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:28,589
this use cases for somebody serving it

1222
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:34,590
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> web RTC architectural security</font>

1223
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:37,380
draft which has sections about IDPs but

1224
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:40,470
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only also there are multi parties so</font>

1225
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:45,150
let's put the possibility to set up a

1226
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:47,640
call between different domains and for

1227
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:53,400
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> an example of use case inside</font>

1228
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:59,879
number three<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a an enterprise use case</font>

1229
01:02:53,400 --> 01:03:04,230
where the color party would like to hide

1230
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:07,410
his her identity when she is making

1231
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:10,410
performing multiple calls to of

1232
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:11,759
different be parties so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1233
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:14,779
can't see the slide numbers from here

1234
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:18,630
can you tell me when I'm undressed<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1235
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:20,170
so typically what they are afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1236
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:23,109
song some kind of

1237
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:27,549
i would say user concerns requirement as

1238
01:03:23,109 --> 01:03:34,029
they are afraid that their IP are<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1239
01:03:27,549 --> 01:03:37,059
a email identifier leaks within as the

1240
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:41,230
identity assertion when the identity

1241
01:03:37,059 --> 01:03:44,589
assertion<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's done another type of</font>

1242
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:48,160
concerns I have is at the be party which

1243
01:03:44,589 --> 01:03:50,859
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> called may want not to be called</font>

1244
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:57,450
again by the a party so that they would

1245
01:03:50,859 --> 01:04:01,270
like some kind of again privacy

1246
01:03:57,450 --> 01:04:04,509
regarding their identify us as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a correct</font>

1247
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:07,329
part and regarding the requirements i

1248
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:11,770
think also basically to sum up they want

1249
01:04:07,329 --> 01:04:14,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be able to configure and as a privacy</font>

1250
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:17,799
on a per core basis and also on a pair

1251
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:20,319
IDP basis so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example for the</font>

1252
01:04:17,799 --> 01:04:23,380
call center<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the next example in</font>

1253
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:26,109
this size<font color="#E5E5E5"> for is on the same about the</font>

1254
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:30,359
same vein so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically this is a summary</font>

1255
01:04:26,109 --> 01:04:30,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">of of this line</font>

1256
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:52,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not gain it's a lot it's finished</font>

1257
01:04:49,309 --> 01:04:55,549
basically I so they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that their</font>

1258
01:04:52,249 --> 01:04:57,098
requirements are important regarding the

1259
01:04:55,549 --> 01:05:00,799
point of view of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user and the</font>

1260
01:04:57,099 --> 01:05:07,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is is it interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1261
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:13,640
this is the ITF how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>
