just write notes most of the section

34
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,950
lady questions they didn't evolve a few

35
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:14,340
anyone else<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you can you as in</font>

00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:02,250
meeting this is the agenda now we are

46
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:08,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do a little more aggressive</font>

47
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:11,400
agenda bashing because um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I added two</font>

48
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:19,608
topics late in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> game and they are at</font>

49
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:21,510
the end of the session and so my ad um

50
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:24,888
we're to make sure we have time for

51
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">timing Oh yep</font>

52
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:35,490
my my ad<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted me to make sure to tell</font>

53
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:37,889
you that uh we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do a gender</font>

54
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,139
bashing does<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone mind if we add off</font>

55
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:44,909
state and ephemeral discussion at the

56
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:46,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">end and if the and timing operations if</font>

57
00:04:44,909 --> 00:05:01,590
there's any objections we'll use please

58
00:04:46,770 --> 00:05:05,729
speak up the apps uh I will the best way

59
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:08,580
Joel for you is to simply it's just an

60
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:11,219
idea that that tall has tall is going to

61
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,289
tell you right now Tommy's<font color="#CCCCCC"> rahi marvel</font>

62
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,360
this is a topic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like to</font>

63
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:17,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">raise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's something new so there is no</font>

64
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,250
draft about it right now but it's a new

65
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:29,580
topic so like to a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes to talk</font>

66
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:32,000
about sue is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it possible pardon I don't</font>

67
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,639
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did you present this before</font>

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so a a bit of background we going</font>

69
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,949
into the slot itself but there is an

70
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:45,509
experimental RFC which defines the time

71
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:49,020
capability in netcong and basically the

72
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:50,819
idea we want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about no no it's</font>

73
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:56,909
not different the idea here is to use

74
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:58,770
that capability here in I to RS<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I see</font>

75
00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:00,779
is it possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to front-load the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Upstate</font>

76
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,779
and foremost<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight discussion no</font>

77
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:06,539
according I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to move it because of</font>

78
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:11,550
the request for my ad and so I don't

79
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:14,159
have an option I don't I I know I would

80
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:19,740
unless all the working group feel sorry

81
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:21,509
welcome back them unless but<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I</font>

82
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,789
can do it this way folks does anybody

83
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:28,259
mind if we move the OP state discussion

84
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:30,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning ok we will then take</font>

85
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group and move the off state</font>

86
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:34,949
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning I need to do the chair</font>

87
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,779
slide we will then<font color="#CCCCCC"> do the OP state we</font>

88
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:37,129
will then do the filter<font color="#E5E5E5"> base driven the</font>

89
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:46,550
data

90
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:54,080
Center any other agenda bashing okay let

91
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:56,209
me go through with the chair stuff okay

92
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:02,659
this is simply a status i will try to do

93
00:06:56,209 --> 00:07:05,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">this within a few minutes so at the RC</font>

94
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:08,058
editors is the arduous protocol security

95
00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:10,849
document at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IHG</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably at its last</font>

96
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:13,189
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's been was the last holder and he</font>

97
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:15,639
says looks good<font color="#E5E5E5"> but he hasn't cleared</font>

98
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:17,779
yet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're about to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go to RFC</font>

99
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,059
publication with the ephemeral state in

100
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:24,439
the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of december we are going</font>

101
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:26,599
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isg with the draft yang l2</font>

102
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:29,689
topology we're waiting for revision on

103
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:32,119
both of those and then then was decided

104
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:35,929
to said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he would press that through</font>

105
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:38,509
quickly now how important is our

106
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:40,399
topology model kudos to the folks in

107
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:42,769
this working group that the topology

108
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,469
model has actually been the center of

109
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:51,050
many creative things and thanks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

110
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:52,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">pavan here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah or many of the t's folks</font>

111
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,569
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been very collaborative along with</font>

112
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:58,490
other people so we appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

113
00:07:56,569 --> 00:08:01,849
are waiting for implementation reports

114
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,649
at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my suggestion to the</font>

115
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:07,759
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group is we get a little bit</font>

116
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:11,629
more implementation details on the rib

117
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,809
and the filter based rib and maybe even

118
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:17,149
the topology model for l2 the reason is

119
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:21,409
we need to know how complex or non

120
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:23,389
complex these are now what is what have

121
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:26,179
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> wah and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alia agreed for the</font>

122
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:29,089
protocol work the protocol work should

123
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:31,489
go to thee for the ephemeral<font color="#CCCCCC"> state yang</font>

124
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:34,639
changes should go to net mod the

125
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:37,969
protocol were excuse me the yang data

126
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:41,930
modeling work for a femoral state should

127
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:44,720
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to net mod the protocol work for</font>

128
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:47,660
netcom forest gump should go to the net

129
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,740
conf working group if the ephemeral

130
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,740
state data store

131
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:59,509
is needing to be discussed it should be

132
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:02,899
discussed within those groups and we are

133
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:06,410
an incubator protocol a discussion we

134
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:08,720
will give help we will do the femoral

135
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:12,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">datastore</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discussions and then they will</font>

136
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,850
go back for final revision there now if

137
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,279
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work of course our friendly</font>

138
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:19,339
ad will help us figure out what to do

139
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:21,680
next but a multiple stream approach

140
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:23,689
usually works better including having

141
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,609
lots of hallway discussions that I just

142
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:29,079
had when I sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a draft this morning</font>

143
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:32,029

about filters to see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens and</font>

149

154
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:10,930
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> korean group picked up and took the</font>

156
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:19,579
implemented a simple filter based rib

00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:29,029
security devices it was a five month

160
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:32,569
project with a student<font color="#E5E5E5"> group based on</font>

162
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:38,000
added<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you see it they had a web</font>

163
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:40,040
interface it was up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the knowledge we</font>

164
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,379
learned is this data model stuff really

165
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,050
works i'm sure the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eng and then that</font>

166
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:50,209
confident mod groups are are saying yep

167
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:52,819
we knew but the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for us what we</font>

168
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:54,829
had to do for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye to NSF group to</font>

169
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,660
fit it within the student product is to

170
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:59,449
create a simple version of our filter

171
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,459
based rib we may want to think about

172
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:04,579
factoring things into simple and

173
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:07,638
complete and have a model in which

174
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:09,888
case it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be something to discuss</font>

175
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:12,470
but it's just a piece of reporting on

176
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:16,819
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping that each time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a</font>

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:19,489
report on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> feasibility now let me go</font>

178
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:21,439
on to the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> topic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aaliyah the working</font>

let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the off state and I'm going</font>

182
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:35,569
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the S do a mic talk so that they</font>

00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:39,859
can see us just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a minute do you just</font>

184
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:42,019
yeah the next one there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are very</font>

185
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,199
few slides in this one if you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> hit</font>

00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:58,610
the next one<font color="#CCCCCC"> conatus the projector it's</font>

187
00:11:45,199 --> 00:12:01,329
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit huh yeah if you can it</font>

188
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:06,439
would be nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> and big okay it's a little</font>

00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:08,809
fuzzy<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay life is good okay would you</font>

190
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:14,059
go back up i forgot something<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font>

191
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:15,799
I can do it I'm sorry just do you mind

192
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:23,689
maybe just increasing it and then just

193
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:26,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">moving up and down okay um I want to</font>

194
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:32,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">compliment the net mod group on their</font>

195
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:36,610
work in the datastore model for op state

196
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:39,350
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> created this model and</font>

everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not in this model and</font>

198
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,839
I will step out of this thing is the

199
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:52,368
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> there everything come else</font>

200
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:54,319
comes from their diagram little color

201
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:59,269
guys didn't think the dots work really

202
00:12:54,319 --> 00:13:03,799
well for me um<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh ho did someone find do</font>

203
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:05,749
something right oh wow I'm having<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun</font>

204
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:08,239
with your computers that's good have fun

205
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:11,480
enjoy anybody gets weird an email from

206
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:17,649
Sarah's computer don't yeah that's the

spam from Russ<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so um</font>

208
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:26,300
the blue is the in configuration portion

00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:36,740
in the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> op state model and draw a few</font>

212
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:39,020
ideas for I to RS and engage in some

213
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,900
discussion this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a formalization</font>

214
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:44,750
this is a discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hopefully will</font>

215
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:47,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">help you discuss further with on the</font>

216
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:56,870
mail list and discuss further with the

217
00:13:47,090 --> 00:14:00,860
net mod group if you have the confute is

218
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:05,660
the configuration portion of the model

219
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:10,190
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the purple with the applied and off</font>

state is the actual read-only portion of

221
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:15,770
the model that might be used by the

still part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> model is a control</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">done by a femoral state we might have to</font>

226
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:29,600
it is potentially possible in their

227
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:33,790
model to have one ephemeral state data

228
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:37,340
store or a second this is in their model

229
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:39,740
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a decision on what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

230
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:42,020
do I'm telling you what's possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:45,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">dynamic configuration protocols like</font>

233
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:52,220
I made it<font color="#CCCCCC"> air in it can't watch some</font>

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,500
small<font color="#CCCCCC"> type though under intended and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">says CEO I think supposed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be ro we'd</font>

only the<font color="#E5E5E5"> r RW RW under for intended yeah</font>

237
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:07,340
attended is read right thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

238
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:12,440
nevermind it's it's it's read right

239
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:16,720
under intended my bad thank you um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

240
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:19,460
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the concept would be that the IRS</font>

241
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,280
protocol would fill up<font color="#E5E5E5"> these data stores</font>

242
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:25,010
and then these data stores for control

243
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,500
plane would be merged with intended and

244
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:31,529
installed and the implied would actually

245
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:34,499
have the data remaining ok so if

246
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:37,680
have a box and the box has the intended

247
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:39,870
config and it decides it's going to

248
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,779
implement our to us it's like a box that

249
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:44,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">says okay I have my intended I have my</font>

250
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:48,389
our truest protocol creating my femoral

251
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:53,879
data store and now the box has to decide

252
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:58,230
how to put it together okay we might

253
00:15:53,879 --> 00:16:02,490
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> in in the architecture document we</font>

254
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:04,800
said we would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some operator knobs</font>

255
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:07,879
it might tell how we did compared

256
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,529
between local config and a femoral state

257
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:14,600
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is definitely room for knobs in</font>

258
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:17,279
this diagram we also said that any

259
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,439
conflicting rights for a single

260
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:24,649
ephemeral datastore we would one have

261
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:24,649
one pane of glass and the power and the

262
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:32,819
two rights to the same environment would

263
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:35,100
would use the policy system to decide

264
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:39,750
which right were one and the rest would

265
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:42,720
be given an event and I'm sure you've

266
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:45,870
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of that in the IR 2's work okay</font>

267
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,819
any questions on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this data model because</font>

268
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:50,279
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just wanted you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see it and think</font>

269
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:56,219
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because this may factor in our</font>

270
00:16:50,279 --> 00:17:02,100
decisions on the list okay go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

271
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:07,110
the implication<font color="#E5E5E5"> is twofold and again</font>

272
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:09,059
this is future work and not this is work

273
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:11,609
we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on and the second item</font>

274
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:13,709
the caching of iOS client data is

275
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:15,990
something that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about</font>

276
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:20,370
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things we decided with our</font>

277
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:22,260
first archer s protocol definition was

278
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:24,510
to go with a set of<font color="#CCCCCC"> features and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

279
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:28,230
features that are in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements</font>

280
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:30,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">say one day to store one pane of glass</font>

281
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:35,070
but many of you were patient as a

282
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:38,039
working group and asked about caching of

283
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:40,620
iOS client data Andy has always

284
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:43,169
maintained that it is really difficult

285
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,229
to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the data at someplace</font>

286
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:51,740
else and reinstall it

287
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:54,350
this multiple data stores may allow that

288
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,900
but we would have to sit down and have a

289
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:59,240
working group discussion on anything

290
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:02,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be into the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> generation</font>

291
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:06,140
of the protocol ok so this the second

292
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:08,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">topic is something I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am bringing up to</font>

293
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,000
you to think i will float on the mail

294
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:14,660
list discussions and we may have

295
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,960
interims if there is interest the first

296
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:20,840
one on configuration validation as you

297
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:24,380
notice in the diagram there is much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

298
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:26,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">onus put on the ire 2's protocol if you</font>

299
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:31,179
would go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> kindly to the previous</font>

300
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:34,570
slide where you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IRS data</font>

301
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:37,429
protocol setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the data stores</font>

302
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:39,678
we've had many discussions in the past

303
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:42,080
about right validation and how we're

304
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:46,040
going to do that in the actual data

305
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:49,129
store at this point the model says that

306
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,899
that really depends on r2s instead of

307
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:56,299
being a set of configuration rules

308
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:58,220
however we must do it on and have some

309
00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:01,970
understanding of what that means in yang

310
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:04,100
if you will go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back so we're in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

311
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:08,240
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worlds and the worst of all</font>

312
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:10,399
worlds the best of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> worlds is the net</font>

313
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,799
mod designers of op state have given us

314
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,799
what we asked for that we asked for

315
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,960
freedom to be able to set up the

316
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:20,270
validation and to set the implementation

317
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,660
we are the worst of all worlds now we

318
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:26,360
get to design validation so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

319
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:29,299
another topic I'm introducing these

320
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:31,520
topics because thanks to the good work

321
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:34,790
from that mod we now<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a new</font>

322
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,770
framework to begin discuss as Kent will

323
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:39,230
indicate this is still an individual

324
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:41,059
draft so we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let their</font>

325
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:43,340
discussions go a little farther<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

326
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:45,799
week but if it goes to adoption then

327
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:48,770
that's what we really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see start</font>

328
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:51,260
talking about now I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> finished the</font>

329
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:54,918
introduction I will go to the questions

330
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:56,780
next and just get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense of the room</font>

331
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:59,000
this is off the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of your head and</font>

332
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:01,490
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thinking</font>

333
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,920
and I will try since we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have a</font>

334
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:06,380
scribe I will try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to listen very well to</font>

335
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:14,330
the recording if I miss it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked your</font>

336
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:19,310
forbearance<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so please um should I'd</font>

337
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:21,290
like to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not to undo any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

338
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:25,070
stuff in version one but two talk about

339
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:26,840
a version<font color="#CCCCCC"> two go ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be damned</font>

340
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:29,000
Bogdanovich<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can so when you say</font>

341
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,929
support different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of validation</font>

342
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,670
what validations are you have in mind

343
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:37,280
again what people had asked when I

344
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:39,290
talked to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OTL developers they were</font>

345
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about a million routes and they</font>

346
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:43,370
said gee they would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

347
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:45,920
do offline validation and less

348
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:49,159
validation when they install it inside

349
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:51,470
of the ephemeral<font color="#E5E5E5"> state bottle okay then</font>

350
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,970
how will they do validation against the

351
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:56,030
hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i can tell you immediately</font>

352
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:57,500
what for<font color="#E5E5E5"> interfacing qos policies</font>

353
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:00,440
because those will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the most</font>

354
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:02,360
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones for the you know for</font>

355
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,880
the ephemeral if you want to do offline

356
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,919
validation I don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the details</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

357
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,470
them but i think my question is whether

358
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">we should open this discussion and if</font>

359
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:14,410
you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's useful then we should</font>

360
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">open the discussion for a second round</font>

361
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:21,800
if there would be some use cases that

362
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:23,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be presented and then yes but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

363
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,970
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what what would with</font>

364
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:28,490
you sky send it because some of the

365
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:30,050
validation you have to know in an online

366
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:33,140
model because it's hardware dependent

367
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:35,270
yes thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that is a very good input</font>

368
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:38,000
to the chair that I need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get use</font>

369
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:40,160
cases for that I will<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask anyone with</font>

370
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,220
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposal to provide use cases and</font>

371
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:46,910
examples is there anyone else would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

372
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:50,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">to give suggested this is a to the chair</font>

373
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:51,980
on looking at new topics because we've

374
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:54,320
completed the first round of

375
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:57,680
requirements for protocol one and I'm

376
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:04,580
reopening in this discussion some of

377
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:07,060
these topics<font color="#E5E5E5"> um this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dan did you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

378
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,060
something else

379
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:14,119
on the policy knobs to resolve multiple

380
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:16,789
data store view to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> applied</font>

381
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:18,709
configuration view so if I understood

382
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:21,889
correctly from your previous picture of

383
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:25,669
you know the multiple data stores so you

384
00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:27,229
have the control plane data store one

385
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:29,690
and two and those are the panes of glass

386
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:32,059
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know are being essentially one</font>

387
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:34,009
over the other that is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is what</font>

388
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:36,639
is being defined in the net mod model as

389
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:41,320
far as I understand am I correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> kemp</font>

390
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:43,988
that that the control plane they the

391
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,668
datastore and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dynamic configuration</font>

392
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:51,320
protocols and the intended would have to

393
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:55,779
be munched like maybe three panes of

394
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,779
glass to come out with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> final answer I</font>

395
00:22:56,019 --> 00:23:03,590
Joel I'm not saying what we're doing I'm

396
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:08,090
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying what's in the model so it</font>

397
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:09,980
seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're getting horses</font>

398
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:12,080
and carts backwards we have a set of

399
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,850
agreements on what we need we have a set

400
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,449
of requirements the nut mod guys and the

401
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,949
net cons guys are trying to address<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

402
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:21,559
before we run off and try to make more

403
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:23,779
things let's see how that<font color="#CCCCCC"> works let's</font>

404
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:25,850
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the real hard questions</font>

405
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:27,889
are when the nut modern that comes guys

406
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,139
actually try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do the work that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

407
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:32,320
want to do before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go and try to</font>

408
00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:35,689
complicate it by adding any more

409
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,939
configurations so Rama to slip slip

410
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:41,600
solve the problem we've got first so

411
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:44,899
your feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> your feedback</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Joel that I</font>

412
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,269
that I'm taking as a chair is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

413
00:23:44,899 --> 00:23:51,678
feel that these discussions should be

414
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:55,879
delayed until we have this data model

415
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:57,889
tied down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the first protocol out</font>

416
00:23:55,879 --> 00:24:00,799
with all implementations did I

417
00:23:57,889 --> 00:24:02,689
understand did I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am I restating you're</font>

418
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,908
just good ear I don't know if we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

419
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:07,519
wait until we actually have lots of

420
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:08,899
implementations but let's get make some

421
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,299
progress on spelling it out see if we

422
00:24:08,899 --> 00:24:12,379
can get some implementation and we hit

423
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:14,059
her dress<font color="#CCCCCC"> well we've already agreed</font>

424
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:16,969
before we start throwing the cards back

425
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:19,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">up in the air ok we have implementations</font>

426
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:24,419
and protocols going

427
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:27,360
Jill I understand the wisdom and getting

428
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:29,159
things working I just need a little more

429
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">detail would you prefer to give me</font>

430
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:36,630
detail at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mic or afterward because</font>

431
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,850
my issue is there is how we had this

432
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:41,460
discussion for over two years about

433
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:44,490
panes of glass and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> emerge all</font>

434
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:47,460
together into a you know single unified

435
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:49,320
view and how we will do it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

436
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,809
we will will we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just allow two</font>

437
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:55,350
unidirectional or x direction from from

438
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:56,970
both ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I see it here and in this</font>

439
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,590
picture couldn't figure it out so I want

440
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:03,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get some clarification on that that's</font>

441
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:05,129
all I guess we have the ephemeral

442
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,928
requirements draft which we've already

443
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:10,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">agreed which you said it's almost done</font>

444
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:12,870
it spells out an approach to all of

445
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:16,860
these things yes and it is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

446
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:21,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing that strikes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me is it is not the I</font>

447
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:24,860
Torres working groups remit to spell out

448
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:27,918
exactly how net modern that conf in yang

449
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:30,059
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> my rest can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forget</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> modified it I'm</font>

450
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">very sensitive in other wearing other</font>

451
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:34,080
hats to other<font color="#CCCCCC"> work group stepping on my</font>

452
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,658
toes I don't want us and so your person

453
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:41,149
your individual draft that I think is

454
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:43,409
motivating this is is is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific</font>

455
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:46,650
just to go beyond what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had agreed</font>

456
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:48,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do that um being what I</font>

457
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:51,330
wanted to do with let the working groups

458
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:54,689
do their job individual draft Joel just

459
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:57,030
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be clear because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

460
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:59,220
mixing my chair duties with my

461
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:01,710
individual contributor duties I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

462
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:04,730
be very<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear about my chair duties my</font>

463
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:08,390
chair duties were after the first

464
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:14,909
protocol instance was out to reassess

465
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:17,669
this presentation is to react individual

466
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:22,080
drafts troll our individual dress for

467
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:24,780
another working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I really I</font>

468
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,730
really am trying to separate them Joe so

469
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:30,600
please<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry what's another</font>

470
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:31,830
clarification on this picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the the</font>

471
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,179
individual draft that we have in that

472
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:36,000
mod right now

473
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:38,430
it's actually not okay but just to make

474
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,830
sure it's an individual draft and that's

475
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,540
not what I'm asking here no that's not

476
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:44,340
where I'm going with this yeah it has a

477
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:47,909
line that feeds into applied and says

478
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:49,770
control plane protocols mm-hmm um so

479
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:51,720
what is what I think intended there is

480
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:54,600
that that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be I to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rest for</font>

481
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,880
instance so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust is feeding it is a</font>

482
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">control plane protocol and is feeding</font>

483
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,290
into applied but within the I Torres

484
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,100
control play protocol there could be

485
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:06,260
multiple data streams with with whatever

486
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:09,689
mechanisms you want for resolving

487
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:12,000
between them or whatever right but all

488
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">that resolution happens to the side and</font>

489
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,230
then feeds it<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes correct as one thing</font>

490
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,300
into the opinion even in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> dressed</font>

491
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:21,810
all the resolution occurs to the site as

492
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:24,120
we agreed in protocol version<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 okay let</font>

493
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:26,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">me go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the questions Joel thank</font>

494
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:30,060
you for your feedback I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

495
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:32,250
sure if there's someone else and Joel I

496
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:35,100
think the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is what you were</font>

497
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:37,830
emphasized we need more implementation

498
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:41,310
input on current stuff before we go to

499
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:42,929
one and two and I I do now take that is

500
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:45,840
there anyone else that would like to

501
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:50,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide input it this time on the next</font>

502
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:53,939
steps<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will go on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

503
00:27:50,520 --> 00:28:01,560
presentation yawn are you here please

504
00:27:53,940 --> 00:28:05,010
you're on next thank you and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

505
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:07,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">our next work is to look at new data</font>

506
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,430
models

507
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:34,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">Young gets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ready I will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> run the slides</font>

508
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:37,220
for you yeah hello hello yes this is a

509
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:40,459
fabric based management<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the Sentinel</font>

510
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:44,690
network so before details of this work

511
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:47,960
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a non protocol topology thoughts</font>

512
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:51,380
on what I two iced part you can do also

513
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:54,320
this is an implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> application of</font>

514
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:57,730
the existing I twice to park models and

515
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,679
it is the idea of this work is

516
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:05,150
implemented in the in an open source

517
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:10,490
project so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has some codes for you to</font>

518
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:13,700
review so next thank you so why we come

519
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:16,940
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with these sorts why we will provide</font>

520
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:20,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fabric based management for the day</font>

521
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:23,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">Center networks so this on the screams</font>

522
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,090
there are three shots three points that

523
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:29,420
we sink eyes important so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

524
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:30,740
is faster users of its deployment so for

525
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dates in the network's there are</font>

526
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,550
many tenants and the itch tenants has

527
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:36,680
their requirements of new applications

528
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:39,379
and new services deployed on the

529
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:42,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">networks so in this case the center</font>

530
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:45,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">network should be dynamically be asked</font>

531
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:48,380
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide their service installation on</font>

532
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:51,370
the networks and the second one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is with</font>

533
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:55,670
the size of the data network increase

534
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:58,610
the devices and technology involved

535
00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:01,370
where we increase which also complex

536
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:03,260
complicated at work of the network

537
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:05,510
management and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service deployment</font>

538
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,870
and the third one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new</font>

539
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:10,910
technologies can be used so as we know

540
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:13,729
the MBO three are talking about the new

541
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:17,600
technologies for I for day<font color="#E5E5E5"> Center also</font>

542
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:20,480
we have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sfc to waiting to the</font>

543
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,480
protein the center network so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

544
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:27,090
new technologies should be also applied

545
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:29,910
in that they send a network very easily

546
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:33,740
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one is what we would like to</font>

547
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:37,020
do the motivation of their management so

548
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:40,620
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we put all the things you just one</font>

549
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:44,490
pocket or in one box it's a can be many

550
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:46,679
complex so in our concept we would like

551
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:51,090
to divide the whole network management

552
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:54,120
into three pieces each piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where we</font>

553
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:57,840
divided our pediat we added by the

554
00:30:54,120 --> 00:31:01,439
different type odd of administrators so

555
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:04,139
for the service layer is it is for the

556
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,050
user service representation it's only

557
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:10,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">cares about water users wants for the</font>

558
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:14,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">network and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taking too much</font>

559
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:16,140
knowledge about the real devices and the

560
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:19,409
rear topology of information while the

561
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:22,620
second one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the fabric topology layer</font>

562
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:26,100
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to manage it they'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> send</font>

563
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:28,649
the network fabric topologies and then

564
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:31,500
the button why is the physical topology

565
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:33,840
which cares about the real devices in

566
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:38,340
the network and how to deploy these

567
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:41,370
devices so the how to deal we start to

568
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:43,350
pour but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is we divide is the</font>

569
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:45,840
whole problem into three layers and the

570
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:49,949
each layers can be managed by different

571
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:54,750
administrators using by using the models

572
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:58,080
that we are defining this job so the

573
00:31:54,750 --> 00:32:00,330
objectives of this to draft is to the

574
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,780
first one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide a date the</font>

575
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:06,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">fabric body model to manage it fabrica</font>

576
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:09,510
topology and second why's the ferry

577
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:12,960
service to body model to represent what

578
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:17,690
kind of services for users they want

579
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:20,790
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the net day centre networks so next</font>

580
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:24,660
this is the layering architecture of

581
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:26,639
what we want to achieve in the internet

582
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,190
work so from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> button it's the</font>

583
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,990
physical layer we have devices in the

584
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:37,200
many pieces of devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's devices is a</font>

585
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:40,960
is notes and there are some there are

586
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,990
device motoring things at this layer

587
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,270
and the on the second layer is the

588
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:50,169
topology layer which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fabric to</font>

589
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:52,629
party layer in our scenario so for this

590
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:55,720
center network that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ordered a center</font>

591
00:32:52,630 --> 00:33:00,490
network is composed of several pots or

592
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:02,950
we can see several fabrics so each

593
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:06,580
fabrics can be considered as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a basic</font>

594
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:09,669
note for this net welcome so as this way

595
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:13,178
are we care about what is a fabric what

596
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:16,210
type what kind of technology the fabric

597
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:20,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">used and also the fabric inter</font>

598
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:23,380
connection so at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> a player which is</font>

599
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:25,419
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Soviets layer its provides a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> logical</font>

600
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:30,100
topology information for the users and

601
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:33,070
the lesson to<font color="#E5E5E5"> express how their networks</font>

602
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:35,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">are connected as we can see there are</font>

603
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:39,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">two end points on the screen end points</font>

604
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:43,418
can be considered as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> host used by the</font>

605
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:47,080
tenants the hosts is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where be user to</font>

606
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:49,179
connect these layers the endpoints were

607
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,789
provided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attachment in this</font>

608
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:54,789
architecture the first active attachment

609
00:33:51,789 --> 00:33:57,669
is at the physic light layer and the

610
00:33:54,789 --> 00:34:00,940
second Weiss at the logical layer so by

611
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:04,120
when the host sir is initiated for some

612
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:07,210
tenants right<font color="#E5E5E5"> were indicated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

613
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:11,500
positions in the architecture in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

614
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:14,050
whole system where know which<font color="#E5E5E5"> port which</font>

615
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:16,389
device and which partying the<font color="#CCCCCC"> underlay</font>

616
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:18,849
network is mapped to is bounded to the

617
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:23,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">fab reports in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> favorite layer and</font>

618
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:25,899
also bound to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the logical layer pots so</font>

619
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:30,750
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole process for the whole</font>

620
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:34,810
earrings structure of the work so next

621
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:37,389
so this is using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the architecture where</font>

622
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:40,270
we can use the fabric topology model and

623
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:42,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">also the service model so the there is a</font>

624
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:44,710
topology manager which provides the

625
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:47,560
topology information so as you can see

626
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:50,260
the fabric service module a model<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

627
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,210
not to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any idea about the topology</font>

628
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,090
information but only cares what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

629
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:59,060
connect

630
00:34:53,090 --> 00:35:04,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">shun between this our user endpoints so</font>

631
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:07,910
next yes this is a fabric service model

632
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:11,029
it combines it contains the two modules

633
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:14,660
the most important why is the fabric

634
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:18,080
service module it described a logical

635
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:21,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">network for users so there are the basic</font>

636
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:23,870
noting this module is the logical

637
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:27,920
routers logical switchers and there are

638
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:32,390
also some logical TPS which acted as a

639
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:35,410
logical pots to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> teepees are all</font>

640
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:37,670
have different roles some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them are</font>

641
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:40,100
represented<font color="#CCCCCC"> a layer 2 connection and</font>

642
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:41,870
some of them are presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> represents</font>

643
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:44,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the layers reconnection also there are</font>

644
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:50,750
connection to the endpoints so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

645
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:54,230
sister from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the logical</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network it can</font>

646
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:58,160
represent or just ratios connection

647
00:35:54,230 --> 00:36:06,520
between the endpoints what the user look

648
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:09,500
like their network is look like so next

649
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:12,500
so it's also provide some info<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

650
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:14,920
functions as in this module the most

651
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:18,350
important thing in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> module</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is I</font>

652
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:20,660
bound ideological ports to only pots so

653
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:24,440
it's the three layers can work together

654
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:27,890
to so I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say some configuration on</font>

655
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:31,960
the logical part can be mapped to the

656
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:38,390
physical layer pots at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical</font>

657
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:41,480
networks so next so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fabric</font>

658
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:44,180
topology model what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> fabric support</font>

659
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:47,630
you look like as we said the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day center</font>

660
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:51,049
network is composed of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> several pots</font>

661
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:54,020
or several fabrics so in this concept we

662
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:57,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">gesture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> consider each fabric as a basic</font>

663
00:36:54,020 --> 00:37:00,770
note so for the fabrics there are three

664
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:03,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">type of pots are we which we call the</font>

665
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:06,500
fabric pots this<font color="#E5E5E5"> part can be connection</font>

666
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:10,160
to the connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the endpoints and</font>

667
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:13,910
also this<font color="#E5E5E5"> two audits part can be</font>

668
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:19,940
connected to other fabrics or it can be

669
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:23,240
mapped to the underlay devices so this

670
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:29,270
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is the fabric top Oh Julia looks</font>

671
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:32,959
like so next yeah this is a yeah this is

672
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:35,390
implemented in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a open source project and</font>

673
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,570
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also released so you can find</font>

674
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:41,180
the detail of this project<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the link</font>

675
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:43,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> screen also there are some codes</font>

676
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:46,609
available at a key hub which can be

677
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:54,319
found at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have almond daylight</font>

678
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:57,200
fast project so so we just show some

679
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,690
comments resolution and debates since

680
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:03,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">last meeting so there are technical</font>

681
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:05,090
changes we added how to our configure

682
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,129
and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> represent a fabric</font>

683
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:10,850
interconnection into these current

684
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:12,830
models and also we use we have another

685
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:16,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">chapter which is the fabric service</font>

686
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:19,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">module modeled after to explain how to</font>

687
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:22,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">use this fabric model to deploy your</font>

688
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:25,160
network in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really a concept we</font>

689
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,670
also provide the better extensibility of

690
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:32,710
this work so also we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

691
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:37,040
the new also to join our work so next

692
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:38,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">last one thank you um thank you very</font>

693
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:42,020
much on for the presentation do we have

694
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:45,890
any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the technical content</font>

695
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:47,660
of the presentation not not on where it

696
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,670
belongs in which working group but on

697
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:53,930
the technical content<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to break</font>

698
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:56,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the two apart these questions but i'm</font>

699
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:58,910
specifying the type of questions chef

700
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,440
please don't ask does it belong in<font color="#CCCCCC"> tease</font>

701
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:02,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">or someplace else we'll deal with that</font>

702
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,420
in the second set of questions this is

703
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:09,350
just clarification or questions about

704
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:12,080
the technology thank you do you plan to

705
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:13,790
describe complexity within the server so

706
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:16,250
relationship between your shellfish

707
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:19,009
we're sure router and point special and

708
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:19,880
point within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the host what you might</font>

709
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:22,609
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a how</font>

710
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,980
which has virtual switch which might

711
00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:26,900
have stopped<font color="#E5E5E5"> wilshire outer which might</font>

712
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:31,309
have built<font color="#CCCCCC"> your router which is in front</font>

713
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:34,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">of your shellfish yeah do you mean the</font>

714
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:37,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">end point can connect to their routers</font>

715
00:39:34,299 --> 00:39:39,680
always in same not right<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh yeah it's</font>

716
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:41,839
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are where be the switchers so</font>

717
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,288
the end point for point first attach

718
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:48,619
where go to the switchers in they sent

719
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:50,480
networks so sorry that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that's my</font>

720
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:52,339
question how how do you plan to

721
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,799
represent it within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the model which is</font>

722
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:57,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">the second question the notification</font>

723
00:39:54,799 --> 00:40:00,339
flow I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> very similar to work we are</font>

724
00:39:57,109 --> 00:40:02,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to do in TS in multi layer model</font>

725
00:40:00,339 --> 00:40:05,150
how do you provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> workflow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

726
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:08,299
notifications from lower level to higher

727
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:11,390
level and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> do i do create feedback</font>

728
00:40:08,299 --> 00:40:16,250
reactionless you mean the notification

729
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:20,839
from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> amalayer to that yeah yeah so</font>

730
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:23,839
Joe do medical pack which just which one

731
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:26,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> architecture one yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

732
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:29,058
the end point where provided two points

733
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:31,279
to attach points from the device at the

734
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:34,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">physical layer and also another from the</font>

735
00:40:31,279 --> 00:40:39,519
logical layers so when the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end point</font>

736
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:42,920
is online so these three devices at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

737
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:44,808
three pots the one post at the logical

738
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,750
layer and ideas the second part<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

739
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:50,660
fabric layer and also the device layer

740
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:53,119
port where be bonded together so do you

741
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:58,460
envision daisy chain chain of

742
00:40:53,119 --> 00:41:00,829
notifications going bottom up you know

743
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:06,740

756

t stop OG drafts there is a the concept

757
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:51,620
of absurd note the absolute can

758
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:55,230
represent a topology exactly in my view

759
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:58,410
the layer blue and the blue and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

760
00:41:55,230 --> 00:42:02,720
layer gray that is represented here so

761
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:06,660
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is what is the difference</font>

762
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:10,140
yeah actually the layer 2 is for the the

763
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:13,290
day Center fabricate the pot it has some

764
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:16,529
pot specific things like which<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones the</font>

765
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:20,070
leaf which which note in inside the

766
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:22,950
fabric is null mr. leaf and whether this

767
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:28,050
is the center eyes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gateway part of</font>

768
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:31,919
fabric or the distributed gateways

769
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:35,370
fabric so it support a center network a

770
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,500
pod it might be not so directed to the

771
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:59,130
teeth yeah you didn't catch the

772
00:42:37,500 --> 00:43:03,260
difference hey thank you yeah I will you

773
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:08,370
I check that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> additional comments</font>

774
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:10,170
technical wise good<font color="#E5E5E5"> I encourage the</font>

775
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:13,109
people of make comments and<font color="#CCCCCC"> yanka top</font>

776
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:15,030
afterwards because that's one of the

777
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:17,010
reasons we go through models is to see

778
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:19,710
where your stoop locations where there's

779
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:21,510
not the real neat thing about data

780
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:24,660
models is hopefully that makes it a

781
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:26,610
little bit clearer<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next one which is feedback</font>

783
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:40,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">as Joel suggested on one of our existing</font>

784
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:40,520
models<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

785
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:47,800
this is some learning from the hackathon

786
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:51,670
as Joel suggested we need to work on

787
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:54,700
learning things from what we had so I'd

788
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:57,099
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through the the filter based</font>

789
00:43:54,700 --> 00:44:00,009
rib and some conclusions we have from

790
00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:02,170
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> i2 and SF demo just I've mentioned</font>

791
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:03,609
it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the beginning but I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

792
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:08,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feedback from the working group</font>

793
00:44:03,609 --> 00:44:10,900
could you go to the next one<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so I</font>

794
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:13,509
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went through all of this we</font>

795
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:16,930
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh what we actually</font>

796
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:19,510
implemented it was initially the IRS

797
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:22,328
filter based rib was linked to the ECA

798
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:25,119
policy the ECA policy came out of some

799
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:28,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the super work and match nicely with</font>

800
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:31,180
the capabilities of firewalls what we

801
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,000
found when we implemented was maybe we

802
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:35,859
should take a simple approach and it was

803
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,210
necessary to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to get a quick</font>

804
00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:42,069
scalable implementation out now um the

805
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,750
ones that we discussed on the list and

806
00:44:42,069 --> 00:44:45,640
presented were a bit more complex

807
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:50,490
because they mapped to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy</font>

808
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:55,118
routing that's what's in the packet ECA

809
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:57,009
event condition policy and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

810
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:59,950
a CLS because we were going to try some

811
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:02,260
implementation the real question is we

812
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:03,939
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put acl's in we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

813
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:11,530
also waiting for some of your draft to

814
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:13,900
sort of then yeah I know um I agree it's

815
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:15,700
now time to do something useful like add

816
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:23,619
to it you were still changing it last

817
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:26,379
last couple months so we made some

818
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:28,329
additions to the filter<font color="#E5E5E5"> based rib we</font>

819
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:31,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">added some events should we have added</font>

820
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:33,960
them should we put a CLS in the current

821
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:36,099
draft link it in where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have regular</font>

822
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,380
filters or should we put it in a

823
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:40,780
different one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am looking for some</font>

824
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:43,210
feedback yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> dan if you have some</font>

825
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:45,549
feedback on how you might extend it or

826
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:47,680
how you might work with policy routing I

827
00:45:45,549 --> 00:45:49,750
would be glad to take that this is

828
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,899
general<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level feedback that we</font>

829
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:53,560
learned as we implement I haven't read

830
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:56,530
the draft

831
00:45:53,560 --> 00:46:00,460
the you know among the events so i can

832
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:03,660
tell you that in general the filters the

833
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:06,970
ACL drops has been designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> just as they</font>

834
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:08,950
essentially match and action containers

835
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:11,500
that you are putting into a single

836
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:17,470
container and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you augmenting with</font>

837
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:19,450
the match and match in action statements

838
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:23,589
that are supported by that hardware

839
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:26,319
platform so that that's that's a portion

840
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:30,100
of this the events were just time of day

841
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:33,730
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we be provided examples how to</font>

842
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:36,549
augment the existing filters the

843
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:38,610
existing acl's for different scenarios

844
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:41,290
at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that sorry they're like</font>

845
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:44,170
they are there different versions of it

846
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:46,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">i agree and it's nicely documented look</font>

847
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:48,550
that's a really good documentation and

848
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:51,310
the acs the question is whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

849
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:53,380
should subsume them under the the more

850
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:56,320
complex packet or put them on a side

851
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:58,720
model<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just is its its model</font>

852
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,040
refactoring questions and if no one has

853
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,810
a strong thing we'll try some

854
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:04,600
implementation and see how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes I</font>

855
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:07,840
just was looking for any<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments on the</font>

856
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:10,660
refactoring right that right now it goes

857
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:14,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">filter-based</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ribs to the pack of dca to</font>

858
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:16,089
the actual match conditions right here's

859
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:19,990
a packet match here's a condition and

860
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:21,430
what to do it only<font color="#E5E5E5"> does direct matching</font>

861
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:24,669
because that's what's designed in the

862
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:27,520
packet eca and matches the policy

863
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:29,230
filters in many boxes if i put acl's

864
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,600
underneath it becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's</font>

865
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:34,540
an alternative mechanism because many

866
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:37,089
people do use ACLs in that fashion the

867
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:39,340
other option is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just put a sales at a</font>

868
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:41,740
different place if you don't if there's

869
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:46,450
no real strong somebody's implemented it

870
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:48,879
will leave it as is and try ACLs and

871
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:50,740
then update the model well we

872
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,380
implemented the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ACLS and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you found</font>

873
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:54,459
out you know some you know some

874
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:57,580
optimizations with it so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use</font>

875
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:59,470
case if you're saying I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

876
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:01,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">think from the implementation point of</font>

877
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:04,209
view and right now I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any I</font>

878
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:06,040
don't have any opinion at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment one</font>

879
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:07,390
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the other so the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> step is to</font>

880
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:10,359
really implement

881
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:12,098
iptables using this filter based thing

882
00:48:10,359 --> 00:48:15,009
and use it to do a full policy router

883
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:16,990
okay anyone else implemented some of

884
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:19,150
this that wants to give feedback these

885
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:20,618
are just each time I'm trying to say

886
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:24,160
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we've learned since the</font>

887
00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:26,440
last time by implementation this time we

888
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,049
tried I got someone to work on a

889
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:31,059
firewall next time we may be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

00:48:29,049 --> 00:48:33,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">a second implementation entre pology</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

891
00:48:31,059 --> 00:48:35,980
don't think we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> is anyone had any</font>

892
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:41,140
two implementations to work on the

893
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:43,000
topology datamodel right now all I know

894
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:45,819
is the OTL<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of anyone</font>

else<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have some people Fung said he</font>

896
00:48:45,819 --> 00:48:55,119
might work with another mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

902
00:49:12,609 --> 00:49:17,680
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a new idea this was</font>

903
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:19,559
discussed in the past but it is

904
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,808
discussed for the first time in this

905
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:25,150
working group and it's mainly important

906
00:49:22,809 --> 00:49:26,829
for me to get feedbacks and to see if

907
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:31,240
there is any motivation to keep this

908
00:49:26,829 --> 00:49:34,539
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> going next please so we'll start</font>

909
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:38,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a simple example let's say we have</font>

910
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:43,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">this network and we want to update the</font>

911
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:50,348
ribs of r1 and r2 to the new paths which

912
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:52,808
are denoted by after next fleet and to

913
00:49:50,349 --> 00:49:57,490
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can do to route update</font>

914
00:49:52,809 --> 00:49:59,230
operations and since they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

915
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:01,538
necessarily performed at the same time

916
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:04,930
we may have some temporary congestion

917
00:50:01,539 --> 00:50:10,440
either on the top left link or on the

918
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:13,319
top right link next<font color="#E5E5E5"> please ok so if</font>

919
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:16,950
we could update both routers at the same

920
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:19,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">time we could avoid this congestion okay</font>

921
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:23,250
so that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> example let's see the next</font>

922
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:26,730
slide so we have a second example again

923
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:29,790
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to switch from the before to the</font>

924
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:33,980
after state and we have three routers we

925
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:36,800
need to update r1 r2 and r3 next please

926
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:40,170
so we want to perform a set of

927
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:45,359
operations not necessarily at the same

928
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:47,460
time in this example next please for

929
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:49,470
example we could perform the three

930
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:53,190
operations at three different update

931
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:58,020
times t1 t2 t3 so that t3 is greater

932
00:50:53,190 --> 00:51:01,050
than t2 which is greater than t1 and if

933
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:05,759
we could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that maybe it would help us</font>

934
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:09,470
out next<font color="#E5E5E5"> please so what are we proposing</font>

935
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:14,390
here so first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all earlier this year</font>

936
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:17,578
RFC 7758 was published as experimental

937
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:21,270
it defines the time capability in net

938
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:23,630
conf and what we're proposing here is to

939
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:28,079
leverage the time capability and

940
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:32,160
actually we may be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to apply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font>

941
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:33,780
the rib data model to the data model

942
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:37,649
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is defined in a current working</font>

943
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:40,020
group so for example we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can have a route</font>

944
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:42,510
add operation which includes the

945
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:46,349
scheduled time operation so it the

946
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:50,250
scheduled time parameter so this can

947
00:51:46,349 --> 00:51:52,140
define for this route add when the

948
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:56,790
router is expected to perform the right

949
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:59,609
ad so this specifies the time at which

950
00:51:56,790 --> 00:52:05,550
we expect this RPC to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

951
00:51:59,609 --> 00:52:08,670
performed next please so the main

952
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:15,260
purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this this short slot is to</font>

953
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:17,460
get feedback to see if there's any I

954
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:20,210
think if<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is motivation in the</font>

955
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:24,030
working group to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pursue this we may</font>

956
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:25,190
proceed with actually writing drafts

957
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:29,790
about

958
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:33,480
damn<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bogdanovic so the only how will you</font>

959
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:37,110
know or how the system will know what is

960
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:39,240
the current load of the control plane on

961
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:42,030
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device and how long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it take to</font>

962
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,910
process that and push it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down because</font>

963
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:47,190
this is an unknown so you can time it

964
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:50,430
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> still you don't know when that</font>

965
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:53,130
will be active on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wire and that time</font>

966
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:55,560
difference between<font color="#CCCCCC"> the applied config</font>

967
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:58,890
you know and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are what's getting down</font>

968
00:52:55,560 --> 00:53:00,660
on the wire is an unknown it depends on

969
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:02,850
us you know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a device to the device</font>

970
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:07,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you will get in you know</font>

971
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:09,299
consistently other things you know your

972
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,700
network consists out and seek wanton

973
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,530
that perspective so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I</font>

974
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,419
understand a question you're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

975
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:17,930
we're not sure what's the propagation

976
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:23,700
delay between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client and the server</font>

977
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:28,379
so this may affect the internal delay in

978
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:30,240
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device okay so so basically it's an</font>

979
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:34,100
implementation question of how do we

980
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:38,939
guarantee<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the server or the router</font>

981
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:40,740
actually performs the update exactly at

982
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:45,150
the time it was meant to perform the

983
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:47,819
update<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so can we go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to slides ahead</font>

984
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:51,000
please certainly I would be glad to but

985
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:57,860
this way two slides ahead not backwards

986
00:53:51,000 --> 00:54:01,710
but tell me win go down slide in 11

987
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:04,200
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that the question is</font>

988
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:05,850
actually can we performed operations in

989
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:09,750
an accurate way it's an implementation

990
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:11,400
question no that's not the question no

991
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:13,830
it is a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

992
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer because this is you know the</font>

993
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:18,390
silicon level but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asking you when</font>

994
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:21,330
you hit the cut the CPU on the device

995
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:22,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">that cpu on the device the question is</font>

996
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:26,610
how will I know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CP on the</font>

997
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:30,840
device to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your silicon down that's one</font>

998
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:32,970
question once yeah if you okay look wait

999
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:35,670
I want to answer the questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> well if I</font>

1000
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:38,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">may if you assume that the hardware</font>

1001
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:40,049
underlying has time capability

1002
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:42,630
then yes you can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it happen</font>

1003
00:54:40,049 --> 00:54:45,660
magically right from a point of view<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1004
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:49,680
a protocol design we can't design around

1005
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:51,269
that assumption and that was and if you

1006
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,009
don't make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> assumption if you assume</font>

1007
00:54:51,269 --> 00:54:54,859
there's a route control processor that

1008
00:54:53,009 --> 00:54:57,029
is controlling the line card and

1009
00:54:54,859 --> 00:54:58,950
changing its state when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to</font>

1010
00:54:57,029 --> 00:55:01,289
change its state which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the way we</font>

1011
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:02,609
normally think about these things there

1012
00:55:01,289 --> 00:55:05,940
is a time delay but I actually have a

1013
00:55:02,609 --> 00:55:07,589
much bigger problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> here we spent a</font>

1014
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,569
significant amount of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

1015
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:12,089
working group looking at this question

1016
00:55:09,569 --> 00:55:14,250
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> debated a number of dimensions of</font>

1017
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:17,160
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it turns out that in trying</font>

1018
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:20,130
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> combine this with I to RS there are a</font>

1019
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:22,529
lot of complexities that arise and we

1020
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:24,390
decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> no we don't want to deal with</font>

1021
00:55:22,529 --> 00:55:27,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">for example wait a minute I have a</font>

1022
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:29,038
preemption so this is gone but maybe by

1023
00:55:27,089 --> 00:55:30,900
the time it really takes effect the

1024
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:33,539
preemption<font color="#E5E5E5"> its will be gone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so it</font>

1025
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:36,420
should take effect and so we looked at

1026
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:39,779
keeping whole piles of<font color="#E5E5E5"> state and so the</font>

1027
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:43,109
unwinding state and we said no we're not

1028
00:55:39,779 --> 00:55:45,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing that I'd really like us to finish</font>

1029
00:55:43,109 --> 00:55:47,700
the current work before we create

1030
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,140
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that large a complexity</font>

1031
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:52,230
footprint I understand why it looks

1032
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:54,900
simple from where you sit and useful

1033
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:57,539
from where you said but when we look at

1034
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:59,940
it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I to RS context it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

1035
00:55:57,539 --> 00:56:02,700
large headache so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1036
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:06,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">uncomfortable with it so Joe your your</font>

1037
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:10,500
your feedback to the chair and to our

1038
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:16,410
work items is put this off till later

1039
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:18,180
did I understand that is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1040
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:20,098
have intended answer the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe</font>

1041
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:22,740
think about it well<font color="#CCCCCC"> let our grass on</font>

1042
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:25,259
other things one conversation tall would

1043
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:28,109
like you to answer the like the answer a

1044
00:56:25,259 --> 00:56:31,019
question to you so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I think</font>

1045
00:56:28,109 --> 00:56:37,288
Joel you you asked an answer but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do</font>

1046
00:56:31,019 --> 00:56:40,169
want to to address the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ends question so</font>

1047
00:56:37,289 --> 00:56:41,970
this solves it at the silicon level so

1048
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:46,140
there is software and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's silicon</font>

1049
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:50,038
the software installs the update ahead

1050
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:50,350
of time a second ahead of time half a

1051
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:52,930
sec

1052
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:54,790
ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time the silicon actually makes</font>

1053
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:57,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">the decision that's the idea here and</font>

1054
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:59,950
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we guarantee that the update</font>

1055
00:56:57,070 --> 00:57:04,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">is actually performed exactly at the</font>

1056
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:07,899
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wanted it to be performed what</font>

1057
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:11,770
can happen in that one second in the

1058
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:14,950
network it can change what you really

1059
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:17,380
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and you're what you install</font>

1060
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:19,000
in the silicon can be obsoleted because

1061
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:22,720
of the event<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has changed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1062
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,370
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> delay there are events and then you</font>

1063
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know what network state you are</font>

1064
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:29,560
changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the software</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can cancel</font>

1065
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:32,920
the I mean once its installed in the

1066
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:37,240
silicon software can access and cancel

1067
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:39,430
it I mean these are I agree these are

1068
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:41,350
implementation questions that we do need

1069
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:44,140
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about an address but if you're</font>

1070
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:47,920
asking me as an implementer is it

1071
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:50,230
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes it's possible we we can't</font>

1072
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:54,610
dismiss it saying it's not possible is

1073
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:58,840
it difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're fun you had</font>

1074
00:57:54,610 --> 00:58:01,060
become a souvenir from<font color="#E5E5E5"> quadrant and not</font>

1075
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:06,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of the use case so about the</font>

1076
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:08,170
mechanism and yesterday we presented the

1077
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:10,950
scheduling configuration scheduling

1078
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:14,920
mechanisms draft in the night mode

1079
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:19,060
working group and so you may want to

1080
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:22,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">check and see if that satisfy for this</font>

1081
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:25,660
kind of thing we have a several separate

1082
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:30,790
different use cases you know man we want

1083
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:34,600
to schedule resources on the particular

1084
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:38,200
schedules so like RSP t links for that's

1085
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:42,700
that's what being implemented in<font color="#CCCCCC"> t is</font>

1086
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:45,220
working group but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pad the scheduling</font>

1087
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:47,740
mechanism is similar right so it's same

1088
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:51,339
thing beside<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's already a</font>

1089
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:53,080
mechanism for the RPC scheduling so

1090
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:55,060
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is already available if it's not</font>

1091
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:58,779
one time scheduling you can use that if

1092
00:58:55,060 --> 00:59:02,420
it's a repeated we need that put in the

1093
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:04,880
datastore we are currently proposing a

1094
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:08,150
free agent scheduling mechanism in that

1095
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:10,640
mode<font color="#CCCCCC"> good thanks thank you thank you</font>

1096
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:12,530
this hits the end of our agenda and

1097
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:16,400
thank you all for<font color="#CCCCCC"> being patient to give</font>

1098
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:21,049
the chair details thank you all right I

1099
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:48,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">think I got all of it who knows it just</font>

1100
00:59:21,049 --> 00:59:48,790
says do more implementation thank you

1101
00:59:53,349 --> 01:00:06,609
hey Justin a wedding<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I prepare over</font>

1102
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:17,629
their security great that makes it

1103
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:24,619
earlier today so sorry like<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening</font>

1104
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:27,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">with everybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> especially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> miss on the</font>

1105
01:00:24,619 --> 01:00:32,210
time this is quite often I precise time

1106
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:35,359
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not important only relative times so</font>

1107
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:38,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">we could do relative time first and</font>

1108
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:40,609
worry about absolute timing lady and

1109
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:43,779
Joel's comment doesn't apply to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the load</font>

1110
01:00:40,609 --> 01:00:43,779
of magic is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Noah</font>

1111
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:55,630
you
