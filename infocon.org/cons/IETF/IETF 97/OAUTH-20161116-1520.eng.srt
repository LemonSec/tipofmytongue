ah alright so we finished Monday this is

9
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:57,630
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little out of order did toe combining</font>

10
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,729
um we were finishing with token exchange

11
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think there were a couple sort of</font>

12
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:06,658
hanging pieces of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end one</font>

13
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,890
was a request um from<font color="#CCCCCC"> torsten in</font>

14
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,658
particular but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's a more</font>

15
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,189
general thing that need to further

16
00:02:09,658 --> 00:02:13,650
explain the relationship between

17
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:15,390
resources the resource parameter the

18
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,400
audience parameter and the scope

19
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,000
parameter and I've talked with them a

20
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,350
little bit off

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,690
I think I know what to do there is

22
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,340
basically just described that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the when</font>

23
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:28,230
when requesting a token you are

24
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:30,150
requesting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scopes at the resource</font>

25
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">and/or audience and if there's more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

26
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">one resource or audience you're</font>

27
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,340
basically asking for the full set of

28
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,459
scopes at any of those one thing at any

29
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,800
of those targets so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll put some more</font>

30
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,110
tea than that Rick<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lera Phi and I'm</font>

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,480
considering<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe adding a specific</font>

32
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,250
error code to for the authorization

33
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,480
server to say it can't do that or<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

34
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,310
unwilling to do that under certain

35
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,100
conditions because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think multiple</font>

36
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">resources multiple audiences might be a</font>

37
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,450
difficult thing for some some systems to

38
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,400
fulfill um if you have thoughts about

39
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:05,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">that chat with me but that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm</font>

40
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:08,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking right now arm there was a hope</font>

41
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,590
to get it to working group last<font color="#E5E5E5"> call at</font>

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">least from me but it sounds like people</font>

43
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">are interested in holding off a little</font>

44
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,140
bit for some implementation experience I

45
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's that was says such as net</font>

46
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:24,929
that the sentiment in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room yeah</font>

47
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:29,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">right I don't I don't remember who such</font>

48
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:35,910
as did that but just to get an idea I'm

49
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:38,519
talking about can you hmm<font color="#CCCCCC"> it yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

50
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:47,760
thanks Mike uh me can you take notes

51
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:50,190
like good you obviously paid attention

52
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,030
during the first meeting yeah that's

53
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:56,190
good um Tony<font color="#CCCCCC"> said he had some developer</font>

54
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,190
feedback he was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring forth</font>

55
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:02,940
hopefully it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in English and</font>

56
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:09,420
actionable and meaningful yeah so do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

57
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:12,350
um so uh who I'm so talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

58
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:15,298
<font color="#CCCCCC">doc needs change when who is currently</font>

59
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:18,750
implementing token exchange for planning

60
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:22,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that raise your hand finding one</font>

61
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,450
two three four<font color="#E5E5E5"> five five that's good so</font>

62
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:28,169
like if we are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to collect the</font>

63
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,420
feedback from those five folks or five

64
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:31,340
groups

65
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:37,400
that would already I think push us

66
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:38,780
forward quite a bit God could maybe I

67
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,489
should maybe we should write down what

68
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:47,179
who those five people are um I saw

69
00:04:42,490 --> 00:05:01,610

would like to present you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new draft as</font>

90
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:18,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">the title suggests it's about security</font>

91
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:20,879
Oh of security and real a brunette and

92
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:24,800
John Bradley and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have wrote this draft</font>

93
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:28,379
and so show the first slide please and

94
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,740
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason it is um we had some</font>

95
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:34,919
discussions in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Berlin about that would</font>

96
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:38,400
be a great idea to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a comprehensive</font>

97
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:41,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">list of all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> topics that are right</font>

98
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,650
now floating around on a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> soft</font>

99
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:47,099
implementation issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> our new security</font>

100
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:50,789
threats and so on arm and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> sat down</font>

101
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:54,500
and try to start work on those draft and

102
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:59,960
the motivation basically is because arm

103
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:04,050
Oh of itself was published in 2012 and

104
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:06,210
got massive traction since then and what

105
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,539
we have seen in the wild is that there

106
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:13,440
are some practical issues with

107
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:17,400
implementing it correctly typically

108
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:21,569
basic stuff like I access RF or openly

109
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,919
directors and so on and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought it</font>

110
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:25,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">would be a good idea to give</font>

111
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,448
recommendations to developers how to do

112
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,659
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> right that's the first motivation</font>

113
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:32,190
second motivation arm my feeling is

114
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:35,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology or the underlying of</font>

115
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:37,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">Technology Oh off changed a bit for</font>

116
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,750
example the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wave fragments are handled</font>

117
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:44,219
in when redirects occur and user agents

118
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:46,830
arm and we should we should analyze<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

119
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:48,240
and then find out what the body

120
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,729
consequences are for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

121
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,639
implicit<font color="#E5E5E5"> grant well there are also</font>

122
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:55,590
changes that will support us in getting

123
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,630
off security tighten up for example the

124
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:01,190
claims URLs which are<font color="#CCCCCC"> supported by some</font>

125
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:03,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the major mobile operating systems</font>

126
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,340
Tony will take some time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to present the</font>

127
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:08,300
slides you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> already in a queue yeah</font>

128
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font>

129
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:17,969
it turned this back to me and last but

130
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:20,789
not least<font color="#E5E5E5"> are when we published off</font>

131
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:24,079
originally arm the typical setup looked

132
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:26,419
very simple there was a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> client</font>

133
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,709
connecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a single a s and</font>

134
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:30,349
interacting with a single resource<font color="#E5E5E5"> / and</font>

135
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:33,269
this is changed significantly

136
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:35,338
significantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> so for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example in in</font>

137
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:37,438
through Paul you<font color="#CCCCCC"> login or federated</font>

138
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:44,720
login scenarios clients typically

139
00:08:37,438 --> 00:08:49,649
connect to more oh thank you that's cool

140
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,480
so I'm in full control again so if you

141
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:52,920
for example take a look into<font color="#E5E5E5"> federated</font>

142
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,870
identity scenarios they are a client

143
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,310
typically connected to more than one IDP

144
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:01,019
and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically have today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in blind</font>

145
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:06,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">all of our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open ID connect and this</font>

146
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:08,220
opens arm and attack angle for things

147
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:10,110
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> mix up attack and so on things we</font>

148
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,399
we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really consider when writing</font>

149
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:16,829
the 60 original security threat model

150
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:18,720
but more is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on or coming up more</font>

151
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:23,189
dynamical scenarios are being used in

152
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:27,930
conjunction with<font color="#E5E5E5"> OAuth and I think those</font>

153
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:30,839
reasons or those different different

154
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:33,120
motivations drove us to to writing this

155
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,779
this RFC because the current security

156
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,970
reconsiderations<font color="#E5E5E5"> RC 67 49 and 50 and the</font>

157
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:42,180
security strap model no longer suffice

158
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:45,360
for that so what's the what's the

159
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,859
intention of this of this draft first of

160
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,959
all this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not intended to become a</font>

161
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,009
standard document<font color="#CCCCCC"> istana tracks document</font>

162
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,399
this is intended to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a working</font>

163
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:57,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">document something we can use to capture</font>

164
00:09:53,399 --> 00:10:00,240
arm everything we we think is worth

165
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,930
capturing about the open topics the

166
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,779
threads the implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues and</font>

167
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:08,910
also write down our the potential

168
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:13,639
mitigations because what I'm observing

169
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:15,250
in the course of the last year<font color="#E5E5E5"> would say</font>

170
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:18,280
we have

171
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:21,040
isolated discussions about one threat or

172
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,540
another we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussions about this</font>

173
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">potential mitigation and another</font>

174
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,490
potential medication where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't come</font>

175
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:30,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">up with a systematic comparison between</font>

176
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:33,280
those mitigations and what we also<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

177
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:36,310
have is a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture which of those</font>

178
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,500
potential mitigations would solve which

179
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:41,290
problems because what I'm dreaming of is

180
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,080
that we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay those are the changes</font>

181
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,790
to all of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the recommendations</font>

182
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:49,150
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> closed all the all the holes that we</font>

183
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:51,969
see today and I would also<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font>

184
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:53,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">capture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the status of discussion and if</font>

185
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:56,170
you take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look on to the drafts by the</font>

186
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:00,579
way has some<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of you already read the</font>

187
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:06,250
draft you're my<font color="#CCCCCC"> hero I mean you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> co</font>

188
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:09,360
awful so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> right okay so I read it as</font>

189
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:11,680
well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you very much your heroes</font>

190
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,730
so if you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look on to the</font>

191
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">draft and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you will see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that before</font>

192
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,510
example for the different medications

193
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:18,010
that we already described we discuss the

194
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,480
pros and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cons for those different</font>

195
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,220
medications so what I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

196
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,690
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with is a document that</font>

197
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:27,490
facilitates the discussion process

198
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:29,410
within the working group and we do not

199
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,690
plan to document all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the threats</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and all</font>

200
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:33,880
the countermeasures in this document but

201
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:36,250
to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of an umbrella document</font>

202
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,960
and to refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to all the drafts that</font>

203
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,640
other people already have written<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

204
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,490
for example John as a draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> and open</font>

205
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:45,460
airy director mike is a drop on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mix-up</font>

206
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:47,680
and so on so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the document as</font>

207
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,870
kind of an umbrella<font color="#CCCCCC"> when all the drafts</font>

208
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,150
exists together to give the context and

209
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:56,680
we can put content in the draft when no

210
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:58,750
other draft exists so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> long term goal</font>

211
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:03,160
from my perspective and the perspective

212
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:05,320
of my my co-authors is we come up with

213
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">ideas what all of extensions we really</font>

214
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:11,260
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to define for example for code</font>

215
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:15,099
injection prevention and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've write</font>

216
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:18,520
down a comprehensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> list of items</font>

217
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:21,670
actions or things a developer needs to

218
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:24,910
implement in order to implement all of

219
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:28,089
in a secure fashion the bullet<font color="#CCCCCC"> I gave</font>

220
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,050
are just examples so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not the</font>

221
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:31,450
real

222
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,069
list what just to get to give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

223
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">impression so that could be a PCP and</font>

224
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,060
either return this document in the PCP

225
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:39,130
or write a new by CP I don't I don't

226
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,109
care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that right so but that's</font>

227
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:43,029
that's the long-term goal so that we

228
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,610
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a real comprehensive</font>

229
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:51,790
description if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it right</font>

230
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:53,950
do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well it's a bit small so</font>

231
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:57,189
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this gives you an impression on</font>

232
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:59,470
what what what the document covers so

233
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,620
far so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> elements in red are the</font>

234
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:04,329
sections that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we already filled and</font>

235
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,190
green or the potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> countermeasures</font>

236
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:08,019
that we are describing so the document

237
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,420
is structured as follows we<font color="#CCCCCC"> first have a</font>

238
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:12,459
section describing the different means

239
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,800
to steal credentials of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> leak</font>

240
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:17,800
credentials and off credentials meaning

241
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,469
access tokens authorization codes

242
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:24,399
refresh tokens and we've got a section

243
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:26,260
describing the different threats

244
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,029
regarding injections the code injection

245
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,600
access hook and injection all this stuff

246
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:34,149
xrf and we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a section about</font>

247
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:38,140
open redirect errs and all the sections

248
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:40,510
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a TBD in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> title are as the</font>

249
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,339
name suggests to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> determined so we</font>

250
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:45,160
focused in the first version we focused

251
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:47,980
on the redirect URI validation leakage

252
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:57,550
via HTTP referer hetal's and fragments

253
00:13:47,980 --> 00:14:01,029
and code injection oops<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

254
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:03,760
perspective if the working group decides

255
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:07,540
to adopt this document and to use it the

256
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">way we are proposing the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

257
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,260
believe is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> next step will be to</font>

258
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,209
complete the description of all the

259
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,560
different threads and the mitigations

260
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:16,959
and to really have a discussion in the

261
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,959
working group about the mitigations

262
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,520
their assessment from client side

263
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:24,609
perspective server perspective cost

264
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,980
perspective complexity perspective all

265
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,510
that all those different aspects that

266
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,390
needs to be into<font color="#E5E5E5"> so taking into account</font>

267
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:36,040
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting the decision to what are we</font>

268
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:38,050
gonna recommend and then we should

269
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:41,199
document that and start work on on on on

270
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:42,150
PCP so that's basically the idea and

271
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,550
from

272
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:46,170
tactical perspective I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to to</font>

273
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,870
get your<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback on under your single</font>

274
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:52,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">magazine makes sense what we proposing</font>

275
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:55,650
and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the next topics you would</font>

276
00:14:52,560 --> 00:15:03,439
like us to cover and us meaning the

277
00:14:55,650 --> 00:15:07,260
working group so that's basically is it

278
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:11,240
yeah Tony<font color="#CCCCCC"> nedlands so we've had a lot of</font>

279
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:17,360
discussion at Microsoft lately about

280
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:21,600
this particular topic and you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

281
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:24,150
and I'm just not quite sure what your

282
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,850
intent is here right there's over 12

283
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:29,069
documents that are in the list today

284
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:32,760
that have been standardized our

285
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:35,640
developers can't piece the 12 together

286
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:39,510
and understand what to do and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

287
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:42,150
to do I think understand and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

288
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,830
know what you'd run what you're trying

289
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,180
to mitigate are you trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to combine</font>

290
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:48,450
them all together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out the</font>

291
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:50,189
mitigations be issues and mitigations

292
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,200
between all the specs when they're used

293
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:57,360
together or you're just talking about

294
00:15:52,200 --> 00:16:00,810
OAuth so I'm a little little confused on

295
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,790
you know what's your total goal is and

296
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:06,140
I'm also you know carrying on the

297
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:08,459
message from from Microsoft that this is

298
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,980
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhat getting out of hand for</font>

299
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:13,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">our developers all the all the specs</font>

300
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,270
that are that are here and how and so

301
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,670
what happens is they wind up creating

302
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:18,900
their own they look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and says I</font>

303
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,969
can't understand it they wind up

304
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:24,180
creating their own stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it just</font>

305
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:27,360
drives us you know nuts at Microsoft

306
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:29,130
good that they have people like you to

307
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,170
explain it it yeah but that's you know

308
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,820
you can t yeah but you can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all</font>

309
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,189
the time right they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know</font>

310
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody says you know they've got a</font>

311
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:39,810
problem to solve and they go off<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do</font>

312
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,130
it and you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no clue what they what</font>

313
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,920
they've done until after it's shipped

314
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:46,350
and they had and somebody has a problem

315
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,030
but it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sounds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I answered a</font>

316
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,580
question yeah because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was erected to</font>

317
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:52,420
me outlet ritual that's it rich or

318
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:59,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">exciting</font>

319
00:16:52,420 --> 00:17:00,889
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just thought okay so i asked you</font>

320
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask for they did I agree I agree with</font>

321
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:05,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you're trying to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here but I</font>

322
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:07,400
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

323
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:10,309
its broad enough surprisingly I would

324
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,919
agree with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I think it's not</font>

325
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:15,559
enough uh what what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus</font>

326
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:17,419
on first all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the obvious problems and</font>

327
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:19,189
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> obvious problems are the threats we</font>

328
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:21,890
have been discussing for a year or now

329
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:26,600
and didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to a conclusion yeah but</font>

330
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:28,520
I understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but that doesn't you</font>

331
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:32,299
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are probably existing threats</font>

332
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:34,010
right we understand that but that's you

333
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,720
don't we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the landscape of</font>

334
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:38,150
everything to understand what the

335
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,830
there's no architecture to this yeah

336
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,179
that's right it's less so first first of

337
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,539
all one of the reasons why we need this

338
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:46,159
document is from my perspective because

339
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:47,539
we didn't really evolved and enhance the

340
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:48,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">securities fraud model the overall</font>

341
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:51,370
security threat model why we were

342
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:53,630
adopting auto specifications namely our

343
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:57,199
dynamic registration for example which

344
00:17:53,630 --> 00:18:00,110
which changed the capabilities of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

345
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot didn't we didn't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that now we</font>

346
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:07,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">somehow try to to to fill those or fill</font>

347
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:10,090
this hole and I also feel that our

348
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:13,189
documents like the RBC p or native apps

349
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:15,620
address a real need so I think beside

350
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:17,690
the specs<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a need to for</font>

351
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,489
recommending best practices not only for

352
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:22,850
security also from a design and

353
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:25,610
architectural standpoint right i mean

354
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:27,469
we're running without much guidance here

355
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,530
maybe that's right maybe this will<font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font>

356
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,390
a little bit more guidance but you know

357
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:34,520
these add-ons aren't making a lot of

358
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:37,789
sense i mean pixie was just a patch I

359
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:40,908
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know well thought</font>

360
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:42,890
out and in something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we</font>

361
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:45,530
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have avoided earlier and so we</font>

362
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:48,710
have these little patches that are been

363
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:50,240
placed around here so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

364
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,679
question folder for the working open

365
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,039
general my personal<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion on that</font>

366
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,980
speaking as<font color="#CCCCCC"> torsten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we like an</font>

367
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,600
architecture overview on a vision and

368
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:02,510
that's why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this pesci a</font>

369
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,790
landscape<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah that's it</font>

370
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:07,510
and may I<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would i would say we need we</font>

371
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:09,950
need more bcp documents for different

372
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:12,440
kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> applications I the other day I</font>

373
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:16,060
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to one of our architects and we</font>

374
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,620
were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to implement</font>

375
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:20,840
multi-tenancy resource service the

376
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,520
resource service that have relationships

377
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,110
with different autorisation service this

378
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,460
is from my perspective and very

379
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,860
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> topic that could be solved</font>

380
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,750
different in different ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font>

381
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:33,979
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> another example where we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really need</font>

382
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:37,250
a PCP or your question take over over

383
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:39,950
dinner on Monday who actually does

384
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:45,980
refresh crop rotation but why because

385
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:49,580
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> documented in the RC yeah thank</font>

386
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:51,100
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tony Benkei duck I also support this</font>

387
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,419
work I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it</font>

388
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:56,540
i'm going to say Kathleen's name to get

389
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,800
her attention but if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a supposed</font>

390
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:00,889
to be used to living document this

391
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,200
particular thing I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you should</font>

392
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">just go ahead and do it and not even</font>

393
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,220
bother asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a working group</font>

394
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,960
adoption because if it's not going to be

395
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">published I mean you only care about</font>

396
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,370
working reproduction by the time you

397
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:17,179
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp why don't you just do</font>

398
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:19,129
the word no not necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't um so</font>

399
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,480
you can still have a document sort of

400
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:23,660
the fact that it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group</font>

401
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,090
document and services as a Dawson said a

402
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:28,220
point for discussion which then points

403
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:32,720
to the documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mitigate specific</font>

404
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:34,490
solutions and<font color="#CCCCCC"> infer the PCB</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> documents</font>

405
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,260
you could still have a lot of value and

406
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:39,170
gives people an indication like what we

407
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:41,780
are we working on rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than having an</font>

408
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:45,740
independent individual submission that

409
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:47,210
is one of many so just to say that

410
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,790
clearly I'm not interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a</font>

411
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:53,600
draft that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just expresses Maya John and</font>

412
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:54,980
Andres opinion I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to gather the</font>

413
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,540
opinion of all the working group members

414
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,220
and to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a conclusion what's</font>

415
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,170
the right mitigation otherwise we want

416
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,390
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a conclusion because what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

417
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:05,690
been observing is we didn't come to any

418
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:11,290
conclusion for any of the of the open

419
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:11,290
security issues in one year<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

420
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:20,570
dick hard I'm so there's two questions I

421
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,820
have one of them is why aren't we

422
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,350
starting on the security bcp right away

423
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,629
as opposed to just just having this

424
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,850
draft like why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just say that</font>

425
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:32,240
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the start of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp or is that</font>

426
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:34,100
what you're saying because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think</font>

427
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leave we have this best</font>

428
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:43,909
current practice right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok in my</font>

429
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:46,100
personal<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion because otherwise it</font>

430
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:48,650
wouldn't be would be named best and no

431
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:53,929
wrong current practice or bad current

432
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:55,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">practice and my other question is what</font>

433
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,410
about sort of broadening the scope of

434
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:59,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">this instead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it just being security</font>

435
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:02,060
that it is just the OAuth best current

436
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,250
practice which i think is tying into

437
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:06,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tony's comment like here's a document to</font>

438
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:08,120
read to know here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best practice on</font>

439
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:17,540
how to do often included in that as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

440
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:19,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">security pieces this is getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> huge if</font>

441
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:23,720
other people support that work yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> do I</font>

442
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:25,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">not yeah I mean you know that the</font>

443
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,260
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> orbis is you need contributors</font>

444
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,870
you know people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that write text people</font>

445
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:33,860
that review the stuff and so on so John

446
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:36,169
Bradley I support having best current

447
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,969
practices I think it's a dot if we

448
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:40,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">decide to start this work I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font>

449
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:43,700
a document management issue that in some

450
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases it may make sense to have modular</font>

451
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:49,160
things like native apps single page

452
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:52,280
applications that developers who are

453
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:55,220
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in how do I use OAuth to do a</font>

454
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:58,010
specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing may find more</font>

455
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,710
approachable but we have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work</font>

456
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:02,390
anyways we we can later decide how we

457
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,910
divided up whether it's one large

458
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,770
monolithic document yeah everybody's

459
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:08,060
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> no matter what we do half the</font>

460
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:09,830
people will decide it was the wrong

461
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:14,750
document structure and it will be torque

462
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:16,879
yeah well be honest is fault so I think

463
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:19,670
we should adopt it it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

464
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">working group document because in some</font>

465
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,000
cases

466
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:29,740
some large organizations and governments

467
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:33,940
etc if it doesn't have an RFC number it

468
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:35,560
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really exist so you know yes we</font>

469
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">can have a living document that that</font>

470
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,030
keeps us all happy but unless we

471
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:42,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">snapshot from time to time when I'm</font>

472
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,930
talking to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just on government and they</font>

473
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,820
say well what's you know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

474
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,620
standard we you know is it an iso

475
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:50,800
standard know it's an ietf standard oh

476
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,870
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess but if it's an individual</font>

477
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:57,760
submission you know they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't take</font>

478
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:59,889
it as seriously I have one question on

479
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:04,210
what Dhoni<font color="#E5E5E5"> was proposal and proposing</font>

480
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:08,140
and what you because a python is a sort

481
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:09,760
of this architecture and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

482
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,980
sure how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that looks like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so for example</font>

483
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,020
the best current practice for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the native</font>

484
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,610
apps in some sense this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

485
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:19,090
architecture because it talks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

486
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:21,850
specific aspect the specific deployment

487
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:24,399
very end then it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> dice a couple of</font>

488
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:26,770
specifications together sort of epic

489
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">architecture something that is or a</font>

490
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:31,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">single architecture is very difficult</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

491
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,720
create in in OS because all along it was

492
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:36,670
used in in very different context so I'm

493
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,470
curious on how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would look like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

494
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:41,380
maybe you guys can earn enlightening

495
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:43,780
John again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think maybe we could have a</font>

496
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,760
stab at an overall architecture but from

497
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,920
a developer point of view I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

498
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">the architecture to do some particular</font>

499
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,410
task is more approachable but somebody

500
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:55,750
who's doing a native app doesn't

501
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:59,740
necessarily need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know about token</font>

502
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:05,530
exchange and various other things you

503
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:09,640
know so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can focus the the BCPS to</font>

504
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:11,530
be more task oriented<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that</font>

505
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,540
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more helpful and I</font>

506
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:16,360
also think that along with bcp like we

507
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:18,760
did with native apps we also at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least in</font>

508
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,709
the open ID foundation we created actual

509
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">open source libraries that developers</font>

510
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:26,220
could look at the code and figure out

511
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,210
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it as examples it's not just</font>

512
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,790
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the high level</font>

513
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:33,940
architecture because developers again

514
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:36,190
relate more to actual code examples or

515
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,559
things that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can incorporate</font>

516
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:42,340
each other their operation that already

517
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,990
what we do today in be just on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monday we</font>

518
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,539
talked about the completion of the

519
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:48,490
native apps work and and you are on the

520
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:51,399
agenda on the last item to talk about

521
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:53,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">future work and and there you will</font>

522
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:56,678
entertain the idea of another best

523
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,330
current practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in those in in the</font>

524
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:00,970
native apps document for those who had

525
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:03,639
read it it points to for example pixie

526
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:07,480
and it this discusses other aspects and

527
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:09,549
so um<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> borrowing whether we are like</font>

528
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,360
what we do whether we are so far off

529
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:15,820
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys are actually talking about</font>

530
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:17,889
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just need to sort of continue along</font>

531
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,850
that line at least from the act I'm

532
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:21,908
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> really about the</font>

533
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:24,219
architecture stuff writing but that

534
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:26,350
still leaves single page applications

535
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,840
what's the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> practice for I have a</font>

536
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:30,610
web service done I have this yeah be

537
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,799
start with one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it was</font>

538
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:34,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">well-received so right we add another</font>

539
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:39,279
one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that's I'm to me it</font>

540
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:40,899
sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a from a um type of</font>

541
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,809
approach to the work seems to be more

542
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:46,239
manageable rather than sort of trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

543
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:48,549
work out the architecture which sir no I

544
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:53,169
yeah i agree with you agreeing with me

545
00:26:48,549 --> 00:27:07,418
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> dick dick do you agree to that</font>

546
00:26:53,169 --> 00:27:12,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">approaches one probably a dozen times of</font>

547
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:14,049
telling people dare go read it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

548
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,809
the good thing about that is that we

549
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:18,580
actually you know William and I have

550
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:20,500
gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of feedback from the</font>

551
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:23,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">development community it hasn't been</font>

552
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:26,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">just us telling them you know this is</font>

553
00:27:23,889 --> 00:27:28,959
the way to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> um well mostly it's</font>

554
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,210
that but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do actually give</font>

555
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,490
us feedback on well have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought of</font>

556
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:36,519
this in this particular environment did

557
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:39,240
you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows acts in this</font>

558
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:41,980
particularly bizarre way et cetera so

559
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">having that feedback from the developers</font>

560
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:47,799
because there is an open source project

561
00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:49,899
is helpful<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so toastin um from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

562
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:52,450
perspective after listening to discuss

563
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:54,040
I think it in the end it would make

564
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:58,090
sense to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> BCPs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for different kinds</font>

565
00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:00,520
of things as<font color="#CCCCCC"> their a dick call it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

566
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:01,840
different kinds of kinds of clients but

567
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,310
also for different scenarios and

568
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,500
different all kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> resource</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

569
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:07,960
authorization service the question is

570
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,090
how to approach that and and which<font color="#CCCCCC"> tpc</font>

571
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:13,090
which PCP is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right down and I think</font>

572
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:15,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">if we write BCPs for this those</font>

573
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:17,500
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> arm clients types that we</font>

574
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:20,890
should also incorporate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security</font>

575
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,780
stuff but I also think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

576
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,040
securities fraud model and the analysis

577
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:27,550
and the mitigations are cross-cutting

578
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:30,580
concerns so um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes a lot of</font>

579
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:32,560
sense to to to to work this way and then

580
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:36,780
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to decide which BCPs to to write</font>

581
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:39,250
in afterwards that would be my proposal

582
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:41,740
so I'd agree with that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's good</font>

583
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:45,790
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the security all-in-one bcp and</font>

584
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:48,820
then you could have the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> BCPs that</font>

585
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:51,760
are say talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a single page flow</font>

586
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:55,899
say to refer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security bcp for</font>

587
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:58,450
people see what you're saying more or

588
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:01,060
less yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> iiiii i'm rather reluctant to</font>

589
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,770
call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp but um I can live us out</font>

590
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:10,480
early<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah it's just an informational</font>

591
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:11,860
draft run so ah discussion huh if they

592
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,690
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not about Disney's this is this</font>

593
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,790
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't i don't</font>

594
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:18,790
care about process but what content wise

595
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:20,680
re-interview what would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

596
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:23,889
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us already the substantial</font>

597
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:27,100
of valuable feedback if people could

598
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:31,570
tell us which types of client and which

599
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:33,250
scenarios they carry the most so would

600
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,260
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> especially</font>

601
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:39,180
into JavaScript apps or a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> page</font>

602
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:41,440
apps or whatever because in the end

603
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:43,960
redirect URI validation for example

604
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,030
works completely different for those

605
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,200
different client types and we need to

606
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:53,020
anyhow i distinguish those in the draft

607
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,000
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh what I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> suggest will</font>

608
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:58,540
oppose the message to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list or so and</font>

609
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,390
people can can can can propose which

610
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:03,250
which scenarios which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

611
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:03,700
applications clients and back-end system

612
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:07,120
they want

613
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:11,529
us too to<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider and but will be also</font>

614
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:14,918
an indication where we need pc ps4 let's

615
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:17,679
have William<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh say something hi yeah I</font>

616
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:20,289
actually think this should be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DCP and</font>

617
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:24,070
that it probably should obsolete RFC

618
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:26,289
6890 if possible and what what I like

619
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,639
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp model is that it does</font>

620
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:29,679
allow that kind of snapshotting that

621
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:31,120
that people been talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so which</font>

622
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,440
i think is a valuable thing now and

623
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,658
people you know last cool to give that

624
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,190
stable identifier for all the security

625
00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:45,460
issues so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm definitely supported over</font>

626
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:50,559
security bcp<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay seems everybody wants</font>

627
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:57,730
a piece ep I'm fine I'm convinced okay

628
00:30:50,559 --> 00:31:01,029
um what yeah let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh so um I will ask</font>

629
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:04,240
who is are in favor against adoption of

630
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:07,419
the document that<font color="#E5E5E5"> um toss was just</font>

631
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,610
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> um and introducing to us</font>

632
00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:11,830
so please raise your hand if you're in

633
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:17,500
favor of adopting that document as a

634
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:22,870
working group item<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see about yeah two</font>

635
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:27,149
four six<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight nine nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beyond</font>

636
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:29,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">certain hands husa again against uh I'm</font>

637
00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:33,939
adopting this document is working to

638
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:45,039
bite them no no he he races no no no no

639
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:48,210
he's an elegy don't wake him up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

640
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:52,570
perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah that was Kia so there was a</font>

641
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:59,679
strong like like 15 people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> favor</font>

642
00:31:52,570 --> 00:32:03,309
nobody against and so yeah okay okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah</font>

643
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:13,110
good thanks good thanks

644
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:13,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oh go there let's make us great again</font>

645
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:31,928
you'd be remiss not to all right we good

646
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:35,499
uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the owl do Oh does it work yeah</font>

647
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:38,169
it works awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay uh so I want to</font>

648
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:40,179
talk about what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> currently listed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

649
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:41,740
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> OAuth age should be signing draft</font>

650
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:43,330
the whole motivation behind the entire

651
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:46,090
pop architecture was to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

652
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:47,889
that was roughly in parity with bearer

653
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:49,928
tokens so you need a way to get a token

654
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:52,269
need a way to use the token need various

655
00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:54,360
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to validate the token as it's being</font>

656
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:58,539
presented at the protected resource and

657
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,879
so getting a token is really um pretty

658
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:01,929
much the same except that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get a key</font>

659
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:04,029
associated with that we've got a

660
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:05,379
different document that's working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

661
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:07,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that whether or not the client</font>

662
00:33:05,379 --> 00:33:09,009
presents the key or has the key issued

663
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,469
by the EAS we're not talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

664
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:12,669
here right now validating a token we

665
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:15,100
toss our<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands up in the air and say</font>

666
00:33:12,669 --> 00:33:16,809
it's up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it out but</font>

667
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,580
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got introspection jot</font>

668
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:20,289
and a bunch of other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

669
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,610
need to be adapted<font color="#CCCCCC"> for use in the pop</font>

670
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:23,619
world what's interesting in this

671
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:26,590
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the middle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one is how do</font>

672
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:28,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">you use one of these pop tokens so you</font>

673
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:30,789
go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this work to associate a</font>

674
00:33:28,029 --> 00:33:32,860
key with the token and how do you get it

675
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:36,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">over to the protected resource so what</font>

676
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:38,379
we have right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a presentation spec</font>

677
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:40,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">that includes signing presentation of</font>

678
00:33:38,379 --> 00:33:44,230
the token itself and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> method for</font>

679
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:48,100
protecting the HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> request in various</font>

680
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:50,379
ways and bit of a historical note here

681
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,519
all these three are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wrapped up</font>

682
00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:53,830
together inside of a single

683
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,110
specification because originally i wrote

684
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:58,809
a draft spec<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually only did the</font>

685
00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:01,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">last bit hoping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that hoping and assuming</font>

686
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:02,590
that somebody else would write the bits

687
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:05,259
for how to do the signing and how to do

688
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:07,090
the presentation and nobody did so

689
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:09,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">eventually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i added those in and said</font>

690
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:11,168
like okay this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you kind of do the</font>

691
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,719
whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the signing bits for the</font>

692
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:16,179
HTTP request message are really optional

693
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:17,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">additions on top of that however that</font>

694
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,430
seems to really confuse

695
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:21,250
use a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

696
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:23,350
break down today<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly how these</font>

697
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">things all fit together first off we've</font>

698
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:26,860
got signing and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you take</font>

699
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:28,540
a JSON object you put your access token

700
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,980
inside of it you put currently it's in

701
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:32,469
there as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> timestamp it could be a nonce</font>

702
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:35,590
I really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care just some way to</font>

703
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:39,219
have a non-repeatable transactional kind

704
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:41,950
of thing of some type in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

705
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:44,199
wrap<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON web stick signature</font>

706
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:47,409
and sign it with the key associated with

707
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:49,299
the token really not hard since we're

708
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:50,799
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> josé there's a crypto agility re</font>

00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,490
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a JWT incidentally because this</font>

715
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,690
is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really an assertion it's not</font>

716
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:06,669
carrying sort of application<font color="#CCCCCC"> level</font>

717
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:08,830
information that a jot normally would

718
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:12,450
but we are using the jws<font color="#E5E5E5"> general-purpose</font>

719
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:14,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">structure for carrying this stuff over</font>

720
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:19,120
presenting the token is really in

721
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:20,649
parallel with 6750 so chuck it in a

722
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,170
header chuck<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> form body checking</font>

723
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:25,240
in query parameter we did all three with

724
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:27,940
pretty much the same caveats and

725
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,680
limitations that 6750 has because that

726
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:31,900
honestly hasn't really changed all that

727
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,690
much in the last four years except for

728
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:37,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">the fact that the middle one is I would</font>

729
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:40,150
honestly be willing to drop the form

730
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,780
parameter because back when we wrote Oh

731
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:46,030
off to form encoded in JSON out was sort

732
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:47,800
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rule of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day for writing</font>

733
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:51,310
an API these days that's just not true

734
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's JSON and both JSON out so I'd be</font>

735
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:55,690
happy to drop<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one I don't think we</font>

736
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:57,490
really lose anything for having it in or

737
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,510
out of there the other two I do think

738
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:00,939
are important because they have very

739
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:03,100
specific use cases and yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do even</font>

740
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:04,600
mean the query parameter but that's not

741
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I'm here to argue today when I'm</font>

742
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,020
here to argue today is the third bit is

743
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:10,270
and that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the HTTP message</font>

744
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:11,860
signing this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ofone did</font>

745
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:14,110
that OAuth 2 doesn't now there's very

746
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,850
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons that OAuth 2 dozen part of</font>

747
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:19,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is that a lot of developers got</font>

748
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:21,190
this wrong in both one and we know this

749
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,480
we know this because many of us in this

750
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,920
room and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in many of us that were</font>

were<font color="#CCCCCC"> o auth one developers and we're</font>

753
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,450
tired of screwing things up and having

754
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:31,820
other developers trying to interoperate

755
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:34,339
us screwing this part of the process up

756
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,890
however it still is valuable in a lot of

757
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:38,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">cases to protect the HTTP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> request</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

759
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,140
type and so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea here is that the</font>

760
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:44,270
signature that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are generating is</font>

761
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:46,490
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> associated with the same</font>

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,119
had before well what we're going to do

765
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:55,250
is we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to create a</font>

detached signature of the HTTP message

767
00:36:55,250 --> 00:37:00,589
now unlike existing HTTP signature

768
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:03,410
methods that are out there so AWS has

769
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:05,328
their own proprietary one there been a

770
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:07,609
few others<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are floating around this</font>

771
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:10,130
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> does not assume that the HTTP</font>

772

message remains unscathed throughout the

773
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:14,570
process instead it very much admits that

774
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:16,220
lots of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go wrong in the</font>

middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it what that means is that</font>

776
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:22,009
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a this is not just take the</font>

778
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:26,900
signature then take it exactly as is and

779
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,118
re-sign it on the other side no<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead</font>

780
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,560
that this is designed<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a world where</font>

781
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,270
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> get manipulated in the middle</font>

782
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,069
headers get injected query parameters

783
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:35,060
get mucked around all kinds of stuff

784
00:37:34,069 --> 00:37:37,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that you know the stuff that</font>

785

actually happens in the real world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

786
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:43,550
so you only sign the stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

787
00:37:40,339 --> 00:37:45,470
as part of your API as part of your

788
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:47,690
deployment as part of your documentation

789
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:49,368
you only sign the stuff that you know is

790
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,810
worth signing that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get</font>

791
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:52,760
screwed<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on the way through and it's</font>

up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the application on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the far side to</font>

793
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure that the stuff that comes in</font>

00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:58,759
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide is the stuff that it cares</font>

795
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:01,609
about and the stuff that makes sense for

796
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,380
it to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do its job yes this is</font>

797
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:05,619
a compromised position and I think that

798
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:09,140
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually a reasonable compromise</font>

799
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:11,270
given the complexity of the HTTP

800
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,618
protocol and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the complexity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of HTTP</font>

801
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:14,569
deployments in all of the different ways

802
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:16,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can get screwed up on the way</font>

803
00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:20,000
through any given process anybody that's

804
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:22,069
done a reverse proxy or any type of HTTP

805
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,569
application framework will know the pain

806
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:26,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this can cause if you have</font>

807
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:29,869
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that assumes sort of you know</font>

808
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:32,960
static pristine preservation of the HTTP

809
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:35,060
messages on either end IE anybody that's

810
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,960
tried to write an<font color="#CCCCCC"> oauth one client in</font>

811
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:41,660
any of those situations now anyway um

812
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,170
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not fully comprehensive there</font>

813
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,480
are some corner cases that it doesn't

814
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:48,420
cover<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've enumerated those and</font>

815
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,040
just said that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font>

816
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,410
you have stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fits in these cases</font>

817
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,420
don't sign that bit you can't sign it so

818
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:56,970
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of making this try to bend over</font>

819
00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:00,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">backwards to fit every last weird corner</font>

820
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:01,950
case of HTTP of which there are a lot we

821
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:03,480
just said this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't this doesn't do</font>

822
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:07,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">that part it doesn't go that far and</font>

823
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:10,500
that's that's ok so you sign what makes

824
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,599
sense that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really kind of the the gist</font>

825
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,359
of this whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point here</font>

826
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:17,549
is that this is all optional this is all

827
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:19,650
optional in today's draft spec you add

828
00:39:17,549 --> 00:39:21,839
these components<font color="#CCCCCC"> in to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the base</font>

829
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:24,569
signature the base signatures over the

830
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:27,000
access token which is being<font color="#E5E5E5"> presented as</font>

831
00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:28,410
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> uninterpreted by the client still</font>

832
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,750
opaque to the client just like a bearer

833
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:32,700
token and that nonce<font color="#E5E5E5"> timestamp</font>

834
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:35,309
transactional identifier whatever we end

835
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:38,730
up wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it this is all in</font>

836
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:41,460
addition to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you only</font>

837
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:43,859
add this stuff in if it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense for</font>

838
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:47,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">you to do so in your API</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if your</font>

839
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:49,799
application needs it so what I propose

840
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:52,020
since this still seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> confuse people</font>

841
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:54,930
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we just split this into two</font>

842
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:56,549
documents we put the HTTP signing in a

843
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:58,828
separate document how it was in the

844
00:39:56,549 --> 00:40:01,559
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> place and we put the core signing</font>

845
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:03,839
bits in their own document and we move

846
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:05,130
the two forward together and if somebody

847
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,720
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise a stink and say that the</font>

848
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:08,579
HTTP signing is experimental I'm

849
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,000
actually okay with that because it kind

850
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:14,760
of is because signing HTTP is really

851
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,280
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard as it turns out and we have</font>

852
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:20,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">not yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had a single comprehensive</font>

853
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,250
solution that I have seen now remember

854
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:25,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is in fact in a detached signature</font>

855
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:28,339
this is not taking the entire HTTP

856
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:31,558
message and uh sort of you know

857
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:34,349
encapsulating it inside the jws nor is

858
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:37,079
it assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the HTTP message keeps</font>

859
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:39,089
some pristine format outside of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the jdub</font>

860
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:43,559
so it's not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike can you remind me</font>

861
00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:46,980
what the the external jws is called<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

862
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:49,619
you wrote it you wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> it whatever</font>

863
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:54,089
Mike's last draft and Jose was it's not

864
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:55,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">that either thanks anyway so my</font>

865
00:40:54,089 --> 00:40:56,790
suggestion is that we move both of these

866
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,890
uh

867
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:02,460
both of these forward if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mark</font>

868
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:05,430
the HTTP signing and and and have them

869
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,650
cross-reference each other um so have

870
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:09,299
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say and hey if you want</font>

871
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:11,520
to add protection for the HTTP message

872
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:14,610
components here's a way to do that and

873
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,870
have the HTTP signing thing say well

874
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to tell you how to hash</font>

875
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,060
the message how to do all the

876
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,260
verification you're going to have to put

877
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:22,860
it somewhere you might want to put it

878
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:24,150
into a no op op signed request alright

879
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:27,480
so we put the signing and presentation

880
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:29,670
in one document HTTP message hatching

881
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,680
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> attached signatures inside another</font>

882
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:37,530
document move both of them forward

883
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:39,839
publish it call it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a day yeah um so I</font>

884
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:42,840
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there has been some chatter</font>

885
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:45,030
about alternate presentation mechanisms

886
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,930
because it seems that some people forget

887
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,940
that if we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be doing all this</font>

888
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:49,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">work with our pop we need to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

889
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,830
send the token from the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

890
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:54,839
resource server in some fashion um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

891
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:56,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't seen any concrete proposals that</font>

892
00:41:54,840 --> 00:42:01,160
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if there were additional</font>

893
00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:05,280
concrete proposals that's fine we have

894
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:06,540
6750 and whatever the kitten one is did

895
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,480
the kitten know offing do you remember

896
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:11,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">safley yeah this is the sasal gssapi</font>

897
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,980
thing whatever number that one is we've

898
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">got both of those and they don't fight</font>

899
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,640
because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing different kinds of</font>

900
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,660
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get the token in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

901
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,980
way and use it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> different ways</font>

902
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,899
depending on what kind of API you're

903
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,960
talking to and everybody gets along just

904
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:27,540
fine same kind of things happening here

905
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:30,540
so that was always the intent that's why

906
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:33,240
token presentation was pulled out as a

907
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:36,810
separate document in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> early days</font>

908
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:39,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">early ish days of OAuth 2 to allow that</font>

909
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:41,009
kind of protocol flexibility we're

910
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,899
inheriting that and embracing that here

911
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:44,910
so if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a different way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

912
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,950
present pop token go for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I haven't</font>

913
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:49,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">seen any yet but if somebody comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

914
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:52,680
with one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't mean that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

915
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:54,630
one's not useful also side note<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

916
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:57,509
actually implemented this both server

917
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:59,130
and client side and a couple of other

918
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:00,750
people have done I've done their

919
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:03,210
versions of it as well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this</font>

920
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:06,690
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that does exist it's not a</font>

921
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:09,660
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has a universal applicability</font>

922
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:10,650
but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that so bearer tokens get</font>

923
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,589
the job done in

924
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:15,120
a lot of cases and that's fine this is

925
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:18,090
for cases where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to kind of pay</font>

926
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:22,859
the extra costs and and get the extra

927
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:25,650
benefits exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all I</font>

928
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:28,740
gaya clan is open and I guess Benkei

929
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:31,770
duck so I was reading really<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast when I</font>

930
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:35,520
read the draft do you talk any about

931
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:37,620
doing discovery for like when you learn

932
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the API you also learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about which</font>

933
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:43,200
parameters should be included in the

934
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:46,440
signature um so yeah we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't actually</font>

935
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,810
address discovery because discovery is

936
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:52,620
kind of a black magic voodoo box in the

937
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:54,750
OAuth world and it is and so how the

938
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:57,839
client knows even which server to talk

939
00:43:54,750 --> 00:44:00,930
to oooff doesn't care and we we

940
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:04,500
inherited that attitude so we could we

941
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:08,609
do say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I forget the exact word but</font>

942
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:12,450
we do say something like the API must

943
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:15,330
document or something like that which

944
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:17,939
things that expects to be signed but we

945
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:20,040
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that means yeah we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do so</font>

946
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have this somebody who remember</font>

947
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,850
discussion on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monday we had this</font>

948
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,740
discussion about metadata<font color="#CCCCCC"> and never</font>

949
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:27,089
smell a date that for example also<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

950
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:30,870
the resource so where this could

951
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:32,310
potentially belong to I um but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

952
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:34,259
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's there because the work</font>

953
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:36,690
is still at the yeah there's definitely

954
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,430
no structured or automated thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

955
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:41,190
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some language that says you got</font>

956
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:42,960
to write it down but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't we</font>

957
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:46,140
probably should yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it probably</font>

958
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:48,090
also some security considerations about

959
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:50,580
that because if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not oh yeah we</font>

960
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:53,060
what you sign no we definitely do have

961
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:55,049
security considerations about that

962
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,400
thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Phil we've also got some</font>

963
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:59,730
security considerations about things

964
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,070
like argument order and a couple of

965
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:04,200
other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that aren't necessarily</font>

966
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:06,870
strictly preserved by the by the hashing

967
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:09,299
process so it basically like if these

968
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,500
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> really matter to you this isn't</font>

969
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to give you that information</font>

970
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,630
you've gotta have some other way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

971
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:17,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure that that works so yeah we did we</font>

972
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:20,010
definitely do say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because that was</font>

973
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:22,169
actually the root of a really big

974
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:25,250
problem in open ID<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

975
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:29,250
real<font color="#E5E5E5"> world exploit with opa 90 to where</font>

976
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:32,430
providers were taking in taking in

977
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:33,840
messages validating the signature and

978
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:37,259
then just assuming that everything that

979
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:40,080
came in was signed which isn't the case

980
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:42,150
and this is really kind of its taking

981
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:44,819
the same approach it's you list what you

982
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:47,700
signed and you sign that and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

983
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:49,680
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing the same thing so that</font>

984
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">this was not fully invented out of whole</font>

985
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,480
cloth it's based on that same pattern

986
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:58,500
but it has the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exact same</font>

987
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:01,170
drawback so yeah as as an RS<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if you</font>

988
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:03,300
care about a parameter being signed and

989
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:06,180
it's left out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> signature but its</font>

990
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,980
present in the request that's got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

991
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:12,359
a problem but it's all it's up to the RS

992
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:17,850
to figure that out and he for a feedback

993
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:20,190
go up so at the last at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> buena idea</font>

994
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:25,440
for meeting which has been unfortunately

995
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:27,630
wasn't present from did we had and at

996
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">that time we also adopted the dough</font>

997
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:31,890
combining work sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of is a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

998
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:33,620
of bad at that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got thoughts this</font>

999

since we're working on<font color="#CCCCCC"> tow combining we</font>

1022
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:56,060
we should stop this work you only own

split the documents been done for ages

1028
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:22,850
there's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really been additional</font>

1029
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:24,710
feedback there's a handful<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1030
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:27,859
implementations it's just the working

1031
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:35,540
group has not said kick it out the door

1032
00:48:27,859 --> 00:48:37,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">and go from my perspective so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cart</font>

1033
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:42,020
has there been<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone that's deployed or</font>

1034
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:46,820
tried to deploy not at like the Amazon

1035
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:50,060
scale if that's what you mean but in

1036
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:52,640
small pockets yeah my concern is the

1037
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:53,869
worry that if we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and we</font>

1038
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,549
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really thought it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the way</font>

1039
00:48:53,869 --> 00:48:58,160
through and it isn't all the way baked

1040
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:59,990
it's yet another<font color="#E5E5E5"> spec for people trying</font>

1041
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">to figure out what to do with I wanted</font>

1042
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:05,390
to do and potentially leads the more

1043
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:07,819
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of incompatibility of people trying</font>

1044
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:09,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">to make things work together torsten is</font>

1045
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:14,270
going to fix<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with the bcp we're</font>

1046
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:16,910
fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi rich Saul's is a stranger um why</font>

1047
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:19,840
would splitting if it's been stuck for a

1048
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:23,180
year why would splitting it unstick it

1049
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:25,280
because some of the lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the comments</font>

1050
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:28,399
about not moving it forward or about the

1051
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">HTTP message hashing and signing portion</font>

1052
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,000
and not about the token presentation

1053
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:34,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's like the caboose each will cut</font>

1054
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,560
off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and let the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rest go forward right</font>

1055
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:37,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly and you know this isn't the</font>

1056
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,609
first time this working group has done

1057
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:45,200
that in order to unstick things<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1058
00:49:40,609 --> 00:49:46,759
i was gonna say more or less they should

1059
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,890
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> signing has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

1060
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:52,670
the sticking point for a lot of people I

1061
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:57,109
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so maybe there's more hope for it</font>

1062
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:58,850
with just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the presentation II sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

1063
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:00,680
sidebar question is is there any

1064
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:05,500
mechanism in the presentation though

1065
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:07,520
that that keeps a token from being

1066
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:10,160
presented by the resource server to

1067
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:13,790
another resource server yes yeah yeah

1068
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:15,529
asymmetric<font color="#CCCCCC"> King what did the mechanism</font>

1069
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:17,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">it says the fact that the token is long</font>

1070
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:20,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">to a key no no but yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but you're</font>

1071
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:24,110
signing the token and Anna times down

1072
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:28,550
yeah you you can't present that token

1073
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:31,670
without the signature to another<font color="#E5E5E5"> RS that</font>

1074
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:33,380
and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you present it right you put</font>

1075
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:35,240
those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the signature right of</font>

1076
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,860
the RS can just turn around and<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and</font>

1077
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,750
represent the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole thing represented</font>

1078
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:40,010
yeah you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you need to tie it at</font>

1079
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:42,410
least to some of the other parameters

1080
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:45,320
well that's why the h-2b message signing

1081
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:47,750
was added in there but i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1082
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,580
presentation is is the key aspect of it

1083
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:50,840
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation needs to cover or</font>

1084
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,819
at least consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security</font>

1085
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:55,100
implications yeah huh from my

1086
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:57,440
perspective I would I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer to</font>

1087
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:59,770
see that the presentation sort of fully

1088
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,660
baked in it and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> htp signing</font>

1089
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:04,690
separated and even make it could be

1090
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:08,569
experimental or just dropped but the

1091
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:10,720
presentation needs okay my question then

1092
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:13,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">is how would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do that without</font>

1093
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:17,810
covering portions of the incoming HTTP

1094
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:21,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">requests well yeah that's part that's</font>

1095
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:24,230
one of the fields<font color="#E5E5E5"> of so that's literally</font>

1096
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:25,670
those evolution that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already have so</font>

1097
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:31,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is what I find frustrating about</font>

1098
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:36,650
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation yes right so this is</font>

1099
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:40,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">John Bradley so the token presentment</font>

1100
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:43,700
without actually having an audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

1101
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:46,790
destination as part of that doesn't

1102
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:49,339
actually move the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ball very much further</font>

1103
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:51,800
ahead so if we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to split the</font>

1104
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:53,720
document we should consider some basic

1105
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:57,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">things so that we actually meet the a</font>

1106
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:59,120
worthwhile security goal by having the

1107
00:51:57,110 --> 00:52:00,059
presentment method you mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

1108
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:05,519
like that

1109
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:06,989
um the resource indication oh well yeah

1110
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:08,578
I mean are you gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a URL you're</font>

1111
00:52:06,989 --> 00:52:11,309
gonna do resource identifier what are

1112
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:14,279
you gonna do it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be the host</font>

1113
00:52:11,309 --> 00:52:17,160
that I i<font color="#CCCCCC"> do i'm not making a proposal as</font>

1114
00:52:14,279 --> 00:52:20,309
to what needs to be there but something

1115
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:22,348
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one host can't replay it against</font>

1116
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:24,029
another host so that unless you have to

1117
00:52:22,349 --> 00:52:25,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">API is on the same host and that doesn't</font>

1118
00:52:24,029 --> 00:52:30,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually help you I mean that's just</font>

1119
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:34,140
that's security theater at best so yeah

1120
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:36,209
Rep yeah so the sub again something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1121
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:39,150
identify the resource server otherwise

1122
00:52:36,209 --> 00:52:41,189
work we may not actually be moving the

1123
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:43,289
ball far enough ahead to make it

1124
00:52:41,189 --> 00:52:44,808
worthwhile for people that's true except

1125
00:52:43,289 --> 00:52:46,949
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do audience restriction</font>

1126
00:52:44,809 --> 00:52:49,469
without the presentment mechanism inside

1127
00:52:46,949 --> 00:52:51,719
the token it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> true so I</font>

1128
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:53,219
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all this goes back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1129
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:55,499
discussion we had on Monday<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1130
00:52:53,219 --> 00:52:58,499
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so so the question then is</font>

1131
00:52:55,499 --> 00:53:01,410
that is it that the token can't be used

1132
00:52:58,499 --> 00:53:03,569
at multiple servers or this specific

1133
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:06,089
request and if it's this specific

1134
00:53:03,569 --> 00:53:08,160
request then then we're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

1135
00:53:06,089 --> 00:53:12,749
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about signing what the recoil</font>

1136
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:14,759
this specific request is covered if the

1137
00:53:12,749 --> 00:53:19,259
token itself is appropriately audience

1138
00:53:14,759 --> 00:53:24,329
restriction so maybe unnecessarily but

1139
00:53:19,259 --> 00:53:26,549
go ahead so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's having enough</font>

1140
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:29,429
security considerations to understand

1141
00:53:26,549 --> 00:53:31,410
that this alone without properly

1142
00:53:29,429 --> 00:53:34,349
audience restricting the actual token

1143
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:37,529
you need to use the HDD be signing to

1144
00:53:34,349 --> 00:53:39,410
sign parts of that yeah so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

1145
00:53:37,529 --> 00:53:41,670
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that it actually is</font>

1146
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:44,160
meaningful and actionable and people

1147
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:46,380
don't wind up thinking that they get

1148
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,609
security that they don't that's and

1149
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:49,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's an absolutely fair observation</font>

1150
00:53:50,929 --> 00:53:56,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mike Jones um I was busy taking notes</font>

1151
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:58,799
and didn't repeat my position at the

1152
00:53:56,939 --> 00:54:02,428
time that I'm already on record for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1153
00:53:58,799 --> 00:54:04,769
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we need to do this it's</font>

1154
00:54:02,429 --> 00:54:06,979
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's terrible work per se but</font>

1155
00:54:04,769 --> 00:54:10,979
we're already<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing so many things that</font>

1156
00:54:06,979 --> 00:54:13,200
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's been starved for attention</font>

1157
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:15,900
because we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things that</font>

1158
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:18,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">people consider higher priority and I</font>

1159
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:23,240
haven't seen any ground swell of people

1160
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:25,440
saying we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement this so</font>

1161
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:29,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not clear to me that it's a good</font>

1162
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:30,900
use of our time I've talked to a number

1163
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:32,369
of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are waiting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

1164
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:36,119
published spec before they touch

1165
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:39,619
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this those are the</font>

1166
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:39,619
circles that I tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run in though I</font>

1167
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:47,250
guess we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a saline said put</font>

1168
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:48,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">it to the list it was again a difficult</font>

1169
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:52,260
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we had on a mailing list</font>

1170
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:57,900
um I hope we can make some progress<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1171
00:54:52,260 --> 00:55:02,940
this topic thank you thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just I</font>

1172
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:04,800
think Kathleen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sign that Kathleen</font>

1173
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">Moriarty so this discussion really makes</font>

1174
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:10,170
it sound like it's still pretty stuck so

1175
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:15,830
I put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the list but I I don't know</font>

1176
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:15,830
if there's the drive at the moment I

1177
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:23,279
mean what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chairs think yet again</font>

1178
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:25,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">the slope it's stuck yeah yeah just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

1179
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,930
sure on the list and then yeah the sad

1180
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:30,240
thing is the sad thing is for this stuff

1181
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:33,149
we actually have more implementations

1182
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:35,399
than for some of the other proof

1183
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:41,190
possession mechanism that we have been

1184
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:45,300
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at um okay it don't combining</font>

1185
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:47,820
for example token bindings yeah thank

1186
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:49,890
you and token binding is not a proof of

1187
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:51,930
possession mechanism for possession a

1188
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:53,580
this is just done humanely yeah but it's

1189
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:56,850
not bound<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the chosen itself</font>

1190
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:58,590
necessarily of course it can mercies no

1191
00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:02,810
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a force it is there's a token</font>

1192
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:02,810
that a key there's a key in the token

1193
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:07,619
yes but it doesn't need to be unique if

1194
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:13,680
it doesn't need to be uniquely bound to

1195
00:56:07,619 --> 00:56:16,200
the token dis needa see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this if das is</font>

1196
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:19,980
generating it but anyway but anyway um

1197
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:22,319
doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> um we put that we need to</font>

1198
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:25,140
discuss this on the list<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we have five</font>

1199
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:28,559
minutes left um I'm a beach on<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1200
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:36,470
could come<font color="#CCCCCC"> over here and talk a little</font>

1201
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:44,519
bit about um potential future was<font color="#E5E5E5"> he um</font>

1202
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:55,230
I wasn't going to dance there have been

1203
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:57,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">requests so John Bradley ping so we</font>

1204
00:56:55,230 --> 00:57:01,769
wanted to talk a bit about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1205
00:56:57,329 --> 00:57:03,779
new work so on the resource indicator

1206
00:57:01,769 --> 00:57:09,209
which we've gone around about several

1207
00:57:03,779 --> 00:57:13,019
times Brian and a Ryan reposted our

1208
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:16,079
original draft so I will point out that

1209
00:57:13,019 --> 00:57:19,410
this is essentially the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same mechanism</font>

1210
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:22,500
that as your ad uses and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tony gets</font>

1211
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:24,569
a pal point that out again when<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

1212
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:29,849
objects to it as a matter of principle

1213
00:57:24,569 --> 00:57:38,190
um so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is implementation experience</font>

1214
00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:45,619
uh he's objecting you're confused it's

1215
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:48,869
normal<font color="#CCCCCC"> um the so we should consider</font>

1216
00:57:45,619 --> 00:57:51,769
actually adopting that as as<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

1217
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:56,390
group document I don't know have you

1218
00:57:51,769 --> 00:58:00,180
with sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuck as as an individual</font>

1219
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:03,589
submission I don't so the chairs can

1220
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:07,980
consider whether or not to to adopt that

1221
00:58:03,589 --> 00:58:10,890
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BCPs that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just talked</font>

1222
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:13,410
around William I've had a bunch of

1223
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:15,900
inquiries from Microsoft in other places

1224
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:20,098
around single page applications and what

1225
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:22,230
the best practices are for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm</font>

1226
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:24,269
seeing like lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fortune 100</font>

1227
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:26,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">companies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that have now all decided that</font>

1228
00:58:24,269 --> 00:58:29,848
single page applications are cool but

1229
00:58:26,549 --> 00:58:32,339
have no idea how they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh off</font>

1230
00:58:29,849 --> 00:58:34,460
with single page applications and that

1231
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:36,960
is leading<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some interesting</font>

1232
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:38,819
interpretations<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can tell that he's</font>

1233
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,269
make that face every time he thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1234
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:41,999
it

1235
00:58:39,269 --> 00:58:43,439
uh and it's it's a little in line with

1236
00:58:41,999 --> 00:58:46,379
what we have discussed<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier in the</font>

1237
00:58:43,439 --> 00:58:49,379
meeting when Tony and thick went to the

1238
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:52,619
microphone I think it's a coincidence

1239
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:54,599
but I think there's this more interest

1240
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:57,749
now after<font color="#CCCCCC"> its own native apps so we</font>

1241
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:59,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">should probably do some some polling as</font>

1242
00:58:57,749 --> 00:59:03,209
to which yeah we only have so many

1243
00:58:59,909 --> 00:59:11,989
resources we should decide which topics

1244
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:11,989
we want to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on once we have we have</font>

1245
00:59:12,589 --> 00:59:20,669
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> jasa JWT assertion profile we're</font>

1246
00:59:17,419 --> 00:59:22,769
finishing off token exchanging cetera

1247
00:59:20,669 --> 00:59:24,569
there's a bunch of questions around<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1248
00:59:22,769 --> 00:59:28,049
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bcp topic for</font>

1249
00:59:24,569 --> 00:59:30,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">business-to-business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um you know what</font>

1250
00:59:28,049 --> 00:59:32,249
happens when your RS gets a token and

1251
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:35,969
you actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something with</font>

1252
00:59:32,249 --> 00:59:37,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">it to talk to another Rs so I think we</font>

1253
00:59:35,969 --> 00:59:42,179
have a bunch of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of server-to-server</font>

1254
00:59:37,849 --> 00:59:45,389
documents sort of user not present so

1255
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:48,349
there's probably another DCP that what

1256
00:59:45,389 --> 00:59:50,549
what happens when you have this sort of

1257
00:59:48,349 --> 00:59:53,009
circumstance so that people can actually

1258
00:59:50,549 --> 00:59:59,669
see how those various documents work

1259
00:59:53,009 --> 01:00:01,499
together um there's also uh let ya know

1260
00:59:59,669 --> 01:00:05,189
he's just blocking the microphone for me

1261
01:00:01,499 --> 01:00:07,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I didn't even bank he's going to</font>

1262
01:00:05,189 --> 01:00:09,629
extract such as from me later I know I'm

1263
01:00:07,169 --> 01:00:11,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a spot enjoying the view I just</font>

1264
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:13,349
make one question John uh if you say

1265
01:00:11,669 --> 01:00:15,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">single page application what does it</font>

1266
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:19,380
mean is it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jake JavaScript ok yeah</font>

1267
01:00:15,479 --> 01:00:21,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">that javis people the trendy why I</font>

1268
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:22,619
didn't even know when I first heard it

1269
01:00:21,269 --> 01:00:25,348
there people were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about single</font>

1270
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:27,209
page app I had no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's no</font>

1271
01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:30,779
posts for the snow gets requests yeah so

1272
01:00:27,209 --> 01:00:34,799
so out on the intertubes people refer to

1273
01:00:30,779 --> 01:00:37,529
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pattern of having a having</font>

1274
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:41,509
javascript in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> executing in the</font>

1275
01:00:37,529 --> 01:00:47,399
browser making web calls and<font color="#CCCCCC"> API calls</font>

1276
01:00:41,509 --> 01:00:50,189
using fetcher in various other

1277
01:00:47,399 --> 01:00:52,950
mechanisms as single page applications

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay toasting again so I'm</font>

1279
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:57,868
what support what you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> hanas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1280
01:00:54,869 --> 01:01:00,210
if we make an enquiry let<font color="#E5E5E5"> people give</font>

1281
01:00:57,869 --> 01:01:02,550
feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> on where they see a real lead</font>

1282
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:05,400
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> piece because we we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have not that</font>

1283
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:08,960
plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of capacity and I think we should</font>

1284
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:16,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">focus on the most relevant arm bc piece</font>

1285
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:18,960
the more the most relevant bc piece Tony

1286
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:22,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">nodland</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just two for the record we don't</font>

1287
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:24,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily use a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> single page it's we</font>

1288
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:27,060
have a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> applications that use that</font>

1289
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:29,729
that's not our main main driving force

1290
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:32,220
in Azure the as your people have been

1291
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:34,710
asking making inquiry there are certain

1292
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:39,379
as I said there are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> my girl as your</font>

1293
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:39,380
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean as you're okay</font>

1294
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:53,040
so okay so you ran<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of time there</font>

1295
01:01:50,609 --> 01:01:55,740
there are eight people who want to make

1296
01:01:53,040 --> 01:02:00,089
single page applications and God help

1297
01:01:55,740 --> 01:02:03,240
them some of them use as your butt on

1298
01:02:00,089 --> 01:02:09,150
that doesn't know yeah we are we ran out

1299
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:11,189
of time um okay um but i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what</font>

1300
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:15,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm going to do is um i would boost a</font>

1301
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:18,930
message to the list<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort of ask for</font>

1302
01:02:15,589 --> 01:02:20,400
the type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for pcbs that people</font>

1303
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:24,000
have and then we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out on</font>

1304
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:27,359
how which one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those actually we can</font>

1305
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,190
work on first and which ones we have we

1306
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:34,520
were late we also have some sort of

1307
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:38,220
lingering work around post message for

1308
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:42,359
authentication which probably depending

1309
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:45,689
upon whether or not we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> are post</font>

1310
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:47,549
message for to replace using post

1311
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:51,119
message to replace fragment encoding

1312
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:54,690
which whether or not we go forward with

1313
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:56,130
that somehow would impact on what the

1314
01:02:54,690 --> 01:03:00,770
best practice for single page

1315
01:02:56,130 --> 01:03:03,540
applications actually is twisting

1316
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:04,869
postmessage just rang a bell in my head

1317
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:11,609
so I'm Tolson

1318
01:03:04,869 --> 01:03:14,499
I think yeah you distracted me<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> man I</font>

1319
01:03:11,609 --> 01:03:16,779
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> our document can potentially</font>

1320
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:18,549
provide as the justification why it

1321
01:03:16,779 --> 01:03:21,339
makes sense to to have a postmessage

1322
01:03:18,549 --> 01:03:24,549
mechanism instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our redirects for</font>

1323
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:26,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">fragments right so i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it was tested</font>

1324
01:03:24,549 --> 01:03:28,059
could be one could be one way to pursue

1325
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:30,339
ought to to to approach that topic yet

1326
01:03:28,059 --> 01:03:33,160
just as if<font color="#E5E5E5"> he is more complicated there</font>

1327
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:35,828
are lots of hidden gotchas so that

1328
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:38,410
probably also requires an open source

1329
01:03:35,829 --> 01:03:39,880
project and sample<font color="#E5E5E5"> javascript to keep</font>

1330
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:41,379
people from shooting themselves in the

1331
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:44,140
foot yeah but that what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would like to</font>

1332
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:46,900
to do what I mean is first we<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss</font>

1333
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:48,339
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> need with all the pros and cons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1334
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:50,890
then if we decide to move that forward

1335
01:03:48,339 --> 01:03:52,450
then let's have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a draft on post message</font>

1336
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:54,160
that's what I'm propose we already have

1337
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:55,269
a draft on post message in the working

1338
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:59,069
group it's just that people aren't

1339
01:03:55,269 --> 01:04:01,990
working on and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are running circles</font>

1340
01:03:59,069 --> 01:04:06,190
yeah didn't we<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought you adopted</font>

1341
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:08,799
that ah no be we never<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we had one</font>

1342
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:10,779
document also in the open ID foundation

1343
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:12,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">we never got anywhere and but we ran</font>

1344
01:04:10,779 --> 01:04:15,759
over time already we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> push that</font>

1345
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:20,019
is that true I'm are we finished<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font>

1346
01:04:15,759 --> 01:04:24,999

1347
01:04:20,019 --> 01:04:28,238
song sorry quick get some drinks before

1348
01:04:24,999 --> 01:04:31,089

1353
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:07,200

1354
