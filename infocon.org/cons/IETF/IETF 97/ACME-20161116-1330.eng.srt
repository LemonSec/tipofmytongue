we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for somebody to make a</font>

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:37,239
series of memes to capture the meeting

7
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,879
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could be pecha kucha style you</font>

8
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:42,640
can have a words on them and if you'd

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,360
the person who creates the series of

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:52,360
memes pls put up your hand it means

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,449
minutes so so I I could do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if I got</font>

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,860
a replacement javis<font color="#E5E5E5"> carb</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok uh you want</font>

14
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:59,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take over okay we've got a</font>

15
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,690
replacement jabber scrub and your to

16
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,089
capture the meeting in a series of means

17
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,370
and we will put this into the official

18
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:08,470
minutes if the memes are an accurate

19
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,690
portrayal of the meeting as as it goes

20
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,940
forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> gives you a skype doesn't have</font>

21
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:14,170
at it that if calls doesn't it well let

22
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,120
me put it to you this way it will be up

23
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:20,070
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the consensus of the working group as</font>

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:23,979
to whether or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it an accurate capture</font>

25
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:27,070
yes cheers job consensus will post a

26
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:29,800
minute but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll we'll post a Nima's to</font>

27
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,869
the to the word mailing list and people

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,390
can propose amendments to the means if

29
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:38,380
needed but<font color="#CCCCCC"> since we are confident that</font>

30
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:43,210
Martin understands Acme in a deep and

31
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:45,220
meaningful way and understands memes yes

32
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,289
definitely that um we believe that we

33
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,920
will get an accurate series of memes out

34
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,920
of it thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mark</font>

less productive than we thought during

66
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,660
the first phase of the cycle but during

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,790
the end of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the deadline</font>

68
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,980
approaching Jacob and I got on slack and

69
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,350
had some<font color="#E5E5E5"> real time discussion and got</font>

70
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,750
some issues hammered out where we had

71
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:55,220
pretty much agreement<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the list but he</font>

72
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,870
and I disagreed on some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agreement</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and got some things landed</font>

so highlights are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> next few slides</font>

00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:04,330
lots of typos and clarifications varying

00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,190
in seriousness from spelling too

80
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,459
side to kind of

81
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,019
make the protocol more

82
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">developer-friendly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like historically we</font>

83
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:22,108
had presented the certificates that were

84
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,930
issued<font color="#CCCCCC"> as in der binary is in one format</font>

85

<font color="#CCCCCC">uh Joe and just the end entity</font>

86
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,169
certificate when in reality what you

87
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,630
need to consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> web</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server most the</font>

88
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:32,789
time is a pem formatted thing that has

89
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:36,360
the whole chain of certificates back to

90
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:37,409
a trust anchor and so because that was

91
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,840
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the developers were going to need</font>

92
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,660
anyway we figured why not just provide

93
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,340
that in the protocol um it's a little in

94
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,110
some ways it's suboptimal because of

95
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,479
course the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki being the complex</font>

96
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,780
beautiful beast it is there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not one</font>

97
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">true trust chain back to back to one</font>

98
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,369
trust anchor for any given an intensity

99
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,010
cert and so we still have the links in

100
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,600
there that rely that clients can use to

101
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:03,240
build alternative chains if they want to

102
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know find other cas and use other</font>

103
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:10,080
routes but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea was by defaults to</font>

104
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,780
have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ca recommend one and do some of</font>

105
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,530
that logic about will this chain be

106
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,520
accepted broadly in on behalf<font color="#E5E5E5"> of clients</font>

107
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,919
we added some<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff around except</font>

108
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,380
language and some clarity around how the

109
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,539
server should handle contacts it doesn't

110
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,729
life next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> please terms of service</font>

111
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:30,180
there was a bunch of back and forth on

112
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:33,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">the list about this um basically we</font>

113
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,550
wanted to optimize for the case the

114
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,960
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> that arises is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> client</font>

115
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,150
agrees to some terms of service when it

116
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,388
signs up with acne when it registers its

117
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:45,270
account but over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the course of time as</font>

118
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:46,770
the that account exists for weeks or

119
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,840
months or years the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CA may have to</font>

120
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,599
change<font color="#CCCCCC"> its terms of service I may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

121
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,810
to update it and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is what</font>

122
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:57,389
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the CA does that um in</font>

123
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,639
practice CH do this fairly frequently

124
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:01,260
and they generally structure their terms

125
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,479
of service so that the client doesn't

126
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,690
have to really does have to re express

127
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,460
its agreement when the terms change um

128
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,560
but we wanted to accommodate the case

129
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,430
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is possible in principle</font>

130
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,139
that one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes might require</font>

131
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,300
clients to re-express their agreement if

132
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,880
there's some really huge material change

133
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,320
that wasn't predicted in advance and so

134
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,450
what we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we've made a change</font>

135
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,789
that really optimizes pretty heavily for

136
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,430
that former case so the only in band

137
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:29,110
provision

138
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,930
you know the provision in the protocol

139
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,580
itself is for that initial agreement<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

140
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,790
terms so the only time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can agree to</font>

141
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:39,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms is when you establish your account</font>

142
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:41,920
if there's a need for re agreement down

143
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,960
the line there's not a way to do that in

144
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,820
the protocol but we have an error code

145
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,010
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server can use to say you know</font>

146
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:51,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">put the brakes on you know you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

147
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:54,370
perceive unless you agree to these terms

148
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,800
and in the error document the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font>

149
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:59,260
presents it can provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a link</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they send</font>

150
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,330

151
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,849
need to explicitly break automation at

152
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,229
this point um the concern overall is

153
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,480
breaking automation for the Sri

154
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:10,450

157
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:18,700
agreement is really necessary but in

158
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,620
general um we assume that you know the

159
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:24,159
legal documents have been structured so

160
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,930

165
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,909
mean it like the whole notion that the

user agreed to determine the servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

167
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:46,060
the first place is completely specious

168
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,229
right and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciate it the legal</font>

169
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:51,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">fiction but I'm just saying like so like</font>

170
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:53,440
is this chart is this construction

171
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,620
interests away that I can't simply

172
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,880
reregister the light<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no way</font>

173
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,590
for the client to pretend that he

174
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:04,659
presented to give these are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of</font>

00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking for some like captcha here to</font>

177
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,510
verify that a human touch the no I'm

178
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">asking I'm asking is the protocol is</font>

179
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:15,760
charged in such a way that the steps to

180
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,770
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps to which the crime would have</font>

181
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,830
to do have to have to go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

182
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:23,680
pretend that these are looked at it are

183
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:25,090
obvious so is it for instance to go to

184
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,920
some link and the directions for you to

185
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,900
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> or in that link and then the and then</font>

186
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,960
that like basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't you can't</font>

187
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,780
complete yes so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> initial um the</font>

188
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,299
initial agreement oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> um yeah Jacob you</font>

189
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:39,870
want to chime in from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Q yeah so where</font>

190
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:43,890
I'm fundamentally a similarly

191
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:46,350
please call crime here that number three

192
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,939
mmm but we're assuming the client

193
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,290
doesn't cheat because the client is

194
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:54,540
supposed to be acting in the use of

195
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:57,120
interest it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other what I thought</font>

196
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,189
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> question was is the error code</font>

197
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,050
sticky like you'll keep getting that

198
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,520
same our back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you keep getting that</font>

199
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,349
same our back from the server until

200
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,420
you've actually or some other related

201
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the thing that makes it harder to do</font>

202
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,579
yeah right yeah so that's that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

203
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:13,890
intent<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you know say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have one</font>

204
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,390
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these hard requirement for Rhea</font>

205
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,490
greement you would keep getting this

206
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:20,460
error until you actually do whatever the

207
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,900
server wants you to do because

208
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,029
ultimately up to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server's policy</font>

209
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,770
when it wants to prevent the present

210
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:28,140
this error in the first place and so

211
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,579
it's a service policy you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how how</font>

212
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,020
much of a pain it wants to be about

213
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,580
forcing some of their do this agreement

214
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I might be the server would let you</font>

215
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,100
do some fiddly things but not issue

216
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,410
certificates might let you do

217
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,370
authorizations but now certificates and

218
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,890
then when you go to issue a certificate

219
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,120
I'll throw this error up um I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

220
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's much for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> straps to say</font>

221
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:48,980
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because it's ultimately up to</font>

222
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,420
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CA how much 15 ian wants to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

223
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:54,230
this Christmas fairly silly but not

224
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:56,339
everybody gonna batter<font color="#E5E5E5"> breath I mean</font>

225
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,770
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> be honest all of this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agreement</font>

226
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,480
stuff is kind of silly but it's you know

227
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:02,459
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CAS are feeling they have</font>

228
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,529
to have in order to comply with the VRS

229
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:06,119
and so I understand we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to play</font>

230
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:08,970
like minimal mechanics they need to be

231
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,260
in compliance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to feel as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a to convince</font>

232

whatever lawyers involved with<font color="#E5E5E5"> their in</font>

233
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">compliance right but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean you don't</font>

234
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">need an error occurred you don't need a</font>

235
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,640
specific error code for this you could

236
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,589
just what you need is an error code that

237
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,080
says something is going wrong go to this

238
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:23,490
URL and deal with it as a generic

239
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,140
fashion that<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

240
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,010
special Eric<font color="#E5E5E5"> oppas particular case for</font>

241
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,880
something is growing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to go to a</font>

242
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,900
URL sure um I mean I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> my point is</font>

243
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,790
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had a perfectly a</font>

244
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,230
mechanism which was I<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to agree</font>

245
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to whatever new terms you decide to</font>

246
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,440
impose on me I hate without actually

247
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:40,620
looking at them which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

248
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,420
reasonable and what so would your

249
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,580
concern go away if instead of agreement

250
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,860
required the word was action required I

251
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:49,910
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be less specious but</font>

252
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,910
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not like how much</font>

253
00:10:52,329 --> 00:11:02,049
I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like it as it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is but I've not</font>

254
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:03,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">heard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over on this yeah I mean I guess</font>

255
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:07,170
you can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could upload I could see</font>

256
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:09,879
being generically useful to have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

257
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:12,910
general break automation and send a user

258
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:16,420
to this so so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question I have Becker</font>

259
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:19,629
is if it's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very specific it</font>

260
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:22,988
says<font color="#E5E5E5"> please go to the URL that's in the</font>

261
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:24,279
directory if it's something more generic

262
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:26,889
that's actually not the case like if you

263
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:29,860
look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> speck um it says go to the</font>

264
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:31,239
URL it's any problem document<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah visit</font>

265
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,470
this one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem yeah so you</font>

266
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:35,920
really could just change the error code

267
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:38,410
yeah okay I'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine with that my</font>

268
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,149
question is going to be when um when for

269
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:43,029
instance you discover that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user on</font>

270
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:45,790
these email address no longer works what

271
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:46,929
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do that and so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

272
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:50,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">there a whole class of things that</font>

273
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:52,089
basically involve ah<font color="#E5E5E5"> automation is</font>

274
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:53,889
broken I mean uh purpose for having

275
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:57,100
these mechanical or error codes is to

276
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:58,299
find using useful with them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> UJ + u %</font>

277
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,459
we started this the client can't get any

278
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:07,600
useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and any objection to changes</font>

279
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:08,919
to client as a user action required all

280
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,329
right I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I'll do that then because</font>

281
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:13,540
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's probably a little bit</font>

282
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:18,008
more useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um I hope meme taker</font>

283
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:19,449
you got that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that seems seems</font>

284
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:22,809
like user action required has a good

285
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:25,899
name<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming with it all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> third</font>

286
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:27,429
service key<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll over um there was a</font>

287
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:29,649
bunch we had some discussion on this

288
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:31,089
last IETF meeting and very vague terms

289
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,429
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they got more concrete on the list</font>

290
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:37,869
and kicked around a bunch of options

291
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:39,129
next slide net of those PRS we have more

292
00:12:37,869 --> 00:12:41,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">or less</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of structure we discussed last</font>

293
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:44,290
time where we have nested signatures

294
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:46,149
where the old key when you bring your

295
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,829
transit so this the use case here is

296
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:49,929
we're transitioning from an old account

297
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:52,029
key to a new account key for existence

298
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:56,019
you know we're worried about you know

299
00:12:52,029 --> 00:13:00,490
just keeping fresh keyz so the old key

300
00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:01,600
signs the the overall payload which<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

301
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">is not kind of nice because it preserves</font>

302
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,439
the invariant that the outer signature

303
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:06,240
on a payload sense the server is always

304
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:08,579
an

305
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,680
sing account you don't have a new thing

306
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,540
new key to ending this so yeah we have

307
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,729
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be it's always an old</font>

308
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:19,260
key the old key signs did the payload

309
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:21,720
inside of that would think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it signs is a</font>

310
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,880
signature by the new key<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a</font>

311
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,510
statement that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should change from</font>

312
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,490
the old key to the new key so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

313
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:31,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was basically what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Karthik's</font>

314
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,600
analysis over the summer pointed us

315
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,180
toward and well basically what we

316
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,890
discussed on this may be slightly out of

317
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,829
this may need a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of an update</font>

318
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:42,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">because since we change to represent</font>

319
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:47,279
keys by reference but it's this is the

320
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:50,459
idea next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> please yeah so a couple</font>

321
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,380
of bigger things after echo suggesting

322
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:54,859
the last IETF meeting in noting that the

323
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:58,050
new new application how new order flow

324
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,970
lost this<font color="#CCCCCC"> pre-authorization thing lost</font>

325
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,459
some important use cases we agree added

326
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,570
that as Jacob<font color="#E5E5E5"> pointed out on the list</font>

327
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:06,000
there are some compatibility

328
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:08,810
implications to this when you consider

329
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,640
the existing acne client base that is

330
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:15,180
connecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a let's encrypt so existing</font>

331
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:17,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">acne clients supporting earlier versions</font>

332
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,689
of the protocol are only using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new</font>

333
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,689
authorization flow they're not using a

334
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:23,730
new order flow and so leaving<font color="#E5E5E5"> these both</font>

335
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25,560
around might mean that their clients

336
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:28,770
around that don't support all of the

337
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,239
spec um I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the I</font>

338
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,890
think it's ultimately not a blocker but

339
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,320
something we should keep an eye on as

340
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,579
we're developing the client base for it

341
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">and starting to do some implementation</font>

342
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:40,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">interop there was some concern we have</font>

343
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">these not these anti replay announces</font>

344
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,100

<font color="#CCCCCC">four iteration of this the way you got</font>

00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:50,430
them was in headers on every random um

347

responses can be casual Daniel do can

356
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:14,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">you remind me what the issue was there</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">anyway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> catchability</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issues and so now we</font>

358
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,720
have but when a client shows up<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

359
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,160
fresh it doesn't have any<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-state it</font>

360
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,199
can go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this new non send point</font>

361
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,839
I to get a fresh nods instead of just

00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:27,508
hitting some random<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint to get an</font>

363
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,129
ounce so simplifies things a little

364
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:32,100
there makes cat makes the protocol more

365
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:35,420
caching friendly and hopefully more

366
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:39,149
scalable um proactive<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ritzer issuances</font>

367
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,560
pretty minor thing and then one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

368
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:42,990
things we had some debate about enlist

369
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:47,689
again was whether we specify account

370
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:50,610
keys on the jws signatures<font color="#CCCCCC"> and quests by</font>

371
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:53,879
putting the key the<font color="#CCCCCC"> client's account</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key</font>

372
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:56,610
itself in the jws or by putting the URL

373
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:59,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clients account in there and the</font>

374
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:00,990
trade-off here is as follows so if you

375
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:03,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">put the key in there you're relying on</font>

376
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:05,759
the server to compare that<font color="#E5E5E5"> key</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

377
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:08,610
key it's got stored for an account in

378
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,379
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in its account database and if you</font>

379
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:13,259
put the URL there you're trusting the

380
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:18,930
server to look up the key and so not

381
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:20,399
screw up its URL comparison so risk

382
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,199
why's your kind of balancing those to

383
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,600
risk the risk you<font color="#CCCCCC"> squeaky comparison</font>

384
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:28,949
versus a risky script a URL mangling

385
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,209
thing on that balance I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

386
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:32,880
had any consensus around which was more

387
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:34,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">likely they both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed like both pretty</font>

388
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,009
remote because<font color="#E5E5E5"> people do these things</font>

389
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,689
regularly all the time um Jacob I think

390
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:42,389
preferred the especially preferred the

391
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:44,490
key lookup thing because that means that

392
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:46,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">the server has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have identified</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

393
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,060
account that this key it belongs to

394
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:50,370
before it does any further processing

395
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,719
whereas you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do some</font>

396
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,670
processing if you've got the key in hand

397
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,139
without it knowing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it belongs to an</font>

398
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:59,219
account so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more</font>

399
00:16:55,139 --> 00:17:01,740
conservative in that way so any comments

400
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,939
on those state of the art all right I

401
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,120
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last of the things we</font>

402
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:07,889
did alright so now you can tune in and

403
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,899
put your discussion hats on a couple

404
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,909
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are still open I wanted to</font>

405
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:15,030
get feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> on see if we can bring some</font>

406
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:17,220
conclusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and uh close now next</font>

407
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:21,030
slide please so a couple of issues

408
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:23,159
opened we have an issue and a PR and

409
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:28,049
some discussion on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your list about this</font>

410
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:29,760
topic um the issue is um if you're

411
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:32,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about taking a CA it's been in</font>

412
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,140
business for a while or CA that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has you</font>

413
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,810
know non acne thing

414
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:39,870
going on it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a customer</font>

415
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:43,350
database that is not in acne it's not

416
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:45,449
just the you know keep air and contact

417
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,560
information that acne negotiates so you

418
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,910
might have some additional

419
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,820
authorizations tied to that

420
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,930
authorizations the issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> EV say or you</font>

421
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,189
might have some richer customer

422
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,140
information and policy information

423
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,330
associated with that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you might</font>

424
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,360
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tie your customer account</font>

425
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:02,760
database that existed before acne or

426
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,770
beside acne an associate an account

427
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,110
there with an account in acne you know

428
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:10,590
an account<font color="#E5E5E5"> key pair in the acne except</font>

429
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:12,240
context and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's a desire for some</font>

430
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,399
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to associate you know to take one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,500
these and associate it<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the other so</font>

432
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,480
we have a PR right now that takes an

433
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,640
idea that some start come guys proposed

434
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,440
and writes it in the idea is when you

435
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,920
you make your new registration<font color="#E5E5E5"> your new</font>

436
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,990
account in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new parlance in in your</font>

437
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,580
payload there you include and its

438
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,950
external secret the idea is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

439
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:35,730
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an API key or a binder</font>

440
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:37,920
that the CA is handed you say when you

441
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:42,060
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and register correctly use this to</font>

442
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:45,120
indicate that this is your account so

443
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:50,399
kind of typical API key bearer token

444
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:52,260
sort of semantics the one thing I'm

445
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,790
wondering here this seems at one level

446
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,900
very straight for the one thing I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

447
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,220
thing I'm wondering here is whether we

448
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">should write maybe some security</font>

449
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,750
considerations to kind of recommends

450
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:03,030
that we get authorization in both

451
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,370
directions so taking the API key from

452
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:09,840
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> system and putting it into</font>

453
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:12,330
acne gives you your kind of enables acne

454
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,830
to claim an existing thing I wonder if

455
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,780
it would also be useful to recommend

456
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,220
that CA is doing this also<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to the</font>

457
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">other other direction and have someone</font>

458
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,990
take their acne key and provision it up

459
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,170
into their<font color="#E5E5E5"> account so that the two can</font>

460
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,880
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> matched up bidirectionally again I</font>

461
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,830
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> done a lot of analysis and</font>

462
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,530
thinking about what the risks are here

463
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,090
but it seems like in other protocol

464
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">context where we haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had that kind</font>

465
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,169
of bidirectional authorization we've had

466
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:40,110
unknown keisha risks again I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

467
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:42,660
totally sure how that that shows up that

468
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">might show up here but might be</font>

469
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,470
something conservative trick<font color="#CCCCCC"> then people</font>

470
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:49,210
consider cas in the rooms this scene

471
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,320
sufficient for what you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

472
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:53,520
imagining in terms of account

473
00:19:50,320 --> 00:20:03,220
management's where's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my digits</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ER</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy</font>

474
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:06,370
yeah what do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think so glum Wilson</font>

475
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:09,940
yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really does fit the the needs</font>

476
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:11,830
that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for at least as long</font>

477
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,809
as we can you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> specify some external</font>

478
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,260
secret we should be able to make that

479
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:23,408
association between a<font color="#CCCCCC"> current-account</font>

480
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:24,940
objects and the ID acne ID<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok yeah ok</font>

481
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:26,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">any thoughts on the security</font>

482
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,620
considerations here whether it's like

483
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:33,010
super important to recommend

484
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:34,719
authorization<font color="#CCCCCC"> really adores like do you</font>

485
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,039
guys have people if you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> building</font>

486
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,650
system like this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a field</font>

487
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:40,510
where someone can drop their acne key in

488
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:43,030
yeah and that's kind of what we've been

489
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:45,190
moving towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> as having within their</font>

490
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:48,250
account somewhere that they can specify

491
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,840
their acne key you know specific to

492
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:53,320
their cap so they can they can make that

493
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:57,129
proactively or within the acne bridge

494
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,020
new reg a call they can they can specify

495
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,970
an external secret to link it there

496
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:04,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">think as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well so you see you've got kind</font>

497
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:06,940
of both directions either or it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

498
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:11,710
required to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do both no not currently fit</font>

499
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:14,169
Martin yeah so mum Thompson if you're

500
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:17,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">asking someone to bind an acne account</font>

501
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:18,640
key into existing systems you're going

502
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,429
to want to prove to those existing

503
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,820
systems that you hold the private key

504
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:27,880
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yeah good point and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means</font>

505
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:31,240
then you probably need some advice on

506
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:34,530
what to sign because we don't want

507
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:37,809
people creating themselves cross-domain

508
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:39,850
confusion in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tax lansing yes so just</font>

509
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:43,570
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit of advice here's a</font>

510
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:44,678
suggestion make it a jws like the rest

511
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:48,939
of acne is and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just put something</font>

512
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:53,289
different in the field there's a

513
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:55,150
recommendation that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ack is just</font>

514
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:58,629
leaving is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of thing yeah so</font>

515
00:21:55,150 --> 00:22:00,100
Martin they might try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like put our</font>

516
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,270
heads together and see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

517
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,850
up with soon security can see

518
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:08,170
I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to avoid defining a whole</font>

519
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:10,570
new thing for this right so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

520
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:13,060
same problem in push where we have an

521
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,800
external system at Mozilla that we use

522
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,300
for the same sort of thing so I've got

523
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,399
some experience there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay great so</font>

524
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:26,470
let's luck after so<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I'll</font>

525
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:28,090
proceed on that that route<font color="#CCCCCC"> of rich yeah</font>

526
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:32,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">rich rich Saul's in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the back my</font>

527
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:33,520
individual um it's an API key and I

528
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:36,970
think just the security considerations

529
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:39,850
of you know applications you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

530
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:41,770
certain it enterprises using this

531
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:44,560
retreat as securely as any other use of

532
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:46,270
the API key and that's really all you

533
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:51,190
have to say then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's mostly importantly</font>

534
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:53,650
unsupportable<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right good so it</font>

535
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:57,070
sounds like protocol wise at least in

536
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:58,840
terms of the new reg thing we can argue

537
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,210
with Jacob about what exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should</font>

538
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,820
call<font color="#CCCCCC"> the field that will put a field in</font>

539
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:05,140
its that's an opaque thing where you can

540
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,580
put whatever the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CIA gave you and we</font>

541
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,350
won't say anything further about what

542
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,370
the structure is and then i'll talk with

543
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,050
martin about what we should put in

544
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:13,899
security considerations<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right great</font>

545
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:16,360
thanks next slide please um the other

546
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:19,240
requests we got from CA<font color="#CCCCCC"> from interests</font>

547
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:22,149
was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have some way to provide</font>

548
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:25,060
more information on if you think about a

549
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:27,100
lot of existing CA plus which<font color="#E5E5E5"> which I am</font>

550
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,690
NOT deeply familiar but I believe when

551
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,120
you sign up as a customer with these

552
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:33,820
organizations you provide a whole bunch

553
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can provide context</font>

554
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:38,070
of information some organizational

555
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,600
information things like that and so um

556
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:43,990
cas might want to be able to request

557
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:47,980
that clients when they show up provide

558
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:50,080
some additional information and so the

559
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:53,080
question is like do we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> reflect</font>

560
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,240
this stuff in acne um you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

561
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,220
imagine having sort of and out of damn

562
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,420
thing a user action required please go

563
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,010
to this web page and fill in the

564
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,500
additional stuff before I'll accept your

565
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:05,350
registration now that we have that

566
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,180
mechanism thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eckhart you can imagine</font>

567
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:09,730
have some sort of external pop out there

568
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:12,460
um you can imagine doing something like

569
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:15,760
um was proposed in the email thread of

570
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:17,470
having a designated CA extension

571
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,440
zone where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can put these additional</font>

572
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:23,110
fields or you can imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> just shoving</font>

573
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:26,260
them in at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top level so that's all</font>

574
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:28,030
about kind of how the ca would how the

575
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,980
client would provide that stuff up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

576
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:31,960
the CA in its<font color="#E5E5E5"> new registration request</font>

577
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,160
there's also the question of doing it

578
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,520
whether we need a way for the ca to

579
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,050
prompt<font color="#E5E5E5"> the clients to say yes you sent</font>

580
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,639
me this but no I really need more

581
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:42,270
information I need you to provide these

582
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,560
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> following non-standard fields</font>

583
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:46,000
there's I guess some question about how

584
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,480
you deal with the non-standard feel that

585
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,080
your clients but not sure they're um any

586
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:56,620
thoughts about what to do here um I

587
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,600
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh Martin are you gonna get up and</font>

588
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,310
always forget those if you'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

589
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:05,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> line yes I your thoughts here as well</font>

590
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:07,000
I done this is this is just another form

591
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:09,540
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> X dash thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we keep talking</font>

592
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,550
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> i always forget the name of the IC</font>

593
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:14,530
this is bucket of things that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

594
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:16,300
throw some stuff in that might end up

595
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:17,860
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful for some people if it's</font>

596
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,090
useful for<font color="#E5E5E5"> some people then it's</font>

597
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,179
probably going to be useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> for other</font>

598
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:23,500
people i suspect i mean the previous

599
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:26,020
field is a great example of that sort of

600
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,430
thing we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all CA is going to be</font>

601
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,860
doing these sorts of things but there's

602
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:32,140
a bunch of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lid that do and you can</font>

603
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,820
imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if if let's encrypt have</font>

604
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,020
gone out with the protocol that didn't

605
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,010
have this field you'd end up with a

606
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:40,750
request to put it in this bucket

607
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:46,060
accepted wisdom here is that we define

608
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:47,860
the fields in the freeform text fields

609
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:50,320
that we already have there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> plenty of</font>

610
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:52,449
space and if they turn out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be useful</font>

611
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,850
then you talk about standardization at

612
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,040
that point yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

613
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's any particular need for a</font>

614
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,290
special bucket now the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

615
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:05,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do with fields that may be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needed</font>

616
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:07,659
by particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> cas and and would be</font>

617
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,699
required of proprietary extensions that

618
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:13,360
become sort of critical to the

619
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:16,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">processing of a request that's a special</font>

620
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,459
problem that<font color="#CCCCCC"> cas create for themselves</font>

621
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure that we necessarily</font>

622
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,720
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> concern ourselves with in the</font>

623
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,889
protocol right right here we do have

624
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,360
protection against someone who wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

625
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,920
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the semantics of the</font>

626
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">protocol pneus that's in the versioning</font>

627
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,780
fields and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that's</font>

628
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,460
perfectly sufficient so if i could

629
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:36,760
summarized at least the protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

630
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:39,280
aspects but i think the X<font color="#E5E5E5"> dash the X</font>

631
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,020
dash thing is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good analogy for</font>

632
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,570
those who have not been<font color="#CCCCCC"> following it</font>

633
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,490
used to be that in HTTP if<font color="#CCCCCC"> your if you</font>

634
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:48,310
had an experimental header you<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefixed</font>

635
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:50,920
it with X<font color="#E5E5E5"> dash and the problem was that</font>

636
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:52,450
thing's<font color="#E5E5E5"> escape from being experiments</font>

637
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,330
and became standard usage and so you

638
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:56,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">have these things that were now</font>

639
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:59,679
practically standard you may have seen

640
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,940
like x-forwarded-for by name and

641
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,680
experimental header but now everyone

642
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,360
just uses it and so rather than having

643
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">to rename things that became standard</font>

644
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:09,370
good the current guidance is don't

645
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:11,110
bother with<font color="#E5E5E5"> X dash to start with and so</font>

646
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:13,979
the correspondence here is don't if

647
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:16,389
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you might add say</font>

648
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:19,090
organizational unit field to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new reg</font>

649
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:20,560
in this in this extension bucket

650
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,060
shouldn't bother tagging it as an

651
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:24,820
extension you should just go ahead and

652
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,320
toss it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the top level and if it gets</font>

653
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:29,159
useful and will standardize it at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

654
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,810
top level if not it'll go away Declan

655
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,120
clin Wilson I actually agree with with

656
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:37,020
Martin here a great deal I feel like

657
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:41,199
it's just having some kind of general

658
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:43,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">top-level list is the most flexible</font>

659
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,300
solution and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need to have</font>

660
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:49,420
something specific we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like we</font>

661
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:53,590
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get by without this at all but it</font>

662
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:55,540
would absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very useful and I'm</font>

663
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:59,139
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just in the top level tickets</font>

664
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:03,580
use standardized it is along with our

665
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:04,960
thinking is so yeah we should maybe

666
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,310
think a little bit about what the

667
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,020
extensibility story looks like you're

668
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,090
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how a registry for the</font>

669
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:13,210
standardized field so tell people not to

670
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:14,919
conflict with what yeah someone tells it

671
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:17,350
I I think you have a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

672
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,300
strategies available to you here one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

673
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:21,280
don't say anything in sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of rely on</font>

674
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,960
Jason semantics and people doing what

675
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,310
they do that's on the antics and host

676
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,010
your fingers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and hold your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> breath</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

677
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:30,870
maybe maybe you'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the other one</font>

678
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:33,300
is to define a de final registry and

679
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:38,110
lower the bar make it really easy to

680
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:39,310
register things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there and i would</font>

681
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:41,770
suggest something like specification

682
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:43,000
required and just put all the existing

683
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:45,790
ones that you have

684
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,290
in there now do you have multiple

685
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,570
registries that's probably something

686
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:51,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font>

687
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,439
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's not gonna be</font>

688
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:56,470
particularly<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

689
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">just want to say no i don't know i think</font>

690
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:03,910
about it myself but it seems pretty

691
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:06,340
straightforward and this is dkg<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font>

692
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:08,290
been 30 in these comments in particular

693
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,030
just want to highlight that the reason

694
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:11,110
the one risk that you have of putting

695
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:13,420
everything at the top level is a

696
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:15,040
coordination risk right where<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

697
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,590
organizations start using the same name

698
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,190
for two different purposes and so the

699
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,679
more that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can facilitate</font>

700
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:22,990
coordination the better and a registry

701
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,220
is a reasonable way to do that so just

702
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:26,020
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that note that you don't</font>

703
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,150
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to folks using the same label for</font>

704
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:29,230
across purposes especially if it's a

705
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:31,200
registry with really low bar for

706
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,920
registering stuff exactly and

707
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,900
specification required just<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

708
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:39,640
documented in the language that people

709
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:41,830
can read<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Martin to be</font>

710
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,090
the expert<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I'm happy to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

711
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:45,189
expert for that one because it requires

712
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:48,129
you might include the instructions<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

713
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:50,410
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> expert saying specification exists</font>

714
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:52,600
and you can read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it yeah don't be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

715
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:58,320
it might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in crayon but that'll be</font>

716
00:29:52,600 --> 00:30:01,139
fine echo<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not first composite</font>

717
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,460
that might be that might be okay as well

718
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,530
yeah they generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> generally speaking I</font>

719
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:07,270
like I prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> the specification required</font>

720
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,710
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it makes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it people like to</font>

00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:11,350
think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it is the semantics of</font>

722
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:14,020
the thing it isn't and write it down so

723
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:16,840
that others can it provide some back

724
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:20,920
pressure for duplication yeah gratuitous

725
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:23,530
duplication yeah all right great next

726
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:26,620
slide please so this one went a few

727
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:28,240
rounds on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mailing list about</font>

728
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:30,669
requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> and authorizations and kind</font>

729
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,870
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the object model we have here Thank</font>

730
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:34,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">You Daniel for sitting me down last</font>

731
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:36,580
night we kind of like draw droughts and

732
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:39,460
diagrams and figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what the what</font>

733
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:41,199
the proposals should go forward so send

734
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:44,740
us out in text on the list last night

735
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,750
but we'll go through it here kind of

736
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,400
coming at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this with two goals I think</font>

737
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:51,100
Jacobs initial proposal which is in the

738
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:53,980
poor request is to try and deduplicate

739
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:56,260
status fields between the order object

740
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:58,270
and the authorization object and

741
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:01,180
remove unnecessary levels of abstraction

742
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:02,650
so right now we've got basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

743
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,360
three levels<font color="#E5E5E5"> of abstraction we've got an</font>

744
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:05,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">order which has requirements</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and one of</font>

745
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,600
those requirements is an authorization

746
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:09,040
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need this requirements</font>

747
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,919
level of abstraction or can we just have

748
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:14,170
orders directly having authorizations so

749
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:17,020
proposal i'll talk about in detail on

750
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:18,760
the subsequent slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> um it's basically</font>

751
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,470
erase this requirements of abstraction

752
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,140
and in particular one thing that would

753
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:25,030
do is remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> the out-of-band requirement</font>

754
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:28,150
which is the only non authorization

755
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:29,740
requirement we had then once you've

756
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:31,900
removed that you take instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of having</font>

757
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,550
a requirements array in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the order you</font>

758
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,900
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> say here are the authorizations you</font>

759
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,820
have to go get and don't say anything

760
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">further about whatever the cert of</font>

761
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:40,810
whatever the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CA would require to get a</font>

762
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:43,180
cert next slide so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the</font>

763
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:44,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">old semantic model or old on I say</font>

764
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:48,250
currents that's in the draft right now

765
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:50,140
um so we have kind of two clusters here

766
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:52,210
you know an order is a request to get a

767
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:53,200
certificate and the requirements tell

768
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,270
you what you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to get that</font>

769
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">certificate so that's kind of one</font>

770
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,950
cluster an authorization is a request<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

771
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,449
get an identifier and the challenges

772
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,760
tell you what you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do to be able</font>

773
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:06,700
to represent<font color="#E5E5E5"> that identifier so we kind</font>

774
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,530
of duplicated that structure in these

775
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:13,060
two places for these two targets

776
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:14,860
certificates and identifiers and then we

777
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:16,840
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of link them together by saying one</font>

778
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,550
type of requirement you might make<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

779
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,199
get a certificate is you have to get

780
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:22,330
authorization for the identifiers in the

781
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,620
certificate and we made that distinction

782
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:26,199
so that we could also have this

783
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:28,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">out-of-band requirement so in order to</font>

784
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,590
get the certificate you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> prove</font>

785
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,180
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you own all the identifiers in it</font>

786
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:32,919
you have to get authorization then you

787
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:36,940
also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a user load this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> URL</font>

788
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:39,370
and you know pass a<font color="#CCCCCC"> CAPTCHA or submit a</font>

789
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:42,850
credit card or you know enter their

790
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:46,870
favorite color or whatever with the idea

791
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:49,090
that you know CAS have all sorts of

792
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:51,699
processes leading up to issuance and we

793
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:53,649
should have some affordance for patching

794
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:56,620
those processes in beyond just the

795
00:32:53,650 --> 00:33:00,580
authorization process for proving

796
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:02,649
identifiers<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so next slide the</font>

797
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:05,860
proposal here is to scratch those

798
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:09,460
through um just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have orders directly</font>

799
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:10,389
refer to authorizations you know no

800
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">change in the bottom</font>

801
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:13,840
right hand corner but remove this level

802
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:17,140
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> abstraction remove the out-of-band</font>

803
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,000
capability and just have just have the

804
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,800
protocol talk about what authorizations

805
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,580
the client has to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> before the CA is</font>

806
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:27,129
willing to issue next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide here's how</font>

807
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:28,480
it shows up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the order objects now</font>

808
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,520
before you had requirements one of those

809
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,400
authorizations one of them's<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of band</font>

810
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:35,290
on this also shows one thing we could do

811
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,150
if we really want to deduplicate status

812
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:38,800
fields is just in line the authorization

813
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:42,880
ins the order object as opposed to refer

814
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:44,470
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it by reference</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm left</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm totally</font>

815
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">in Finland and Jacob said we shouldn't</font>

816
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:49,240
and I'm fine with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so yeah that's</font>

817
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,790
that's what the proposal looks like so

818
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:55,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">it kind of compacts down the semantic</font>

819
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:59,100
model a little bit um you know saves<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

820
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:01,060
guess some server logic and you know

821
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:03,040
streamlines the capability model a

822
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:04,750
little bit so I guess the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

823
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,889
is does is there anyone here that feels

824
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,690
the out-of-band stuff is really

825
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:10,419
necessary or that we really need this

826
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:12,760
generic requirements thing so obviously

827
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:14,500
what we can do I mean if we decide we

828
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,899
need some if we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see a to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

829
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,940
to specify some other requirements in

830
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:20,350
the future you can add stuff to this

831
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,909
order object and say in addition to

832
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,860
doing these authorizations you also have

833
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:25,300
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and do this other thing you</font>

834
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:28,720
also have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the out-of-band thing</font>

835
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:30,790
etc and so we would just<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would just</font>

836
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:33,489
handle those directly as additions to

837
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:35,080
the order field as opposed to be having

838
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:37,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">some generic container you can define</font>

839
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">them in my some on Thompson I think the</font>

840
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,989
general<font color="#E5E5E5"> structure that you have here is</font>

841
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:43,360
sign I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clarify that the</font>

842
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:46,299
example that you show is the exploded

843
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:49,270
version and you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a non</font>

844
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:53,140
exploded version that is simply what a

845
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:54,850
list of URLs or a list of the things

846
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:57,190
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see on the left because we don't</font>

847
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:59,770
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a type field anymore right uh yeah</font>

848
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:02,310
so so if we do the non exploded version

849
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:04,300
we could just have a list of URLs um

850
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,920
yeah because you don't have much for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

851
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,600
syntax of that that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh well you might</font>

852
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,570
you might actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> a status field</font>

853
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,040
because you know we realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> CAS</font>

854
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:14,830
say what authorizations they're using

855
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">even if they're already fulfilled and so</font>

856
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,770
you might like to say to save the client

857
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:20,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">the work of going off and fetching the</font>

858
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:23,290
ones there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> key valid so I'm not been</font>

859
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,400
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> band disappearing we're</font>

860
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:26,529
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out this do</font>

861
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,010
if you return the requirement that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a</font>

862
00:35:26,529 --> 00:35:32,170
csr no certificate oh that's our I

863
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:34,930
couldn't hear you is yeah I said I'm not

864
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:36,609
been about the band going<font color="#E5E5E5"> away but I'm</font>

865
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:39,069
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to determine if you rich if you</font>

866
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:42,308
read generated the requirement have a

867
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:44,680
csr and already get an authorization no

868
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:47,099
um so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is only addressing</font>

869
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:50,529
the flow where you send in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> csr first</font>

870
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:53,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay okay there's also the flow where</font>

871
00:35:50,529 --> 00:35:54,970
you directly request authorization okay

872
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,859
in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> case the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you get back is</font>

873
00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:00,669
an authorization directly producer

874
00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:02,140
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> there yep alright so this</font>

875
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:03,760
proposals on the list like I guess if

876
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,930
anyone has comments they can chime in

877
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,000
there anyone else in the room have

878
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:08,410
questions about this anyone really sad

879
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,630
about the out-of-band stuff going away

880
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:14,618
i'm looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at clin he's not shaking</font>

881
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:16,180
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> danger of showing up here</font>

882
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:22,180
as a CIA is that you get called on all

883
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:24,430
the time um you two dating um ok so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

884
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,500
I think Jacob and I are more<font color="#E5E5E5"> or less in</font>

885
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:29,348
agreement on this now as editors and we

886
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,450
can go off<font color="#CCCCCC"> and implement this I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

887
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:35,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was last issue except for the bike</font>

888
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:37,180
shed next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide please so yeah this is</font>

889
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:39,299
the proposed change in terminology just

890
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:42,609
came up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> days ago um</font>

891
00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:45,250
Jacob proposed changing applications to

892
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:48,009
orders I<font color="#E5E5E5"> came in zat oh I I have a bike</font>

893
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:50,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">shed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> myself I'm changing registrations</font>

894
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:52,270
as the noun<font color="#E5E5E5"> to accounts and so you would</font>

895
00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:53,440
register an account your<font color="#CCCCCC"> D register an</font>

897
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,029
of doing all those things to your

898
00:36:54,730 --> 00:37:00,099
registration um anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> have opinions</font>

899
00:36:58,029 --> 00:37:05,109
here anyone want to spend some<font color="#E5E5E5"> bike</font>

900
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:06,339
paints on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay hearing no</font>

901
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:07,750
objections here on the list<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

902
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:13,960
we'll just do this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that is</font>

903
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:16,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issue so uh where we go from</font>

904
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,849
here so the chairs have been continually

905
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:22,390
pressuring us to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> done and last call</font>

906
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:25,420
this thing I'm talking to some

907
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:26,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">implementers uh I've gotten the</font>

908
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,450
impression that folks aren't quite

909
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,848
comfortable finalizing the specking

910
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,808
carving it in stone as an RFC right now

911
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:34,150
because we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot of</font>

912
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:35,890
implementation experience we've got a

913
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:37,870
few chunks of it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Boulder we've got a</font>

914
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:39,430
few chunks of it in

915
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:41,109
some implementation I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

916
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:42,700
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some cas that have different</font>

917
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:44,110
parts of it in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think mostly</font>

918
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:46,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">their interoperate with Cirque pot which</font>

919
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:48,340
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a legacy implementation so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

920
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:50,379
what I wanted to propose here is that we

921
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:52,660
do more<font color="#E5E5E5"> or less what TLS is doing right</font>

922
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:54,070
now so they've they've had their having

923
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,960
a working group last call to kind of

924
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:57,370
last call the<font color="#CCCCCC"> document and have people</font>

925
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,920
do some reviews and say yeah the

926
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:01,299
document looks good um<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

927
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,950
comprehensible it seems internally

928
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:05,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it seems implementable but then</font>

929
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:08,049
let's go then that's absolute last call

930
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:10,180
and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that fix any</font>

931
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:11,740
comments and basically declare the spec

932
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,879
stable and frozen for a little while

933
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:15,430
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can go off in</font>

934
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,980
implements allow a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit of time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

935
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:19,240
don't know probably six weeks to months

936
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,160
for people to go off and do some

937
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:24,520
implementation and then come back

938
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,660
probably sometime in q1 and learn from

939
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">that compare notes on that</font>

940
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:31,120
implementation maybe do some<font color="#CCCCCC"> interop</font>

941
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:32,590
testing see if the spec needs to change

942
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:35,710
needs to clarify if there's any

943
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:37,690
learnings from that and at the only at

944
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:40,210
that point we'll send it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off to the is</font>

945
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,920
you basically do a a pre last call some

946
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:45,970
implementation work to verify that

947
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:50,130
really good and then we really finalize

948
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:50,129
it once we've done that learnings chairs

949
00:38:54,789 --> 00:38:58,839
hurry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people have</font>

950
00:38:57,189 --> 00:39:00,759
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> followed the way things have</font>

951
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,049
worked in HTTP in the past but one of

952
00:39:00,759 --> 00:39:05,009
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do is essentially</font>

953
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:07,390
declare particular versions of them as

954
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:10,179
implementation versions and the target

955
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:11,949
of interrupt so the proposal here is

956
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:16,029
basically will will issue a working

957
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:17,380
group last call and any changes resulted

958
00:39:16,029 --> 00:39:18,809
from today's meeting where the working

959
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,890
group last call will create an

960
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:22,749
implementation version and we'll ask

961
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:25,419
everybody to go who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> building an</font>

962
00:39:22,749 --> 00:39:27,999
implementation and implement to that so

963
00:39:25,419 --> 00:39:30,339
that we can do interrupt testing with a

964
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:31,839
bunch of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> implementations which</font>

965
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:35,699
all believe they're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the same</font>

966
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:37,989
version if we get everybody

967
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:40,779
interoperating right away<font color="#E5E5E5"> boohoo we're</font>

968
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:42,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">done if not we can take whatever turns</font>

969
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:44,979
out not to be interoperable and use that

970
00:39:42,939 --> 00:39:46,689
to raise issues against<font color="#CCCCCC"> the respect to</font>

971
00:39:44,979 --> 00:39:50,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out what other clarifications or</font>

972
00:39:46,689 --> 00:39:52,319
changes are needed my<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience with</font>

973
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,669
this in other working groups is that

974
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:57,029
letting this drag on for very long

975
00:39:54,669 --> 00:40:00,368
periods of time is a failure mode

976
00:39:57,029 --> 00:40:02,319
because people then say oh well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

977
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:04,269
wait and<font color="#E5E5E5"> let some other person finish</font>

978
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:08,919
their implementation first and then I'll

979
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:10,658
I'll do whatever so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we do do</font>

980
00:40:08,919 --> 00:40:12,609
this will do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working group last call</font>

981
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:15,880
pretty aggressively we want to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

982
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:18,038
done and any revs from it done before

983
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year and we want to have</font>

984
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:24,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">the implementation period basically</font>

985
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:31,329
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new year and Chicago so that</font>

986
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:34,349
if we march 25th and so ideally we would

987
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:38,049
come to the conclusion before march 25th

988
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:39,819
that we're complete with this document

989
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:42,369
and we can not even raise it again in

990
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:44,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">chicago if not it gives us a nice place</font>

991
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:48,039
to resolve all the questions that may

992
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:50,409
have come up does anybody have an

993
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:51,969
objection either to the plan that he's

994
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:54,359
presented or to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> timeline we just</font>

995
00:40:51,969 --> 00:40:54,359
discussed

996
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:01,359
will confirm on the list and in means

997
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:04,390
and then we'll figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out if there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

998
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:16,598
any objection there and if not we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

999
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:16,598
following that plan thank you

1000
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:31,250
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're on shuffle and I will talk</font>

1001
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:34,720
for a few minutes about children

1002
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:43,240
certificates it came up in the ER cloth

1003
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:47,240
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous ITF</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's like this so</font>

1004
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:51,459
the the point of the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is to</font>

1005
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:55,120
delegate ownership to delegate

00:41:51,460 --> 00:42:00,020
authorization over a website and

1007
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:02,900
normally i'm a Content owner I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

course so normally<font color="#CCCCCC"> what people do today</font>

1012
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:23,450
is this simply hand out the private key

1013
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:28,450
and certificate to the CDN which is no

1014
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:28,450
fun so we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an alternative</font>

1015
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:38,660
will at the look<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought we looked quite</font>

1016
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:42,500
a bit at a different way of doing it

1017
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:46,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">where each TLS handshake is basically</font>

1018
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:52,700
terminated by a remote box that has the

1019
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:55,940
private key and the signs RSA signs the

1020
00:42:52,700 --> 00:43:00,339
relevant parts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> handshake but</font>

1021
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:03,460
obviously in a CDN scenario<font color="#CCCCCC"> high</font>

1022
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:07,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">performance all I throughput scenario</font>

1023
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:12,080
having a remote box touch each and every

1024
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:15,470
handshake is far from ideal so we are

1025
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:18,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at other ways of doing it and</font>

1026
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:21,560
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> shortened certificates</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1027
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:25,640
published a proposal for shorter and

1028
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:30,140
certificates for the logged off this is

1029
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:33,100
the second iteration<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ideal so Tom</font>

1030
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:38,029
certificates but rather different from

1031
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:41,509
my original proposal next so

1032
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:45,810
at the high level what we have here is

1033
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:49,080
three pieces to the puzzle the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Acme</font>

1034
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:53,160
server that don't domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> honor the</font>

1035
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:57,540
content owner who talks directly to the

1036
00:43:53,160 --> 00:44:03,170
Acme server and then the CDN who talks

1037
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:08,640
to the domain name on asking it to get

1038
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:13,650
to get a certificate for it and then

1039
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:18,359
later on a on a periodic periodic basis

1040
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:21,600
fetches a<font color="#E5E5E5"> short term certificates every</font>

1041
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:29,010
once in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while directly from the ca</font>

1042
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:31,319
from their acne server next as so

1043
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:34,080
further sorry question on the previous

1044
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:36,630
slide so the request for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> star sir</font>

1045
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:42,569
that's like a typical<font color="#E5E5E5"> CSR will have like</font>

1046
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:47,340
yes I'm by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah so initial</font>

1047
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:52,290
setup the domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> name owner and the CDN</font>

1048
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:54,990
establish relationship because you want

1049
00:44:52,290 --> 00:45:01,070
the CDN to authenticate itself when it

1050
00:44:54,990 --> 00:45:06,120
presents a CSR and is asking to to get a

1051
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:09,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">series of short term certificates they</font>

1052
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:13,080
also agree on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy so what domain</font>

1053
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:15,870
name the certificate should cover how

1054
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:22,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">often they should change and so on and</font>

1055
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:27,060
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy is encoded as a csr template</font>

1056
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:30,740
as a binary<font color="#E5E5E5"> csr template that the CDN</font>

1057
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:36,029
will be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use when it requests in</font>

1058
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:39,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">the short-term certificate and then the</font>

1059
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:44,430
domain name owner registers with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> arc</font>

1060
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:47,010
my server next and the course the

1061
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:51,629
protocol is this bootstrapper a phase

1062
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:57,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this is where the CDN is asking</font>

1063
00:45:51,630 --> 00:46:01,170
the dno for to get the short-term

1065
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:09,150
accesses forward state's request into

1066
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:12,570
the acne server so step by step the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CDN</font>

1067
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:17,370
generates a CSR with the template that

1068
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:22,080
it received the offline previously the

<font color="#E5E5E5">Dino validates that the CSI is actually</font>

1070
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:34,370
in line with the template / policy then

1071
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:37,530
it sends the CSR into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> acne server</font>

1072
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:40,440
requesting a short-term certificate or

1073
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:43,590
what we call<font color="#E5E5E5"> short-term automatically</font>

1074
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:49,820
renewed certificate with a cute acronym

1075
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:54,320
star acne does all the normal checks

1076
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:56,670
authorizations were it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DA knows</font>

1077
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:59,310
responsibility to fulfill the

1078
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:04,980
authorizations so if you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to test</font>

1079
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:09,779
the NS or to test HTTP 01 it's the

<font color="#E5E5E5">Dino's business to get it to work and</font>

1081
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:19,650
then once it gets once the ca is happy

1082
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:23,730
with the authorizations it gives back a

1083
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:26,400

1086
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:36,000

every three days or so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> acme the CDN</font>

1090
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:55,109
wants to get and use a new certificate

00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:59,190
so that it always has a valid

enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make to make revocation</font>

ocsp just this revocation next and an

1114
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,560
important piece of the draft is the

1115
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:44,070
security considerations that actually

1116
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:48,450
apply not just to our<font color="#CCCCCC"> proposal but in</font>

1117
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:53,640
general to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case where you use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Acme</font>

in conjunction with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> CD n versus dno</font>

1119
00:49:53,640 --> 00:50:00,450
relent relationship so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is</font>

1120
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:05,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically how do you prevent the CDN or</font>

1121
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:11,210
a rogue employee of the CDN from getting

1122
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:18,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">a certificate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that will apply to the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">content owned by someone else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and what</font>

1124
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:27,150
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> propose is the combination of</font>

1125
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:30,839
security measures that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will revolve</font>

1126
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:34,890
around ens and<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS ownership and</font>

1127
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:39,900
authorization to change to modify DNS

1128
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:43,470
zones but also requires all Acme servers

1129
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:49,700
to respect<font color="#CCCCCC"> CAA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> records which is</font>

uses the proposal in draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> Londo to</font>

1132
00:50:55,290 --> 00:51:02,840
restrict Acme registrations to a

particular DNA to a particular

1134
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:11,130
authorization namely DNS and probably

1135
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:14,130
also to a particular account so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font>

1136
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:24,270
as we understand this all needs to

1137
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:27,780
happen just to enable users of acne to

1138
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:34,680
have this relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> this delegation</font>

1139
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:40,830

1150
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:00,650
applied and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether there's been any</font>

1151
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:02,550

1152
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:06,930
demonstrating an interest to implement

1153
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:09,720
something like this yeah so so we did

1154
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:12,629
have the look Bob and I would say the

1155
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:14,939
ants based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ball the the answer is</font>

1156
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:22,020
sort of mixed but I also had people

1157
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:26,430
approach me separately from the buff so

1158
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:29,610
yes there is some demand by people who

1159
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:34,040
actually care about video streaming for

1160
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:34,040
this kind of technology that it

1161
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:39,730
it's at hardy from the floor so I really

1162
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:41,230
appreciate the way your diagrams make it

1163
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:42,850
very clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what's happening here is</font>

1164
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:45,070
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the domain name owner using</font>

1177
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:17,770
bit further and simplify this radically

1178
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,530
and simply say it continues to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1179
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:22,270
case that that domain name owner goes

1180
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:26,170
through the registrations on a cyclical

1181
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:27,700
basis and refreshes that URL so that you

1182
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:30,040
know they do that every three days the

1183
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:32,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">the CDN gets it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever time scale</font>

1184
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:34,630
they like and that gives you sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:38,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">option or the domain name owner to vary</font>

1186
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:41,200
how long they associate a particular

1187
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:44,170
authorization with a particular CDN as

1188
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:47,020
they go and that variance actually seems

1189
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:49,180
to me quite useful and it also seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1190
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:52,810
be much more in the model of up how

00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:54,790
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Acme to simply say the</font>

1192
00:53:52,810 --> 00:54:02,109

00:53:54,790 --> 00:54:04,119
then at<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the the period when the the</font>

00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:08,980
invalidation for time purposes just

1196
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:10,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">refreshes it and since you're already</font>

00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:13,240
creating this mutually authenticated

1199
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:17,859
you don't just use it and continue to

1200
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:20,350
use certs that that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to</font>

1201
00:54:17,859 --> 00:54:24,190
give a<font color="#E5E5E5"> special nice acronym to but</font>

1202
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:28,509
simply have shorter than usual periods

1203
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:32,050
of validity<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so so yes the the trade</font>

1204
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:34,720
of between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> level of control that the</font>

1205
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:40,590
dno can can have over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole thing</font>

1206
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:44,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">and on the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side what i would call</font>

1207
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:45,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">availability considerations so basically</font>

1208
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:49,710
when you

1209
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:53,700
pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a CDN you would like as much of</font>

1210
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:57,270
the high availability always<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1211
00:54:53,700 --> 00:55:00,629
twenty-four/seven stuff to be on the

1212
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:04,259
city inside and not have the dno

1213
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:07,250
actually be available once every three

1214
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:11,040
days to make sure that this all dance

1215
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:15,140
happens so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's our main</font>

1216
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:17,940
motivation for passing the

1217
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:21,080
responsibility of throwing the

1218
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:25,500
responsibility away from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dno and</font>

1219
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:27,330
into the ca into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CA actually in this</font>

1220
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:30,240
case do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to ask a clarifying</font>

1221
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:32,970
question and so the clarifying question

1222
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:37,560
is whether then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that the the</font>

1223
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:39,480
dno and the CDN are not actually

1224
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:42,000
communicating on other topics within

1225
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,440
this time scale right so if they're if

1226
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,870
they're not getting fresh content or

1227
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,610
otherwise of contacting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dino during</font>

1228
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:50,040
this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> timescale I sort of see your</font>

1229
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:51,540
point but if there's other contacts

1230
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:53,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on I really don't understand why</font>

1231
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:57,500
this would be onerous for the Dino to be

1232
00:55:53,790 --> 00:56:00,800
online to make these these checks I

1233
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:04,020
think it depends very steep ending

1234
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:06,570
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on content and what exactly</font>

1235
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:08,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">you expect the city and to do for you if</font>

1236
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:12,030
you only expect the city and to take

1237
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:14,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">care of static content it's one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing if</font>

1238
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:17,990
there's a lot of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1239
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:22,860
between the CDN and the DA no different

1240
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:26,189
yeah just to also answer um in our

1241
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:27,900
experience the people who manage the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki</font>

1242
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:30,600
are very different from the people who

1243
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:32,130
keep the paint the website up and so we

1244
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,470
had expired you to think it's they gotta

1245
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:41,430
go call someone whereas the website just

1246
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:44,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">keeps going yeah Nick Sullivan CDN</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1252
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:58,970
to expect your CDN and your DNS provider

to be different

1254
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:04,189

00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:17,119
from CTE will become smaller so it

1291
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:18,589
doesn't sound like an actual solution to

1292
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:21,619
me it just sounds like saying sure we

1293
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:31,520
can sort of shuffle the operational

1294
00:59:21,619 --> 00:59:36,650
trade-offs um we<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently adopted or</font>

just about to a CAA proof has anyone how

1296
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:44,900
many people here read Hugo's draft more

1298
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:49,220
wait wait so really that it was only

1299
00:59:47,329 --> 00:59:53,410
Marion Richard who dreaded nobody else

1300
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:57,439

the 5000 feet slide yeah um<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok read it</font>

1304
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:12,589
will have discussion on the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

1305
01:00:10,069 --> 01:00:15,950
is that you go couldn't make it we knew

1306
01:00:12,589 --> 01:00:17,210
he wasn't going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh yeah</font>

1307
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:19,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously we can't have a discussion</font>

1308
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:21,250
when only a couple of people have have

1309
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:23,779
read it we do encourage you to read it

1310
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:27,200
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular if it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

1311
01:00:23,779 --> 01:00:30,349
requirement to adopt the short-term

1312
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:32,270
certificate as currently presented then

1313
01:00:30,349 --> 01:00:34,099
clearly understanding its trade offs as

1314
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:35,150
part of understanding of the larger set

1315
01:00:34,099 --> 01:00:38,289
of trade up surround<font color="#E5E5E5"> short-term</font>

1317
01:00:38,289 --> 01:00:43,609
sorry to clarify no it's not a

1318
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:47,799
requirement for SOTA<font color="#CCCCCC"> certificate the</font>

1319
01:00:43,609 --> 01:00:51,078
whole point of that slide was that

1320
01:00:47,799 --> 01:00:54,710
independently of what solution we choose

1321
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:58,700
and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about the</font>

1322
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:59,250
interaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> of acne with a CDN</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> city and</font>

certificates for telephone numbers that

1361
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:14,040

1362
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:16,170
working group but we desperately need

1363
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,610
are some ways that people can actually

1364
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:20,880
like get them cuz<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're hard to get</font>

a note to the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did not ask for it</font>

1368
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:27,029
in the time here today to discuss this

1369
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:30,090

1370
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:31,680
instr first but expect that to come

1371
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:33,270
around and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah if there's interest and</font>

1372
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,529
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be progressing that here</font>

1373
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:36,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it does define you identifier</font>

1374
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:40,320

1386
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:06,990
right um yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the discussion</font>

1387
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:08,430
from this morning is very positive<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1388
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:11,669
was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of energy there around doing</font>

1389
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:12,990
this we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to probably end up doing</font>

1390
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:14,690
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is doing kind of like some of the</font>

1391
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:17,040
work that's released or a specific instr

1392
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:18,930
about kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like how we'd apply this</font>

1393
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:20,359
to some particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> attack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually doing</font>

1394
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:23,940
the validation so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do within</font>

1395
01:04:20,359 --> 01:04:25,560
sip itself with us but yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1396
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:27,330
discussion there is positive about going

1397
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:29,100
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so necessarily we would need</font>

1398
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:30,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come to here where the expertise is</font>

1399
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:32,220
to work on the parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this that would</font>

1400
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:35,160
be specific to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the finding like new</font>

1401
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:37,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">identify or acne and so on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah positive</font>

1402
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:40,259
session yeah it was yeah there's a lot

1403
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,910
of interest also um terms of scale you

1404
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:44,010
know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea of giving it</font>

1405
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:46,200
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> one cert every single phone and</font>

1406
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:47,789
you know everything smartphone compared

1407
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:51,089
to you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes let's encrypt with</font>

1408
01:04:47,789 --> 01:04:52,650
puny baby steps baby steps we're gonna

1409
01:04:51,089 --> 01:04:55,200
do some incremental things we working

1410
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:57,750
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> serious matters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a giant</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> epa's and</font>

1411
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,098
yet so i think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really likely from</font>

1412
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:00,450
both sides if there's interest in this

1413
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:09,030
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it will also come forward to</font>

1414
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:10,649
the group and anyone else have comments

1415
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:12,839
on future stuff they would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

1416
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:14,670
or think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should be doing or</font>

1417
01:05:12,839 --> 01:05:17,788
think might be of interest to the group

1418
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:19,559
I also see our area director lurking

1419
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:21,780
back there she'd like us to close down

1420
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:24,000
and immediately leave the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> now would</font>

1421
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:26,180
be a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to tell us or if she's</font>

1422
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,809
expecting to tell us that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chicago</font>

1423
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:29,808
also useful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1424
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:40,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kathleen Moriarty um so I gets closed</font>

1425
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:42,470
down to working group the next couple of

1426
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:44,180
days<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'm not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to push other ones</font>

1427

things should be adopted I'm totally

1434
01:05:57,850 --> 01:06:03,130
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it by that and by the</font>

concurrently running a charter

1445
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:37,850
we believe can be tackled in a useful

1446
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:40,310
way in a relatively short term we're not

1447

associate with it but that's okay we

don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve world hunger if we</font>
