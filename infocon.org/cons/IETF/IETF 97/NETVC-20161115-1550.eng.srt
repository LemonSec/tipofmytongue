67
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:49,909
we're going to talk a little bit about

68
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:53,359
what we want to do with the requirements

69
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:55,490
and testing documents and then just a

70
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,620
real quick overview of the changes in

71
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,620
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> two documents probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes</font>

72
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:03,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">or less each on those we're gonna get an</font>

73
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:08,139
update on Thor a similar update on dolla

74
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:11,750
and then the discussion of using pvq

75
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:17,750
outside the dollar codec any comments on

76
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:19,780
the agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> for today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right moving on</font>

77
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:24,260
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go ahead let you take this mo</font>

78
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:28,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so are our first milestone back</font>

79
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:31,550
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we chartered was was too perhaps</font>

80
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:33,949
publish an informational document on

81
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,310
requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> and maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

82
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:40,940
informational document on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> testing</font>

83
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:42,289
and evaluation criteria and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

84
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,440
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> past that milestone by a little bit</font>

85
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:48,409
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should decide what we want to do</font>

86
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,870
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the first question really is</font>

87
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:52,310
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not we think there's value to</font>

88
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:56,330
publish these documents they would only

89
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:59,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">be informational so whatever actual code</font>

90
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:01,099
expec comes out of this effort would not

91
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,830
have any normative dependencies on them

92
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:06,740
but there may be value in referring to

93
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:09,020
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> documents to avoid a bunch of you</font>

94
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,969
know descriptive text in the actual

95
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,659
codec specs about what the motivations

96
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:14,420
for some of the

97
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:18,740
coding tools and choices are so we'd

98
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:20,990
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear about first of all is there</font>

99
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,240
value in publishing them so and the

100
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,740
second question<font color="#E5E5E5"> will ask later is is how</font>

101
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,980
complete are they and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll get a quick</font>

102
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:30,080
update on what the status of them is

103
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:32,510
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the editors but first before that</font>

104
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,099
we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to figure out what are the</font>

105
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,780
views on actually publishing this work

106
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,350
should we progress it as an

107
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:41,510
informational RFC or should we<font color="#E5E5E5"> let it</font>

108
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:43,670
expire that's for both the requirements

109
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,039
draft and the testing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> evaluation</font>

110
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,540
criteria draft and feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> free to answer</font>

111
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,550
the question differently for those two

112
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,080
drafts have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> Campbell you have a</font>

113
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,980
third choice something like the work

114
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,390
group wiki or they letting expire

115
00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:00,080
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have to mean it</font>

116
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:01,580
goes away yeah and I guess the notable

117
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,219
thing is that we wouldn't we wouldn't

118
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,990
reference the big big question in my

119
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,230
mind is whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not there's value in</font>

120
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:11,750
referencing this from whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> normative</font>

121
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:14,720
RFC's the group generates so if we

122
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:17,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">generate a codec and there's a need to</font>

123
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,540
refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to anything in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements or</font>

124
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,460
testing drafts that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think would be a</font>

125
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:24,860
key question for people to give an

126
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:28,570
opinion on<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so Jose actually one of</font>

127
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:34,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">the authors has using like when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cuter</font>

128
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:36,650
yes thank you can you hear me yep yeah I

129
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:40,730
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just said if</font>

130
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:43,099
we if we release the I didn't hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

131
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:45,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">you exactly said well if we release the</font>

132
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:50,690
codec oh I mean that we will read it the

133
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:53,719
corec will be released right the the

134
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:55,400
statement was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if we publish a you</font>

135
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:00,370
know a codec specification that would be

136
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:02,530
you know a normative standards track RFC

137
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:06,890
whether or not there's value in

138
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:10,099
referring to informational RFC s4

139
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:13,340
requirements or testing methodologies

140
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,540
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that's important and if</font>

141
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,849
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> then there's probably not a</font>

142
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,740
good reason to pursue publication of

143
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,479
them if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is then then it probably</font>

144
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,940
is a good reason to try to publish them

145
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,219
right so if we publish a codec then

146
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:28,400
definitely I I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's</font>

147
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:31,910
value in referencing all of these

148
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:37,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">documents that either spell out</font>

149
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:39,979
requirements or testing um just

150
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:44,780
temporary from the floor um just as a

151
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:46,670
point the rc4 opus 6 7 16 did actually

152
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:52,459
reference<font color="#CCCCCC"> its informational requirements</font>

153
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:54,079
document did<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so I'm hearing for</font>

154
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:58,390
requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least some level of</font>

155
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,390
support for pushing that through to RFC

156
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:10,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">Alyssa Cooper just so people are aware</font>

157
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:12,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">the isg put out a statement about</font>

158
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">requirements and use cases and problem</font>

159
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,430
statement type documents earlier this

160
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,740
morning so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might be worth taking a</font>

161
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:21,589
look at you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are basically doing</font>

162
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,510
exactly what the statement suggests

163
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,070
which is that working groups should

164
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:28,069
think about whether they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

165
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:32,060
publish these in in in the is Ustream

166
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:33,740
and should develop their protocol work

167
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,729
in parallel with these documents and not

168
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,220
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> things in sequence which you've</font>

169
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:39,800
obviously been doing and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

170
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,900
recommends against publishing these as

171
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,579
RFC's if the group doesn't have like a

172
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,620
good rationale but I think the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

173
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:48,350
you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and may</font>

174
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,120
reference it gives you leeway to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to justify whatever decision you come to</font>

176
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,510
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wouldn't be concerned about it but</font>

177
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:56,180
it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be worth taking a look at</font>

00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so you know how the I is she is</font>

179
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,959
looking at these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things at the moment</font>

180
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">was there any short summary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what</font>

181
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:07,760
criteria they thought would be useful it

182
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:10,910
yeah it and it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really specify</font>

documents in their queue it sounds like

187
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,890
kind of a don't publish it unless you

188

<font color="#E5E5E5">have a reason and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you go up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the r</font>

yeah I I would say that's true<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font>

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,990
there's it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> mode it wasn't really</font>

198
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:48,610
strictly as an individual I say one

199
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,500
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to consider is what's the archival</font>

200
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:54,600
value of the information in the

201
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:59,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">requirements documents it's one thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

202
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:02,050
to reference them in the solution to say

203
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,520
you met the requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't</font>

204
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">really have a huge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of archival</font>

205
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,730
value but if there's explanatory

206
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,490
material and things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> then there that</font>

207
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:15,940
help people understand the solution then

208
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:19,530
that's a completely different<font color="#CCCCCC"> story Mo's</font>

209
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:21,700
an ID from for Mike I am I have a

00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:24,670
stronger position on the testing

211
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:28,630
document I think there's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

212
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:32,189
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to progress that and publish it</font>

213
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:34,390
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's going to be</font>

214
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:38,110
extensive references from from any of

215
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:42,880
the code expects into it and there's

216
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:44,740
there's a you know you need to know what

217
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,290
you're optimizing for when you're when

218
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:49,300
you're creating these<font color="#E5E5E5"> these codecs and</font>

219
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:54,370
you know not really having targets and

220
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:57,010
you know defined criteria is is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me</font>

221
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,390
what would be would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> strange so each</font>

222
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,220
of the codec specs would actually have

223
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of this information</font>

224
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,820
in them which doesn't seem to make sense

225
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,860
to be better just to reference the

226
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,930
information once and it would already

227
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,780
have the explanations of you know why a

228
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">metric that's you know objective versus</font>

229
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,890
more perceptually warranted you know

230
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,110
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good justification for</font>

231
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,580
including a tool that's giving objective

232
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,370
gains vs. a tool that's giving you know

233
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,560
mostly subjective gains so I think

234
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:26,680
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good reasons</font>

235
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,239
to publish a testing draft the

236
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,630
requirements I think there's some some

237
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,480
weaker justifications to publish it

238
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:36,700
mostly around you know why certain tools

239
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,610
may be needed when they don't directly

240
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:43,350
help the testing metrics you know so

241
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:45,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to justify all the tools that</font>

242
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:48,880
directly give you gains directly give

243
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:51,820
you you know objective metrics

244
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,290
gains and subjective quality gains but

245
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,910
then there may be some other tools that

246
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:57,160
don't actually give you gains in any of

247
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,680
those but they're still useful anyway

248
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,410
for things like arrow resilience or for

249
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,229
parallelism and instead of having to

250
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:08,110
discuss all of the needs of you know of

251
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:10,900
those non you know quality impacting

252
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,880
tools it's good just<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference them in a</font>

253
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:20,350
requirements document but also that's

254
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:22,750
less of a less of a concern for me ok so

255
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,670
I'm hearing no outright opposition I'm

256
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">hearing you know guidance about make</font>

257
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:30,990
certain it's necessary and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I think</font>

258
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:34,510
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some fairly good reasons that</font>

259
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:37,600
there's a benefit here so would anyone

260
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:44,380
like to speak up in in favor of the

261
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:52,330
position of not publishing these<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I'll</font>

262
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:56,590
take it we had no she did that last time

263
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:57,940
um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I'm in its we already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

264
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:00,910
had this question raised in the list

265
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,740
there was one person sorry also screen

266
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,089
oh we did again there was one person's

267
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,880
woke up in favor of it it was otherwise

268
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:08,530
silent<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say you know we can take</font>

269
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,530
this to the list but there's probably

270
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:12,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to be very little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> additional</font>

271
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:16,900
comment so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suspect we will do is</font>

272
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:18,189
sometime in the next few weeks put

273
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">together a shepherd right up on these</font>

274
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:30,060
and and put them forth presuming that we

275
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:39,190
think they're done at this point so yes

276
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:41,560
wiggle your yeah your<font color="#CCCCCC"> dongle nothing was</font>

277
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,880
working it's just we've got make your

278
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:48,130
time at<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> screensaver</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time out</font>

279
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:51,620
because this has been on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their time let</font>

280
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:54,750
me try switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> um there we go</font>

281
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:57,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright screens here down at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of</font>

282
00:14:54,750 --> 00:15:02,880
this and I presume<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to cover</font>

283
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:05,130
the UM to slide back yes oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> well we can</font>

284
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,810
let Jose speak to it if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to Jose</font>

285
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:15,840
if you want to UM talk to your uh your

286
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:20,819
requirements update is it cute yes I

287
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:23,790
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to okay can you hear me yep</font>

288
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:27,090
okay great<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lottie so thank you I</font>

289
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:33,030
can see that so the changes from the

290
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:36,120
previous version 02 were very minimal I

291
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:41,880
guess the most important one was that

292
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:44,490
originally we had 12 QP<font color="#E5E5E5"> points for for</font>

293
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,830
the evaluation and we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to only</font>

294
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,900
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 so that's really the major major</font>

295
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:52,170
change so if you could go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font>

296
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:57,689
page<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will go very quickly on on what</font>

297
00:15:52,170 --> 00:16:01,500
we did over the over this past few

298
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:03,930
months so there were three main parts of

299
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,570
the document overview of applications

300
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:09,150
use cases etc there were no changes in

301
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:11,610
that then the section on the

302
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:14,040
requirements themselves and then the

303
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:20,070
evaluation methodology which were minor

304
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:24,449
changes so next slide please so the

305
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:26,760
basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirements and I can't see that</font>

306
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:29,400
too well so let me pull out my own copy

307
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,830
here so that I can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

308
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:34,020
basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirements essentially what we</font>

309
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:36,690
changed we agreed that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bitstream</font>

310
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:39,360
specification should support

311
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:43,080
independently decodable subframe units

312
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:47,040
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like slices or independent tiles</font>

313
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:48,750
but you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't necessarily say</font>

314
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that's exactly what they have to be</font>

315
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:53,520
but they must be independently decodable

316
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,980
and so it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible for the</font>

317
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:59,130
encoder to restrict the bitstream to

318
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:02,010
allow parsing of the bitstream after

319
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:05,250
some packet loss so we had some quite a

320
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:07,170
bit of discussions on that and how to

321
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,480
to specified in how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> communicate it to</font>

322
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:12,930
the decoder so that was really the basic

323
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:17,599
the only change in the basic requirement

324
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:20,490
so to be more explicit as to packet loss

325
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,929
partial packet loss and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

326
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:29,820
optional requirements there were no

327
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:33,180
changes at all<font color="#CCCCCC"> its next please so yes so</font>

328
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:36,240
as I was saying the really main major

329
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:39,000
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess was that we we decided</font>

330
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,450
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of QP points was reduced</font>

331
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,560
from 12 to 10 to simplify and to be able

332
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:52,230
to better in quickly more quickly assess

333
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:54,870
the equality and we decided that we will

334
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:57,960
perform<font color="#CCCCCC"> that alignment only on for QP</font>

335
00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:01,229
points so now we have the same as<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

336
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:06,660
three different sections or low middle

337
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:10,950
and high and then for for QP points and

338
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:15,540
the the ends overlap basically and so we

339
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:17,940
also continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use PSN</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are and ms ssim</font>

340
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:20,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">for basic quality assessment so</font>

341
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:24,410
essentially we simplify the process so

342
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:28,980
that it can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done more efficiently</font>

343
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:32,190
next please so that's that's basically

344
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:36,990
it so essentially the the conclusions

345
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:39,180
were that as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see here we try to</font>

346
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:42,780
take into<font color="#E5E5E5"> account all the comments that</font>

347
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:44,400
we did over the the list and so that's

348
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:51,300
that's basically it thank you any

349
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:54,480
questions so first one comment I think

350
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:57,600
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Thomas de do it was</font>

351
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,730
not here today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think he sent out a</font>

352
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,659
comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the list after your last</font>

353
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:07,410
update did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to check that and he</font>

354
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:09,660
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah he's uh he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is remote I</font>

355
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:11,700
think so Thomas can can speak to that if

356
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:15,990
you want I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to leave the</font>

357
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:27,320
line and let Thomas okay I'll do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

358
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:27,320
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right am I in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> front</font>

359
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:34,230
I at Thomas Teddy take Thomas<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stadium</font>

360
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:37,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">missoula um I sent a couple comments uh</font>

361
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:41,130
they're all minor issues I mean it's it

362
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:49,860
I think it's ready as is um it was just

363
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:52,200
a couple wording things so as a reminder

364
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,389
we did last call this bag was August and

365
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,180
so we're basically at the other end of

366
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,410
last call so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's anyone who</font>

367
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,440
thinks this is not ready for publication

368
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:02,490
please stand up now<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise like I</font>

369
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,650
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we're going to go ahead and</font>

370
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">write this up and then to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the isg and</font>

371
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,290
even if you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> objections it</font>

372
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,670
would be great to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> some more viewers</font>

373
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,500
because we haven't had much feedback on

374
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:12,320
this at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all and it's a pretty important</font>

375
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,490
document to make sure that we have the

376
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:19,020
Codex looking at the right set of

377
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:20,490
requirements so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get more views</font>

378
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:28,950
that'd be great does anyone want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

379
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:32,090
volunteer yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm keeping looking back</font>

380
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,090
and forth between the uplanders here

381
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:46,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well I mean I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guess we could try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

382
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:50,700
tim is there anyone on your team<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

383
00:20:46,050 --> 00:21:00,210
could convince<font color="#CCCCCC"> too obviously Thomas</font>

384
00:20:50,700 --> 00:21:02,400
looked through things<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

385
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,930
great thanks I mean ideally we want to

386
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,610
get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the door relatively quickly</font>

387
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,230
there's there's not any hard deadline

388
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:10,860
but just in a matter of you know getting

389
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:13,260
things nailed down sometimes one new

390
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,939
fresh read is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really useful rather than</font>

391
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,900
someone who's looked at you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know four</font>

392
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:24,620
iterations of this from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very</font>

393
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:28,410
beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right thanks Tim will</font>

394
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:31,100
cough up a volunteer it's a review at

395
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,100
least one reviewer

396
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,940
it's a subject to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outcome of those</font>

397
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,980
reviews it sounds like there is a

398
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,330
wording change that Thomas is adjusted

399
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,150
so they'll probably be at least one more

400
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,740
revision before you public it and i

401
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,960
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the it's like what i'm concluding</font>

402
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">here is we will have probably tim have</font>

403
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,280
one more person review it updated

404
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,810
according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and thomas's input and</font>

405
00:21:54,280 --> 00:22:14,490
then do a pub<font color="#E5E5E5"> break as soon as that new</font>

406
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:14,490
version comes out yes right<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

407
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:30,370
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good question maybe we ought to</font>

408
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:33,730
troubleshoot that cuz the tools sprint

409
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:35,080
had like five people Johnny I just

410
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,400
commenting that the data tracker shows

411
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,439
the version 3 of the stock was published

412
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,250
both on August fourth and doesn't ever

413
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,570
21st so that's a little perplexing

414
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:47,770
August fourth is when we issued the last

415
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:52,240
call that was when we sent out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

416
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:56,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">group last call the data tracker history</font>

417
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,030
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> net bc requirements anyway that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

418
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,640
this group's problem I'd nice cool know

419
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:03,310
that that's can you send email to the

420
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,400
tools team about that you change the

421
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:12,899
state to something when you issue the

422
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's go i might have dim</font>

423
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:22,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about the the</font>

424
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:25,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">latest revision of the testing draft um</font>

425
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:27,590
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thomas daddy is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the author for um</font>

426
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:33,049
and while use here remotely he asked me

427
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:35,270
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> present in person if sorry that</font>

428
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:37,549
better I'm a tilt it up tilt the mic up

429
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:41,480
there you go about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that okay excellent</font>

430
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:43,160
um so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will do my best job and Thomas</font>

431
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,150
will interrupt me if I start<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling any</font>

432
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:49,549
lies um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> their their basic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two basic</font>

433
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:55,520
things metric updates and range updates

434
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:57,740
slide um so for the metric updates um we

435
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,679
have removed fastest as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am entirely</font>

436
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:05,120
and replaced it with regular MSS<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font>

437
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:07,370
armed so we re amenta dem<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSS i am from</font>

438
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,639
scratch referencing several of the

439
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:12,439
popular implementations of it um and in

440
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,230
doing so we found some bugs in the

441
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:19,700
fastest i am implementation which we'll

442
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:22,190
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> more later on but the speed</font>

443
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,559
difference between the two is relatively

444
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:27,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">small compared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to how incredibly slow</font>

445
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:31,760
all modern<font color="#E5E5E5"> video codecs are at least in</font>

446
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,890
in in the development versions um so we

447
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:39,980
didn't see a point in using the the fast

448
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:44,179
version side arm we also updated the

449
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:47,240
text on VMA<font color="#E5E5E5"> f which is the metric</font>

450
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:50,600
proposed by netflix um one point of

451
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:53,809
clarification was was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that unlike</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sm and</font>

452
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,760
MSS somewhere we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this log conversion</font>

453
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:59,600
to make them give numbers that look

454
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:02,059
vaguely like PS and our decibels arm 44

455
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,879
vm AF we just used<font color="#CCCCCC"> the scores directly</font>

456
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:06,559
and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> matches the neth addala g that</font>

457
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:14,179
netflix themselves used in their own

458
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:15,559
studies next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide arm so we clarified</font>

459
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:18,679
some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> specification of the</font>

460
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:20,870
quantizer ranges<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use so for</font>

461
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,120
individual tool testing we now<font color="#E5E5E5"> list for</font>

462
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:25,340
explicit quantizers and for the final

463
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,959
requirements testing we match the update

464
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:30,679
you heard of in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements draft</font>

465
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,030
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten specific quantizers and that</font>

466
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,590
is a change<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the previous version</font>

467
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,149
where we just specify the minimum in the

468
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:37,310
maximum but not any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the points in</font>

469
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:40,940
between so now we're explicit about

470
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:46,399
everything uh and i think that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

471
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:48,860
last slide oh sorry one more on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

472
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,980
yeah so so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this document is not</font>

473
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:56,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite done yet um we wanted to add a few</font>

474
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:59,930
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> clips arm one specifically at very</font>

475
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,969
low resolutions um just because some of

476
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:03,740
the the important use cases are dealing

477
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:05,360
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> very low bandwidth situations and</font>

478
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:09,290
so you want your scalable video to go

479
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,479
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way down to 240p arm and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

480
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:13,850
the other end we also wanted to make

481
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:18,140
sure we had at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least some HDR sequences</font>

482
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:19,909
on in the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> baseline test set um so we</font>

483
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:23,150
were not able to get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> finalized in</font>

484
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:25,280
time for the the ITF draft deadline but

485
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:26,630
you can see a preview of the the

486
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:30,560
sequences that we're planning<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

487
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:42,890
at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> URL and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is the last</font>

488
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:46,159
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> most from for Mike again question on</font>

489
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:50,540
the on the netflix metrics so now those

490
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:52,400
are incorporated into the the testing

491
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:54,620
site are we compressed a testing site um

492
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,140
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they are not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yet incorporate</font>

493
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,489
into our we compressed yet um so netflix

494
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,340
has published the source for<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

495
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:03,230
metric but it doesn't take input in the

496
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,939
same form that we have all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our test</font>

497
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:07,310
sequences stored in and so we need to

498
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:10,310
modify the input modules and that just

499
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:12,590
hasn't happened yet ok<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the testing</font>

500
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:14,540
draft says now is just how to use that

501
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:16,179
metric right<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing is actually using</font>

502
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:19,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and nothing has actually generated</font>

503
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:21,980
numbers out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that of a dollar</font>

504
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,780
or Thor anything else yet yeah we wrote

505
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:27,250
a specification before we implemented it

506
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:30,740
and it's unusual at the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> the firm</font>

507
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:33,560
what is their plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> two minute yeah i</font>

508
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:35,660
mean it is on our to-do list so we'll

509
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:38,129
get it up there at some point um it's

510
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:47,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a matter of typing</font>

511
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:51,030
okay just<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing yeah all right thanks</font>

512
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:52,620
oh here we go I think you've noticed

513
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:57,120
Tommy stadium is a lot I was a

514
00:27:52,620 --> 00:28:00,810
convention I I run the tool oakley with

515
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,370
the is using hurting though the input

516
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:05,159
formats myself in the works like that

517
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:07,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can implement it as is my just have</font>

518
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,840
a i posted on the job right as a working

519
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,420
pet our progress patch so that's

520
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,070
hopefully coming or very soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it is</font>

521
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:16,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually possible implemented draft as</font>

522
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:29,840
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just haven't done it on the main</font>

523
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:31,980
website yet thanks all right let's rule

524
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,000
what we're hearing from this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

525
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,080
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to finalize a testing</font>

526
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,290
document you think there's still some

527
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:44,030
significant changes to come in um yeah

528
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:46,950
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think in addition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the the</font>

529
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:48,750
updates to the test sequences at some

530
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:51,570
point we're probably also one of going

531
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,890
to want to think about arm testing

532
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:56,220
things like rate control and we don't

533
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:58,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a test procedure for that yet um so</font>

534
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,930
as we flush out our rate control

535
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:04,500
experiments i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll we'll come up</font>

536
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:06,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good criteria for that Adam to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

537
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:12,300
document so what do you think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

538
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:16,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">frames</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that might be armed probably</font>

539
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:20,940
at least three months<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all right</font>

540
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,990
thanks Jose yeah thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just a very</font>

541
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,610
quick thing going back to the

542
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:26,580
requirement you know I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

543
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:29,280
included Thomas's<font color="#CCCCCC"> comment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm gonna</font>

544
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:31,500
ask Thomas to please you know later on

545
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,649
to quickly take a look at the document

546
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">and make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we included your</font>

547
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:45,470
comments Thomas so that that's basically

548
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:45,469
it thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

549
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll go through the changes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

550
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:58,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">force since</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last meeting which is</font>

551
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:59,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a long list but in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of number</font>

552
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:03,070
of changed code lines is probably the

553
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:06,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">biggest update between a meeting next</font>

554
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:10,919
like this and most important<font color="#CCCCCC"> change is</font>

555
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:14,230
that Thor now supports<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 and 12 bit</font>

556
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:17,830
video input and of course it also have

557
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:20,890
them support for high internal pretty

558
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:24,850
position but that can be set regardless

559
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:27,730
of the input and we've added quite a few

560
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:30,310
optimizations and the source code has

561
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:32,650
been reworked a bit to allow different

562
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:37,600
bit depth while staying reasonably

563
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:42,580
efficient next one so the input video

564
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:44,379
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8 10 or 12 bits and so can also</font>

565
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:47,020
the internal bit depth but that can be

566
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:51,880
set totally independent of the input

567
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:55,900
video so we can then have a compression

568
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:58,810
gain for 8-bit video if the internal bit

569
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:04,360
of desire but it adds something like

570
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:06,520
thirty forty percent or complexity on

571
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:09,729
the encode aside and slightly more on

572
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:15,040
the decoder side and it's also possible

573
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:17,620
to encode 10 and 12 bits video within

574
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,870
eight bits internal bit depth which

575
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:22,719
reduces the complexity but basically you

576
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:25,510
destroy all the benefits that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

577
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:29,950
from high bit depth so you're probably

578
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:31,990
desperate if you do that and the video

579
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:35,580
bit depth and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internal bit depth are</font>

580
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:39,190
signaled in the sequence header next one

581
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:42,790
so as I mentioned there's a gain to the

582
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:46,210
head if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can call 8-bit video with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

583
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:48,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">higher internal bit depth so these are</font>

584
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:53,590
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers that we get 4 10 bits in</font>

585
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:58,390
turn depth all these sequences are HD

586
00:31:53,590 --> 00:32:01,810
and on average we get three points a 3.8

587
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:07,690
gain<font color="#CCCCCC"> its slightly less for lower</font>

588
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:12,790
resolutions and the best gains are had

589
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:17,970
for the high bit rates which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suspect</font>

590
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:22,200
is that the reason for that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that at</font>

591
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:26,140
higher bit rates the rolling<font color="#CCCCCC"> errors are</font>

592
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:30,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">becoming more important next one place</font>

593
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:34,350
and if we move up to 12 bits internal

594
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:39,910
bit depth the gains are slightly better

595
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:42,719
four point three percent and it's it's a

596
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:48,580
result of both reducing the bit rate and

597
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:50,830
increase in peace in our next one moving

598
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:54,100
on to how it looks in in chroma this is

599
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:57,280
the you component and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get quite</font>

600
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:59,649
good gains almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirteen percent but</font>

601
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,330
these numbers have have to be taken with

602
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:04,600
a grain of salt because this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> B they</font>

603
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:08,710
are calculated<font color="#CCCCCC"> using UPS NAR and a bit</font>

604
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:12,909
rate dominated by<font color="#CCCCCC"> white but it means</font>

605
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:15,700
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chroma P&R goes up quite a bit</font>

606
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:19,000
so so it's the gains<font color="#E5E5E5"> are definitely</font>

607
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:21,850
higher for chroma and the next one place

608
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,080
and these are for the key component is

609
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:30,760
almost identical numbers again almost

610
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:33,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">thirteen percent and I think the reason</font>

611
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:37,090
he started conscious in chroma is

612
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:43,720
smaller so then rounding errors become

613
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:47,439
more critical yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> mam move from floor</font>

614
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:49,090
mark again so I was surprised by how

615
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,510
large these numbers were<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually</font>

616
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:54,669
shocked by the the chroma numbers I

617
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:56,470
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that that much gain was</font>

618
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:59,980
possible just from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple one or two</font>

619
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:02,890
bit too or forbid extension so it made

620
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:04,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">me wonder whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or not we think the so</font>

621
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,970
that missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just straight pious</font>

00:34:10,779 --> 00:34:17,480
you seeing the increase in is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:19,638
<font color="#CCCCCC">active in those numbers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so uh I</font>

627
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:23,299
guess what I'm wondering is are these

628
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:25,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">just the imperceptible gains that we</font>

629
00:34:23,299 --> 00:34:28,730
think may be a subjective metric

630
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:31,069
wouldn't be wouldn't be as as favorable

631
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:33,139
or do we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

632
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:35,359
really a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> quality gain because the</font>

633
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:38,149
numbers suggest pretty dramatic quality

634
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:42,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kings quite often chroma numbers aren't</font>

635
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:45,348
reported at all since we spent cubits

636
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:47,059
and chroma anyway but it may even<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

637
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:49,789
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the luma ones even the LUMO ones</font>

638
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:52,399
especially for video copies simple

639
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:54,440
content for simple content the the even

640
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:59,839
the LUMO that was pretty high hit like a

tin man yeah eight<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sixteen percent</font>

they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be similar um since we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

647
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:25,039
the same transform you can do the exact

same thing in h.265 by just upsampling

649
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,720
the video input and then pick a high

650
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:32,869
profile<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do things in twelve bits and</font>

if see if ms sm gives us anything or if

657
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:52,759
we can ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> give vmf running see if that</font>

658
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:56,720
gives similar gains but those high

659
00:35:52,760 --> 00:36:00,170
chroma members make make it's tempting

660
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,209
to perhaps shifty chroma QP so you take

661
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:04,609
some of the gain from chrome and fitting

662
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:09,950
into lumens that at least is something

663
00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:13,609
to consider um to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tarifa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> missoula yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

664
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:16,250
think computing PSN are our computing<font color="#E5E5E5"> BD</font>

665
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:19,119
rate changes using PSN are from chroma

666
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:21,190
but total bit rate for the sequence is

667
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,470
basically garbage

668
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:25,510
um you eighty to ninety percent of your

669
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:27,009
bits are in the LUMO component so if you

670
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,300
change<font color="#CCCCCC"> the luma component in some way</font>

671
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,829
that's independent of how the chroma

672
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,319
changes then your whole curve will shift

673
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:33,220
by large amounts like you saw yeah so

674
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:36,220
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not telling you how the</font>

675
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:38,410
chroma quality changed so so that's why

676
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,598
I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> those numbers have to be taken</font>

677
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:44,910
with a grain of salt yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's uh the</font>

678
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:48,280
chroma p is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't go up um so um</font>

679
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:53,140
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> oreck compressed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jet has a metric</font>

680
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:55,960

682
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:02,849
which is a very PSN are like measurement

683
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:05,500
but actually takes color into account in

684
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:07,329
you know attempting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use human</font>

685
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:11,349
perceptual<font color="#E5E5E5"> judgment of color to to</font>

686
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:13,890
estimate distances um and so I I think

687
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:16,359
that is a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more reliable metric on</font>

688
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:20,290
to evaluate whether or not you are

689
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:23,290
improving or actually improving luma and

690
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:25,650
chroma versus just you know I I'm

691
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:27,670
shifted a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of little bits and then</font>

692
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:34,119
you know something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else happened to my</font>

693
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:36,609
chrome occurs yeah I try to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

694
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:40,089
numbers from<font color="#E5E5E5"> our become press yet before</font>

695
00:37:36,609 --> 00:37:43,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">the meeting but it's the thought code</font>

696
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:45,759
seems to have bit related so I think

697
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:48,660
Thomas has has fixed it now but but I

698
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,660
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the numbers</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I go tom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> toms de Mesilla I do have the</font>

700
00:37:52,809 --> 00:38:01,920
numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh it's about a six percent gain</font>

701
00:37:56,019 --> 00:38:01,919

702
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:13,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thank you yeah next month is yeah</font>

703
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:17,199
so supporting higher bit depth that

704
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:20,169
means some adjustments<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the code so</font>

705
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:22,900
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had to be changed where</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">same thing for the trestle and beta for</font>

716
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:54,420
of the deblocking filter and of course

717
00:38:52,089 --> 00:38:56,890
we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> adjust the pics to clipping</font>

718
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:59,739
whereas the conversation and the

720
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:04,059
the QP range remains the same and that

721
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:08,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes sense for me from a user</font>

722
00:39:04,059 --> 00:39:12,190
perspective I think h.265 is doing it

723
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:15,309
differently I guess it really depends on

724
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:18,489
whether the<font color="#E5E5E5"> increased death is for</font>

725
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:24,039
increased accuracy or for high dynamic

726
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:26,650
range but the user can always change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

727
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:30,400
QP in the application and do whatever he

728
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:32,769
even thinks this is right so these are

729
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,130
small changes on paper but they have

730
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:37,959
large implications for the source code

731
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:43,539
because we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have optimized source</font>

732
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:47,198
code next one please so we have a bunch

733
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:52,359
of optimizations for eight bits frame

734
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:54,789
buffers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we want to keep those so</font>

735
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:58,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">the source code had to be changed to</font>

736
00:39:54,789 --> 00:40:00,500
handle both 8-bit frame buffers and

737
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:05,000
16-bit frame buffers

738
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:06,740
who have been doing this in<font color="#CCCCCC"> C++ this</font>

739
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,240
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be easy to implement using</font>

740
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:14,859
templates but we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> written for in c99</font>

741
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:18,020
so instead of templates we use a

742
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:24,200
preprocessor magic to diminish C++

743
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:29,570
templates arm so much of the cold in the

744
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:32,149
encode and decode now get instantiated

745
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:37,070
twice once for a bit frame buffers and

746
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:39,290
once for 16-bit frame buffers the key is

747
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:42,350
that the amount of source code remains

748
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:49,840
roughly the same but the executables

749
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:52,400
increase in size next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one so for uses an</font>

750
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:55,610
abstraction how common seem the

751
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:59,450
intrinsic support simdi optimizations

752
00:40:55,610 --> 00:41:00,980
for different architectures reason for

753
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:03,500
this is that we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to write</font>

754
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:05,960
seeing the optimized code once and an

755
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:08,360
have good results on multiple

756
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,730
architectures so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> was something</font>

757
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:13,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I presented in in Yokohama a year</font>

758
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:15,590
ago and this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> required for</font>

759
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:17,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">Standardization but it's still useful to</font>

760
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,670
assess the complexity in real

761
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:23,810
applications and and it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes the</font>

762
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:28,700
reference codec more shipping ready so

763
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:32,470
we have a lot of seen the optimized code

764
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:36,140
for 8-bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now it's admin needs a</font>

765
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:38,120
counterpart for higher bit depth and we

766
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:42,170
have several thousand lines of code so

767
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:44,359
this is possibly a large task it takes a

768
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:48,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of time to write code like that next</font>

769
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:53,510
one please so instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of spending weeks</font>

770
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:56,660
or months on writing such code arm it's

771
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:58,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible to convert the existing code</font>

772
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:01,580
automatically and get reasonably good

773
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:05,839
results<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for instance if you have done</font>

774
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:08,930
in 36 like an<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight-lane eight-speed add</font>

775
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:12,050
that could convert it to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight-lane</font>

776
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:14,060
16 with that an assistive<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 bits load</font>

777
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:18,950
becomes 120

778
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:25,009
8bit load and so on and in order to do

779
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:29,120
that there was a need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add a new set</font>

780
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:34,310
of injuring six that are 256 bit wide so

781
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:40,120
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could convert convert 16</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lane 8</font>

782
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:44,509

783
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:49,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">so that was added along with a native</font>

784
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:54,230
support for<font color="#E5E5E5"> ATX to otherwise these new</font>

785
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:57,980
256 bits intrinsic are emulated which is

786
00:42:54,230 --> 00:43:01,700
mostly by simply duplicating<font color="#CCCCCC"> 128 bit</font>

787
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:04,670
intrinsic so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end we end up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

788
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:06,919
just one set of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cindy optimized code to</font>

789
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:14,780
maintain regardless of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bit depth and</font>

790
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:17,120
architecture next one arm but it did it

791
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:19,760
needed a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes of the existing</font>

792
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:24,170
code to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that possible so so rather</font>

793
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:28,010
than writing new code I rework the

794
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:31,130
existing code it's just as fast as

795
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:34,730
before but it's now trivial to convert

796
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:40,550
and it's just a matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> of searching</font>

797
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:46,370
replays done by a set script and now

798
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:50,390
that we have even widened in chicks we

799
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:52,730
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the door open to add a txt</font>

800
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:57,770
optimizations even for the 8-bit code

801
00:43:52,730 --> 00:44:02,090
but that has not yet be done next so to

802
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:04,550
just have a summary of the input formats

803
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:07,130
that Thor supports now that's 8 10 and

804
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:09,230
12<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's video and we also have for 20</font>

805
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:12,650
and 40 for chroma sampling which was

806
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:15,200
adding added before last meeting and we

807
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:19,340
have basic simple but optimises

808
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:21,710
optimizations for everything still a few

809
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:23,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that's not directly supported</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

810
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:27,680
it can be trivially handle it like

811
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:31,490
intellect video and RGB 444

812
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:34,250
we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> updated the github so it's</font>

813
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:36,770
possible to download this place latest

814
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:40,970
changes and and play with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with and</font>

815
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:45,410
one wants to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and finally nice</font>

816
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:48,348
one place these are exactly the same

817
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:53,450
curves that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have shown before so this</font>

818
00:44:48,349 --> 00:44:58,210
is just a reminder there's no big

819
00:44:53,450 --> 00:45:02,859
changes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> these plots scenes for a</font>

proper<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple to Apple comparison account</font>

821
00:45:02,859 --> 00:45:09,348
use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the gains from higher internal</font>

822
00:45:06,109 --> 00:45:12,230
bit depth in this plot since you can do

823
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:14,030
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing with h.265 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vp9 and</font>

824
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:19,540
and the gain<font color="#CCCCCC"> sites respect would be</font>

825
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:24,619
quite similar so this basically shows

826
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:28,190
what four is<font color="#CCCCCC"> good at and perhaps not so</font>

827
00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:33,200
good at one axis is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> frame rate and</font>

828
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:36,950
the other is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> quality and Thor is not</font>

829
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:40,210
able to match h.265 if we have infinite

830
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:45,410
computing resources but for practical

831
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:49,819
applications for seems to have a much

832
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:53,149
better complexity compression trade-off

833
00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:55,308
and this is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the low delay conquer</font>

834
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:58,010
the configuration and if we move on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

835
00:45:55,309 --> 00:46:04,490
the high delay configuration on the next

836
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:07,940
slide then sore still has a better trade

837
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:11,868
off than h.265 but it's not quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

838
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:14,660
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> match VV 9 at least leave in I'm for</font>

839
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:18,680
most part runs faster but I also<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font>

840
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:22,790
that vp9 has more seemly optimizations

841
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:27,649
so it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to rise for</font>

842
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:32,930
care of it so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know not a long list</font>

843
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:35,359
of new tools this time um so we could

844
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:40,160
perhaps rather say that for has matured

845
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:43,150
a bit now support no supporting what it

846
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,149
absolutely needs to support

847
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:49,920
so yeah any questions things to discuss

848
00:46:53,130 --> 00:47:02,290
so I'm at a point about the surprising

849
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:05,589
game for the high bit depth if Jose

850
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:06,790
could come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in the queue I'm</font>

851
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:08,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to recall what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did the</font>

852
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:10,359
requirements say about high bit

853
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:13,720
difficult and we iterated a few times

854
00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:16,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">back and forth on that is it is it just</font>

855
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:19,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">an optional requirement or is it a</font>

856
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:23,140
separate profile or are we baking hi bit

857
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:26,109
depth internal precision into the basic

858
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:28,089
requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> for any candidate now it</font>

859
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:34,960
sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like maybe we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should if I if the</font>

860
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:37,540
gain is really that good is he talking

861
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:40,480
Jose yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh sorry i was i was unmute</font>

862
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:42,759
yes so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess your question is whether</font>

863
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:46,450
that is in the basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirements or is</font>

864
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:49,570
it an optional requirement right yeah

865
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:52,569
and specifically allowing the internal

866
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:55,990
high bit depth option not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

867
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:58,780
bit or 12 input sources but can we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

868
00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:00,819
you know 10 or 12 bit internal precision

869
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:02,800
for 8-bit sources if the gain is really

870
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,840
you know as high as we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing</font>

871
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,109
reported here right so what we have in

872
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:11,530
the basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirements is 8 and 10 bits</font>

873
00:48:08,109 --> 00:48:16,020
and up to 12 bits for high profile so

874
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:22,150
those were put in the basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirements</font>

875
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:25,119
internally there's really no explicit in

876
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:31,050
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the basic requirements</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also no</font>

877
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:35,380
explicit restrictions on any complexity

878
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:42,880
well it's a requirement to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 bits</font>

879
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:46,060
in potato um then I suppose there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

880
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:49,210
reason why<font color="#CCCCCC"> not use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's even 48 bits</font>

881
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:52,029
video input since it has to be

882
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:54,480
implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway but the trick really</font>

883
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:56,079
is what you do internally not what the

884
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,759
resolution

885
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:02,019
what what kind of resolution that you

886
00:48:57,759 --> 00:49:05,049
accept and the software wise<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is no</font>

887
00:49:02,019 --> 00:49:10,799
difference between<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 or 12 bits video</font>

888
00:49:05,049 --> 00:49:15,099
in complexity so if you have to support

889
00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:17,319
10 bits you can just as well support 12

890
00:49:15,099 --> 00:49:21,420
bits and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then use that as an internal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

891
00:49:17,319 --> 00:49:21,420
at least from a software perspective

892
00:49:24,569 --> 00:49:32,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">then um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to interior from ZOA so um I</font>

893
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:34,450
know you guys talk to while<font color="#E5E5E5"> up go about</font>

894
00:49:32,279 --> 00:49:36,999
implementing arithmetic coding in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thor</font>

895
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:38,229
is is there any progress on that or is

896
00:49:36,999 --> 00:49:44,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">that something you're working i think</font>

897
00:49:38,229 --> 00:49:48,098
arithmetic coding um we have thought

898
00:49:44,259 --> 00:49:52,209
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I if about half a year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I</font>

899
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:55,660
did some experiments I tried a couple of

900
00:49:52,209 --> 00:49:57,749
ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually an had a couple of</font>

901
00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:04,379
working implementation using that but

902
00:49:57,749 --> 00:50:09,118
the gains were very small and even if I

903
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:13,749
cheated just assuming that I would reach

904
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:15,849
the entropy the gains were quite small

905
00:50:13,749 --> 00:50:17,618
so the trick here isn't really

906
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:23,680
arithmetic<font color="#E5E5E5"> holding with how we do the</font>

907
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:28,119
adoption so currently it's not on the

908
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:30,698
agenda um since the gains were so small

909
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:34,119
and there also are some benefits of

910
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:37,359
doing it like we do now it keeps<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

911
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:46,440
simple and good for error resilience and

912
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:46,440
so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ok thank you either</font>

913
00:50:46,900 --> 00:51:00,369
all right and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tim's new doctors</font>

914
00:50:52,900 --> 00:51:07,180
about dollar<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right good people here</font>

915
00:51:00,369 --> 00:51:08,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay good so um say that that there has</font>

916
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,509
not been a large number of changes in

917
00:51:08,859 --> 00:51:14,710
dolla but but we have done a few things

918
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:16,779
um the first one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that we have</font>

919
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:20,140
finally finished our fixed point point

920
00:51:16,779 --> 00:51:22,180
of pv q so that had been going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

921
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:26,529
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a couple of meetings but is</font>

922
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:29,200
now done um we also ported<font color="#E5E5E5"> pvq over to</font>

923
00:51:26,529 --> 00:51:30,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">81 and so we had some interesting</font>

924
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,899
results there that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sheen's going to</font>

925
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:34,240
talk about in his presentation

926
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:37,930
afterwards so I won't spoil his his

927
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:40,058
thunder um uh the dollar<font color="#E5E5E5"> entropy coder</font>

928
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:43,598
had also previously been integrated into

929
00:51:40,059 --> 00:51:45,970
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> v1 is now the default arm and then</font>

930
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:49,240
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done several improvements to</font>

931
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:53,140
metrics and tools including all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

932
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:55,240
metrics now support 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> bits um and as I</font>

933
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:57,069
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the the discussion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

934
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:00,569
testing draft we found and fixed in

935
00:51:57,069 --> 00:52:02,770
overflow and fastest as I am next slide

936
00:52:00,569 --> 00:52:05,470
so let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one a little</font>

937
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:07,390
bit more um basically there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an</font>

938
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:10,689
integer overflow that<font color="#CCCCCC"> only affected</font>

939
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:12,549
frame sizes of 1080p or larger and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

940
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:14,170
did our initial validation of fastest as

941
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:15,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">I am we did it on our still image test</font>

942
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:19,599
sets which are just small enough not to

943
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:22,270
trigger it um but it does however

944
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:24,309
include some videos in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntt short one</font>

945
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:26,259
which was the set of test sequences that

946
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:28,180
we use to report most of our historical

947
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:34,690
results so all those numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been</font>

948
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:36,460
wrong um next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the the</font>

949
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:38,589
slide I'm sure most people here have

950
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:41,520
seen before on this is the previously

951
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:43,960
reported numbers for for fast ms ssim

952
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:46,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">for dolla at various points in time</font>

953
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:48,819
compared to h.265 and if you go to the

954
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:53,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">next slide that's the corrected version</font>

955
00:52:48,819 --> 00:52:55,288
arm the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one other difference between</font>

956
00:52:53,289 --> 00:52:58,420
this slide and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> previous one is that</font>

957
00:52:55,289 --> 00:53:00,010
x265 got upgraded from<font color="#E5E5E5"> version 1.8 to</font>

958
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,730
version 2.1 on our testing

959
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,890
infrastructure

960
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:04,870
so we have the new numbers are<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

961
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:07,900
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of x265 and that's why you</font>

962
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:10,180
see that red curve there has changed a

963
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,710
little bit but most of the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

964
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:13,029
numbers just got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit worse at</font>

965
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:18,370
the high end but the overall story

966
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:20,260
didn't change very much all right arm we

967
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:22,810
have also started measuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> dalla with</font>

968
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:26,710
the new testing methodology in the

969
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:28,420
testing draft so next slide on so this

970
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:31,960
measures with fewer points and on a

971
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:34,450
different set of test sequences and so

972
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:37,390
as you can see when we do this i'm also

973
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:40,080
using regular MSS as I am as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned</font>

974
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:43,089
before instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fastest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as I am armed</font>

975
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:45,960
you get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> results here where there is</font>

976
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:50,800
a bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a larger gap between us and</font>

977
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:52,900
x265 arm so that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has more</font>

978
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,670
to do with the set of test sequences

979
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:58,360
than it does the switch from fastest as

980
00:53:54,670 --> 00:54:03,280
I am to MSS I am if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the PSN</font>

981
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:05,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">rh vs numbers next slide we still come</font>

982
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">out a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit ahead way up at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

983
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:09,490
high<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit rate range but there is also</font>

984
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:12,460
again a significant gap between us<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

985
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:17,140
x265 on this set of test sequences um

986
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:19,500
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can't accuse us of picking</font>

987
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:24,430
our test conditions to make us<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

988
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:26,590
um overall since Berlin we've had about

989
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:29,560
60 commits the encoder has gotten

990
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:32,950
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> sixty-nine percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> faster and</font>

991
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:35,680
and we've had fairly small improvements

992
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:40,569
in berate um most of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

993
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:43,660
result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the the pv q work right next</font>

994
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:46,990
slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so these are a bit more</font>

995
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:49,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">details about the various changes as I</font>

996
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:51,970
said fixed point p BQ is now finished

997
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:54,790
that was 27 of the 60 commit so about

998
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:56,859

we're not planning to fix that<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time</font>

1006
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:17,170
up using floats

some platforms<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because when we do</font>

1008
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:21,819
our do is actually very convenient if

1009
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,529
the hardware has a fast reciprocal

always<font color="#E5E5E5"> um next slide this is what I was</font>

Mike again on the the the framework that

1019
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:52,150
you use for your ear<font color="#CCCCCC"> cindy optimization</font>

1020
00:55:50,109 --> 00:55:54,460
at one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> where were you looking at</font>

1021
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:56,230
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> intrinsics or do you do end up</font>

1022
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:59,290
moving to something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else or roll your</font>

1023
00:55:56,230 --> 00:56:01,359
own on so at the moment we're mostly

1024
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:04,750
just using raw intrinsic directly for

1025
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:06,339
every platform um we did look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

1026
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:09,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">Thor intrinsics and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we had a</font>

1027
00:56:06,339 --> 00:56:11,770
patch from Steiner and and we had a

1028
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:13,750
bunch of review comments on it and I

1029
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:15,369
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> those were never addressed so we</font>

1030
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:19,540
never landed it never converted all our

1031
00:56:15,369 --> 00:56:22,030
stuff um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I think we'd be okay</font>

1032
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:24,069
with using an approach like that um but

1033
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:26,260
it's not currently integrated<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1034
00:56:24,069 --> 00:56:27,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I was going to say maybe a it</font>

1035
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:29,920
may be good for a smaller team to figure

1036
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:32,140
out what the best what the best

1037
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,450
intrinsic approach is and<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially if</font>

1038
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:37,210
we can get the lift of supporting a

1039
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:39,730
bunch of platforms with a common library

1040
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:42,730
and and with the recent work for a

1041
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:44,700
256-bit that beat that would be good and

1042
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:48,400
if you guys have<font color="#E5E5E5"> already done work for</font>

1043
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:51,879
float<font color="#E5E5E5"> cindy that might also be good if</font>

1044
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:53,170
you could somehow you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess you</font>

1045
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably have totally different routines</font>

1046
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:57,579
forget the intrinsic right so totally

1047
00:56:55,270 --> 00:57:00,609
different routines for your float versus

1048
00:56:57,579 --> 00:57:03,730
a fixed point implementations right um

1049
00:57:00,609 --> 00:57:06,250
so well to be clear you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this is</font>

1050
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:09,970
this is work we have not actually done

1051
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:12,000
yet umm so so there's basically no Cindy

1052
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:14,859
in the actual pvq code at the moment um

1053
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,119
but you know we know how the instruction

1054
00:57:14,859 --> 00:57:19,529
sets works and we know how we would

1055
00:57:16,119 --> 00:57:23,650
write it if we went down that path arm

1056
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:26,589
so so like we have not actually done a

1057
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:28,030
fast RTO search using the reciprocal

1058
00:57:26,589 --> 00:57:31,090
square root<font color="#E5E5E5"> proxima shins in</font>

1059
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:32,950
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSE so all of the pv q work both</font>

1060
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:36,880
fixed point and floating point is still

1061
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:39,970
nonce md correct oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that might</font>

1062
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:47,470
explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the 20x worse it does</font>

1063
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:49,540
explain a chunk<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it yes um so we also</font>

1064
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:53,160
made some algorithmic improvements to

1065
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:55,750
PDQ encoder speed since as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Malouda to on</font>

1066
00:57:53,160 --> 00:58:00,250
porting pvq to other<font color="#CCCCCC"> contexts has in</font>

1067
00:57:55,750 --> 00:58:03,190
fact been quite slow arm so we are now

1068
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:06,310
using an approximate an approximate rate

1069
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:08,860
for making our do decisions and we also

1070
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:11,500
spent some time improving that rate this

1071
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:13,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">is instead of explicitly encoding the</font>

1072
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:16,540
actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual code words and then</font>

1073
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:20,890
counting up all the bits arm so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1074
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:23,860
by default off in in<font color="#CCCCCC"> dalla but on in a</font>

1075
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:25,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">v1 and it this was about a point three</font>

1076
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:30,040
percent regression but was much faster

1077
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:32,049
arm and so for the next stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

1078
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:35,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if everyone remembers exactly all</font>

1079
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:37,450
the details of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> PDQ works but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

1080
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:40,300
these two parameters gain and theta

1081
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:42,370
which are sort of of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know somewhat</font>

1082
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:45,430
perceptually meaningful parameters gain

1083
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:47,710
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of contrast and theta is</font>

1084
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:51,640
is how much like the predictor you are

1085
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:54,580
armed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so when we quantize those we</font>

1086
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:56,560
consider several different candidates um

1087
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:58,420
basically rounding up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then rounding</font>

1088
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:00,549
down and then going slightly beyond

1089
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:04,600
routing down just for our do purposes

1090
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:07,240
and from the given value of gain and

1091
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:12,880
theta we compute this this code book

1092
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:14,799
size<font color="#CCCCCC"> k arm which is is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the l1</font>

1093
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,720
norm of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the resulting coefficient vector</font>

1094
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:19,090
you're going to code and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the larger</font>

1095
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:21,060
that is um the more bits you have to

1096
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:23,350
spend coding that coefficient vector um

1097
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:24,940
so when we do all this we consider

1098
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:28,960
several all these different candidates

1099
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:32,800
arm and at the end in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speed</font>

1100
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:35,770
that up we now sort arm the different

1101
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:38,620
gain and theta candidates by this this

1102
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:41,920
value<font color="#CCCCCC"> K so that when we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do our code book</font>

1103
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:46,299
search we can reuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous results</font>

1104
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:47,650
just add more pulses on to the previous

1105
00:59:46,299 --> 00:59:51,759
vector instead of starting our search

1106
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:53,859
from scratch each time um so we also get

1107
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:56,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">to skip the search entirely when when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> K</font>

1108
00:59:53,859 --> 00:59:59,770
is the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> for different gain and theta</font>

1109
00:59:56,319 --> 01:00:01,950
candidates arm so this this in addition

1110
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:04,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">to being faster also gave us a small</font>

1111
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:10,689
less than point<font color="#E5E5E5"> one percent improvement</font>

1112
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:12,520
on be rate um and then finally any gain

1113
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:14,319
and theta candidate they can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibly</font>

1114
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:16,960
have a lower distortion than just the

1115
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:19,420
skip candidate we don't bother to

1116
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:21,910
actually search anymore um so that's

1117
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:23,799
assuming you know given given the

1118
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:25,868
distortion introduced by quantizing gain

1119
01:00:23,799 --> 01:00:27,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> theta assuming the distortion</font>

1120
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:30,430
introduced by quantizing all the

1121
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:32,980
coefficients is exactly zero and some

1122
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:34,660
minimum rate over what the the rate we

1123
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:37,569
would have to code for skip if all that

1124
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:41,049
is is still worse than doing skip then

1125
01:00:37,569 --> 01:00:42,910
then we just don't look at it and said

1126
01:00:41,049 --> 01:00:44,500
that that has no metrics change because

1127
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:47,740
we're you know not considering that

1128
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:51,970
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can't possibly help next</font>

1129
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:55,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">slide um we also made a number of</font>

1130
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:57,490
changes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the drinking filter um these</font>

1131
01:00:55,180 --> 01:01:00,790
have actually all been changed in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> v1</font>

1132
01:00:57,490 --> 01:01:03,759
but not ported back to daala yet um so

1133
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:06,880
the first one we use a shorter five type

1134
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:08,619
filters for chroma um so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look in</font>

1135
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:12,099
objective one fast there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

1136
01:01:08,619 --> 01:01:14,049
particular sequence minecraft where we

1137
01:01:12,099 --> 01:01:17,230
were showing fairly large regressions by

1138
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:18,880
turning you bringing on and so using the

1139
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:21,670
shorter filters makes those regressions

1140
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,650
go away on the overall changes for the

1141
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:27,670
the chrominance metric<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mentioned</font>

1142
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:29,109
earlier CI ed was very tiny calm so we

1143
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:30,549
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose any quality and chroma</font>

1144
01:01:29,109 --> 01:01:33,609
anywhere else by using these shorter

1145
01:01:30,549 --> 01:01:36,069
filters and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shorter filters are</font>

1146
01:01:33,609 --> 01:01:40,990
basically just because chromophore 20 is

1147
01:01:36,069 --> 01:01:43,270
subsampled um we also now support for 22

1148
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:46,868
input um but we did that by just

1149
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:49,000
disabling chroma d ringing um so we

1150
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:51,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was preferable than trying</font>

1151
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something more complicated the</font>

1152
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:55,700
main issue being since our<font color="#E5E5E5"> during filter</font>

1153
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:59,570
is directional

1154
01:01:55,700 --> 01:02:01,819
if you if you subsample<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2422 the</font>

1155
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:03,800
directions in the chroma plane don't

1156
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:05,480
line up with the directions in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> luma</font>

1157
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,369
plane unless you stretch things and

1158
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:10,490
stretching things was as I said

1159
01:02:07,369 --> 01:02:13,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">complicated so instead we just disable</font>

1160
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:15,799
it um but you know that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> chromo</font>

1161
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:20,690
slightly worse<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4422 but if you care</font>

1162
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:22,490
about that you should use<font color="#E5E5E5"> 444 arm we</font>

1163
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:26,060
also simplified the threshold

1164
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:29,328
calculation for the second filter arm so

1165
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:31,670
this used to be based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount of</font>

1166
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:34,700
change in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the co-located pixel in the</font>

1167
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:36,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">first filter and instead we now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> based</font>

1168
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:39,319
the threshold on the total change made

1169
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:41,060
by the first filter so in that second

1170
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,859
filter we no longer need to look up what

1171
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:44,810
the change was on a pretty cool basis

1172
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:48,348
and so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> saves a bit of computation</font>

1173
01:02:44,810 --> 01:02:51,650
um and it was a tiny regression but i

1174
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:53,060
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of computation it</font>

1175
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:55,300
saved in the decoder side was

1176
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:58,549
significantly larger than the the

1177
01:02:55,300 --> 01:03:01,640
regression on the metrics so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought</font>

1178
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:10,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was a good simplification next</font>

1179
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:13,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">slide sure Mulligan from the floor I'm</font>

on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your 42 comment I'm a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> confused</font>

1181
01:03:13,819 --> 01:03:20,359
about what happened there because I

1182
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:23,868
would think that you know anything

1183
01:03:20,359 --> 01:03:26,598
sensitive to the size of the block would

1184
01:03:23,869 --> 01:03:27,650
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> impacted by 42 and so I think not you</font>

1185
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:29,990
wouldn't change the size of the block

1186
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:31,880
you just have more blocks you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

1187
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:34,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">about to chroma block you know four</font>

1188
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:36,230
corner blocks instead of two um the

1189
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:38,210
problem is not the size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the blocks</font>

1190
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:40,579
the problem is the direction of the

1191
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:42,490
filter so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way the way it currently</font>

1192
01:03:40,579 --> 01:03:45,170
works is that we estimate on the

1193
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:48,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">dominant orientation on the luma plane</font>

1194
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:52,060
and then reuse that orientation for the

1195
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:55,250
chroma planes and so we support eight

1196
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:58,940
orientations in the luma plane and if

1197
01:03:55,250 --> 01:04:00,920
you now go take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to chroma because</font>

1198
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:03,440
the chroma is only subsampled and one

1199
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:05,540
access your directions get stretched

1200
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,520
well II the diagonal directions get

1201
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:08,759
stretched but but don't you look at the

1202
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,470
actual

1203
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,150
block not the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> plane you're just</font>

1204
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:13,950
looking at block by block right correct

1205
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:15,540
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't you just use to difference</font>

1206
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:19,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to separate chroma blocks with two</font>

1207
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:20,430
separate coatings for that well that

1208
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:23,100
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would mean you'd have to do a</font>

1209
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:24,569
direction search on chroma you have to

1210
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:26,100
do two directions searches on chroma

1211
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:27,600
currently we only do one direction

1212
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:31,410
search on lumen reuse it for all three

1213
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:33,450
planes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but I would think you could</font>

1214
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:35,970
still take that one and use it on the

1215
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:37,950
two separate blocks independently

1216
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:39,629
because those blocks are square if you

1217
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:40,710
look at two<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them that rectangular if</font>

1218
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:42,660
you combine<font color="#E5E5E5"> them into one but they're</font>

1219
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:45,210
square if you look at two<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them right</font>

1220
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:48,330
but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you find something that</font>

1221
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:50,790
has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 45-degree angle in luma then it</font>

1222
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:54,440
has it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have a 45 degree angle</font>

1223
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:58,650
in chroma when you do for 22 so sampling

1224
01:04:54,440 --> 01:05:00,060
right it's either 22 and a half or do

1225
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:03,240
you know depending on which 45-degree

1226
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:05,370
angle you talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so so we'd have</font>

1227
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come up with with a whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of</font>

1228
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:11,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> filter filter step sizes and</font>

1229
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:13,319
directions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look up tables just to</font>

1230
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:14,730
handle the 422 case to make the

1231
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:16,920
directions match what the actual

1232
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:17,880
direction was found in luma<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

1233
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:20,700
just didn't seem worth the extra

1234
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:22,140
complexity so the reason I i I'm not

1235
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:24,120
that sensitive about the about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1236
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:26,100
particular filter but just wonder 4422

1237
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:28,230
in general seems like all the coding

1238
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:31,259
tools that are sensitive<font color="#CCCCCC"> to size would</font>

1239
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:33,920
have this similar issue right on I think

1240
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:39,030
it's not so much size as it is direction

1241
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:41,700
um and so so at least in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> v1 for</font>

1242
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:44,100
example like inter modes are directional

1243
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:46,109
but Derek's but the chroma plane has a

1244
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:48,060
separately coded entry mode than<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1245
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:49,920
the luma plane so it doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1246
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:51,450
issue the problem here is we're trying

1247
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">to reuse something from the little plane</font>

1248
01:05:51,450 --> 01:05:55,799
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the crumble planes that is</font>

1249
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:57,870
directional and it didn't seem worth

1250
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:59,250
worth trying to do the conversion to

1251
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:02,069
account for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that the directions</font>

1252
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:05,070
all get skewed<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even Thor had the</font>

1253
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:07,830
chroma from a prediction and in the last

1254
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:08,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was presented it seems like</font>

1255
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:11,040
even that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a problem for things</font>

1256
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:14,009
like 42 if you want to use predictors

1257
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:16,050
directly um yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wind up having</font>

1258
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:18,570
to you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever your subsampling is</font>

1259
01:06:16,050 --> 01:06:19,620
has to account for that correctly you

1260
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:22,030
should make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> the requirements said</font>

1261
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:24,580
don't support 42

1262
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:33,880
I would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the requirements to say</font>

1263
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:36,130
that um anyway next slide arm so we also

1264
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:39,310
did some significant optimization work

1265
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:41,290
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> drain filter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a v1 um so we</font>

1266
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:43,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">ported over all the sindhi code for D</font>

1267
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:45,850
ringing from<font color="#CCCCCC"> dela um we also greatly</font>

1268
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:49,450
reduce the amount of copying and

1269
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:51,250
buffering um and this is so one we<font color="#E5E5E5"> made</font>

1270
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:54,460
the buffer smaller and we eliminated

1271
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:56,590
some of the buffer copies um but in fact

1272
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:58,690
the largest improvements were actually

1273
01:06:56,590 --> 01:07:00,460
from getting better cache coherency in

1274
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:03,160
the way that we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> managed these things</font>

1275
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:04,810
um so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think actually if you do an</font>

1276
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:06,609
inter frame you wind up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

1277
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:10,960
copying but since it's all out of cash

1278
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:12,670
it's still faster arm we also stopped

1279
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,290
running at all on blocks where the

1280
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:17,070
threshold was<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it couldn't</font>

1281
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:19,750
actually do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything to those blocks um</font>

1282
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:22,540
and overall the decoder speed impact

1283
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:25,390
went from around fifty percent of the

1284
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:29,350
decoder time without d ringing to down

1285
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:30,609
to 8.5 um so three-point-two percent of

1286
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:34,060
that is for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual filter</font>

1287
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:36,070
calculations and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5.3 percent is still</font>

1288
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:39,130
buffering and copying and managing

1289
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:40,530
things like skip flags um so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1290
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:43,120
there's still room for improvement there

1291
01:07:40,530 --> 01:07:45,850
none of the buffer copies are<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cindy and</font>

1292
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:49,720
you know d ringing is currently done in

1293
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:52,150
an entirely separate pass so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

1294
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:54,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">be done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that could be combined with the</font>

1295
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:56,290
blocking to even further reduce cache

1296
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:58,810
misses so we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's room to move</font>

1297
01:07:56,290 --> 01:08:00,810
that number down<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how much</font>

1298
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:07,360
effort will invest into doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font>

1299
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:10,090
it's certainly possible slide um just

1300
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:12,400
small updates on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> queue 15 entropy</font>

1301
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:15,040
encoder adaptation that we discussed in

1302
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">Berlin um basically wrote it down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1303
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:18,609
this draft if you have questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1304
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:20,980
how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works see I encourage you to go</font>

1305
01:08:18,609 --> 01:08:22,150
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and give us comments um we</font>

1306
01:08:20,979 --> 01:08:24,250
showed it to some of our hardware

1307
01:08:22,149 --> 01:08:28,240
partners no one had any heartburn about

1308
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:30,010
it so that seems good arm we still may

1309
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:31,899
change and improve exactly how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1310
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:34,900
works going forward so I think Thomas

1311
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:35,769
Davies of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco was was conducting some</font>

1312
01:08:34,899 --> 01:08:37,500
experiments that

1313
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:40,660
modified how this adaptation worked

1314
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:46,770
which gave some some coding gains so

1315
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:48,700
that was encouraging next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1316
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:52,660
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're we're planning to go</font>

1317
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:55,380
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> here arm so right now the PDQ</font>

1318
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:57,549
integration into a v1 was just done for

1319
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:59,470
optimizing for PSN are with flat

1320
01:08:57,549 --> 01:09:02,140
quantization so we had no activity

1321
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:04,420
masking and nothing else um and that's

1322
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:06,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">just to make sure that you know we were</font>

1323
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:08,500
sure that that the basic integration was

1324
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:11,260
working correctly you know walk before

1325
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:12,760
you can run<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so obviously the next</font>

1326
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:15,580
step is to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> turning on some of</font>

1327
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:17,950
these perceptual tools arm we've also

1328
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:21,399
been been working on further tuning for

1329
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:23,290
visual quality on inside dolla and I

1330
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:24,519
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were seeing seeing something on</font>

1331
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:28,810
the order of two to three percent

1332
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:31,870
improvements on on visual metrics um in

1333
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:34,330
dolla but that work has not actually

1334
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:36,430
landed yet and at when it does landon

1335
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:41,140
dollar then we'll port it over at AV one

1336
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:43,569
arm so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have basic pvq into a</font>

1337
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:47,710
v1 we can start porting over chroma from

1338
01:09:43,569 --> 01:09:51,250
luma um and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also plan to pour it over</font>

1339
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:52,870
dollars rate control um I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that</font>

1340
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:54,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that we already have ported</font>

1341
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:57,220
over to a v1 you know some of this is

1342
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:58,630
still pretty preliminary so there's a

1343
01:09:57,220 --> 01:10:00,270
bunch of work to do to improve the

1344
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:05,140
integration with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the codec</font>

1345
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:09,190
um and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that's it anybody have</font>

1346
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:12,940
any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> stat line is calling from</font>

1347
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:16,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cisco um you mentioning crow a chroma</font>

1348
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:20,710
from luma I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something</font>

1349
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:22,810
similar using the Thor Thor tool to get

1350
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:26,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that over in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 81 but I gave up on that</font>

1351
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:30,130
because you have can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

1352
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:33,549
prediction modes for chroma in luma and

1353
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:39,730
chroma is that a problem for the chroma

1354
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:43,020
from luma in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Palo arm so i think yes and</font>

1355
01:10:39,730 --> 01:10:45,790
no arm I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to have</font>

1356
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:47,890
different prediction modes for luma and

1357
01:10:45,790 --> 01:10:49,170
chroma depending on on how you want to

1358
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:50,699
go about integrating it

1359
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:52,949
so we're actually considering a number

1360
01:10:50,699 --> 01:10:57,870
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different options one is to just add</font>

1361
01:10:52,949 --> 01:11:01,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">CFL as an extra prediction mode on 44</font>

1362
01:10:57,870 --> 01:11:03,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">chroma um so we just be explicitly coded</font>

1363
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:06,120
as one more mode in the list of modes um

1364
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:08,280
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember correctly the stuff you</font>

1365
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:10,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">were doing with or tried to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure this</font>

1366
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:11,489
out automatically without signal yeah

1367
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:14,370
that's not a thing nothing so that is

1368
01:11:11,489 --> 01:11:17,610
why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get to problem right so so yeah</font>

1369
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:19,590
one solution is you signaling um the

1370
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:21,480
other thing we were considering is is is

1371
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:25,050
just removing all the other modes and

1372
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:29,190
only using CFL um at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> 44 inter</font>

1373
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:32,989
frames and and that worked reasonably

1374
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:37,469
well in<font color="#CCCCCC"> dalla in the sense that that arm</font>

1375
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:39,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">cfl using CFO for everything works</font>

1376
01:11:37,469 --> 01:11:42,600
slightly worse than actually trying to

1377
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:44,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">use real intro you have explicitly coded</font>

1378
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:45,660
integer prediction modes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we</font>

1379
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:47,040
didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pay the cost for</font>

1380
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:50,250
signaling what the prediction mode was

1381
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:52,290
so overall came out about even<font color="#E5E5E5"> um but</font>

1382
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:56,219
because we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do on a mode</font>

1383
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:57,690
search it was much faster um so we're

1384
01:11:56,219 --> 01:11:59,910
gonna try repeating that set of

1385
01:11:57,690 --> 01:12:09,089
experiments in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> v1 and see which way</font>

1386
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:14,630
things come out all right any<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

1387
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:14,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions great thank you</font>

1388
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:29,930
hello my name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you Shinjo I'm from</font>

1389
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:32,719
Dallas team in Missoula so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

1390
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:35,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about our experience in applying</font>

1391
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:40,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">pdq outside Allah actually the codec is</font>

1392
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:42,590
avian codec by<font color="#E5E5E5"> aon next one so for recap</font>

1393
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:44,570
dispute is actually a perceptual vector

1394
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:48,620
quantization which is already probe

1395
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:51,349
proposed for net pc and also it is only

1396
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:54,980
used for dollar codec and we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1397
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:57,560
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how it is doing outside dolla so</font>

1398
01:12:54,980 --> 01:13:00,169
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically gain shaped coding of</font>

1399
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:04,180
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> transcription</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's like the</font>

1400
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:06,470
opposite<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say the most</font>

1401
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:08,810
distinguishing idea of this pubic reach

1402
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:11,780
the way is referencing referencing the

1403
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:15,530
predictor so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also a big</font>

1404
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:17,570
difference from the p BQ in op asleep

1405
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:21,380
you clean<font color="#E5E5E5"> office is called pure 8 vector</font>

1406
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:23,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">quantization quantizer so briefly</font>

1407
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:26,510
typically does not use any subtraction

1408
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:29,089
when he is using predictors so substrate

1409
01:13:26,510 --> 01:13:31,370
subtraction is actually big basically

1410
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:34,730
difference between victory and original

1411
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:38,210
signal next time oh good question and

1412
01:13:34,730 --> 01:13:42,019
just to clarify<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of motivation</font>

1413
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:43,520
for this was other worlds beyond just

1414
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:44,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">compression quality right you were</font>

1415
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,950
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be some of the other</font>

1416
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:49,639
objectives in our charter<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font>

1417
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:53,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">royalty-free part huh okay the goal is</font>

1418
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:55,460
that to<font color="#CCCCCC"> avoid a lot of patents doing</font>

1419
01:13:53,930 --> 01:14:00,080
something different in the prediction

1420
01:13:55,460 --> 01:14:02,810
space to avoid subtracting and residuals

1421
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:04,370
and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so even if any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Q</font>

1422
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:06,680
doesn't give a quality game there may be

1423
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:11,330
some advantage to looking at it for the

1424
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:16,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">IP aspects yeah actually honest I was</font>

01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:16,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">not sure whether I can say the IPL</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

1426
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:21,889
the motivation I mean we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't give a</font>

1427
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:23,570
judgment on it but the motivation of it

1428
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:25,610
motivation of the work was not purely

1429
01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:28,330
for just gains right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually my</font>

1430
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:30,969
best location

1431
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:34,090
if there's no current<font color="#CCCCCC"> banner I mean</font>

1432
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:37,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">coding gain improvement actually just</font>

1433
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:41,620
avoiding I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk free for IPL stands</font>

1434
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:47,040
probably is a very large benefit and

1435
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:47,040
then we can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to next slide please so</font>

1436
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:53,800
there's another slide that some diagram

1437
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:57,670
which shows what is the actually

1438
01:14:53,800 --> 01:15:01,140
difference in architecture but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

1439
01:14:57,670 --> 01:15:05,010
if you want to use this p BQ you have to

1440
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:07,570
apply transform to the predictor<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell</font>

1441
01:15:05,010 --> 01:15:09,670
because the pittock is actually

1442
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:15,910
referencing the predictor in transform

1443
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:19,300
domain and also the original signal need

1444
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:21,849
be represented in transform domain so

1445
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:24,940
different from traditional video codec

1446
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:28,720
where the transform is applied to reg

1447
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:32,469
the signal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> PDQ the transform is</font>

1448
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:35,620

1449
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:37,660
mentioned the activity masking automatic

01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:41,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">activist activity masking which is</font>

1451
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:46,900
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice Mary the PDQ which is</font>

1452
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:50,290
not enabled yet so the whole the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldo</font>

1453
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:54,820
decision optimizing the college's solely

1454
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:57,190
based on psu now next slide so this is

1455
01:15:54,820 --> 01:16:00,000
diagram for traditional architecture

1456
01:15:57,190 --> 01:16:03,190
focusing on transform and quantization

1457
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:06,070
so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see the residue signal is</font>

1458
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:08,460
coming from the subtraction so

1459
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:11,679
difference between implant predictor and

1460
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:17,520
the transform is exactly applied to

1461
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:17,520
Reggie signal and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're quantized</font>

1462
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:21,850
symbols actually going through

1463
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:23,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">coefficient coder and there's a</font>

1464
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:28,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">bitstream generally next next slide</font>

1465
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:31,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">please however in however with p BQ</font>

1466
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:34,540
applied in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> b1 the difference is that</font>

1467
01:16:31,810 --> 01:16:38,440
you have at your additional transform up

1468
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:40,740
there which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> applied to predictor p so</font>

1469
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,799
we have two signals from two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1470
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:45,160
transformation

1471
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:49,720
p of x and t FP there's a lot out there

1472
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:51,910
and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pv q quantizer need to</font>

1473
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:55,540
input one is transformed input another

1474
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:57,610
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is transformed predictor so also</font>

1475
01:16:55,540 --> 01:17:01,120
with p BQ it is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just about</font>

1476
01:16:57,610 --> 01:17:03,580
quantization but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's generated coach</font>

1477
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:06,450
the symbols are completely different

1478
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:09,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the traditional coder so its</font>

1479
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:13,800
coefficient coder is also very much

1480
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:16,480
different from traditional coders and

1481
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:20,590
then the inverse transform is actually

1482
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:23,919
applied to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> d quantized TRX next</font>

1483
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:26,800
slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> please and we have some research</font>

1484
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:28,900
about coding change according game and

1485
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:32,170
basically there's no need for<font color="#E5E5E5"> money so i</font>

1486
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:36,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">can say that i I'm just happy with this</font>

1487
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:39,220
i know i mean surprising changes here so

1488
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:42,070
at least for optimized with pierson-el

1489
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:46,240
we can actually directly replace the

1490
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:49,179
existing quantizer with<font color="#CCCCCC"> pv q just a</font>

1491
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:54,040
problem is that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very slow it very</font>

1492
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:57,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">very slow now for this result we have</font>

1493
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:58,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">used one of the test sequence set</font>

1497
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:17,799

01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:21,670
encoding next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide please back to speed</font>

1499
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:25,000
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason why there's a too much</font>

1500
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:29,170
slow die down is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> p</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decreased</font>

1501
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:32,230
self is actually searching a lot so

1502
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:35,620
compared to existing scalar quantization

1503
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:42,429
which has over when complexity the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pdq</font>

1504
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:45,240
is basically doing n square so also we

1505
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:49,720
have only used PDQ in dollar before but

1506
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:54,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">dallas I'll do search space is much much</font>

1507
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:55,570
smaller<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that of 81 so here's one</font>

1508
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:58,540
example when we

1509
01:18:55,570 --> 01:19:02,820
encode of just one frame first<font color="#E5E5E5"> frame of</font>

01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:05,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grandmarc qcif in inter frame mode</font>

1511
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:09,579
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a b1 is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> calling hundreds of times</font>

1512
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:11,320
more holes to the quantizer so the

1513
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:13,719
region is that dolla does not have

1514
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:16,210
interrupted prediction more like there

1515
01:19:13,719 --> 01:19:19,659
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 prediction mode in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a v1 or so</font>

1516
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:23,139
alien has different sizes transform and

1517
01:19:19,659 --> 01:19:28,210
types are different transport types or

1518
01:19:23,139 --> 01:19:30,429
furthermore the 81 allows the price firm

1519
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:32,980
size can be smaller than put a

1520
01:19:30,429 --> 01:19:36,520
prediction size the partition size so

1521
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:40,419
virtually the Avion is can be say

1522
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:46,199
thousand more calls to the contactors

1523
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:50,980
compared to dollar next slide please and

1524
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:55,089
this is actual counting how many times

1525
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:58,388
<font color="#CCCCCC">pantalla yours are called so again this</font>

1526
01:19:55,090 --> 01:20:02,199
is based on first friend on intra mode

1527
01:19:58,389 --> 01:20:05,650
and these the first column speed rebel

1528
01:20:02,199 --> 01:20:10,360
is actually the speed a cpu use option

1529
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:13,900
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> alien codec so five weeks fastest</font>

1530
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:18,940
one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this a slowest one but</font>

1531
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:22,000
best quality and this is actually number

1532
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:23,440
of calls are also useful developing

1533
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,679
proposed because they should be actually

1534
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:30,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">very close and second and third column</font>

1535
01:20:26,679 --> 01:20:32,170
is for cause a vm quantizer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1538
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:42,790
actually inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> PDQ point out here it is</font>

1539
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:45,429
calling a typical call<font color="#E5E5E5"> pink contacted</font>

1540
01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:47,530
for each band of the whole transfer

01:20:45,429 --> 01:20:49,090
block and then they can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font>

1542
01:20:47,530 --> 01:20:54,869
multiple times when including one

01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:58,300
transfer<font color="#E5E5E5"> bluff one thing probably you</font>

1544
01:20:54,869 --> 01:21:00,460
your question is from speed level<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 23</font>

1545
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:03,790
there's a big increase of the number of

1546
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:07,300
cold the region is that it starts to

1547
01:21:03,790 --> 01:21:09,250
allow the<font color="#CCCCCC"> click</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the transform size can</font>

1548
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:11,020
be smaller than prediction size

1549
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:14,950
so that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why there's a big</font>

1550
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:18,670
increase and then for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beyond codec the</font>

1551
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:23,070
skill<font color="#CCCCCC"> level 32</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the scene for</font>

1552
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:27,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">intra so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the erica the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

1553
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:30,580
more from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the for Mike again not the</font>

1554
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:32,140
speed levels that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> picked why did you</font>

1555
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:35,610
stop at<font color="#E5E5E5"> five it seems like you think</font>

1556
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:35,610
that higher speed levels are irrelevant

1557
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:45,760
we look I know there's a gr8 yeah so the

1558
01:21:43,450 --> 01:21:48,700
reason i ask is because currently chrome

1559
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:52,000
ships with vp9<font color="#E5E5E5"> running at seven and</font>

1560
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:53,860
eight<font color="#CCCCCC"> for real time oh yeah so if work</font>

1561
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,390
if we care about WebRTC implementations

1562
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:57,820
we should probably care about seven and

1563
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:59,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">eight so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe good to include those</font>

1564
01:21:57,820 --> 01:22:03,549
those numbers too yeah actually the

1565
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:05,259
testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> has high latency and real-time</font>

1566
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:07,720
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you're talking about</font>

1567
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:10,060
the real time real time yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real</font>

01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:17,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">time web RTC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use in chrome is seven and</font>

1569
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:21,760
eight Stan on me Julian is it possible

1570
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:25,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use some a faster approximation use</font>

1571
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:27,130
you during a mole decision and then the

1572
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:30,160
real thing on there in the final encode

1573
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:31,840
yeah I rhythm yes we believe that's

1574
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:33,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible engineering and we want that</font>

1575
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:36,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you can you're welcome to contribute</font>

1576
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:40,210
that part so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what about</font>

1577
01:22:36,970 --> 01:22:42,100
to do list so instead of calling the

1578
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:45,580
transform quantization for every

1579
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:47,710
decision pass up the dis audio huge if

1580
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:51,030
we have some nice aldi<font color="#CCCCCC"> Modell that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

1581
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:51,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cibola the time a lot</font>

1582
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:59,420
yeah Tim Theriault from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Missoula that</font>

1583
01:22:57,949 --> 01:23:01,280
that was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the changes i</font>

1584
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:03,290
mentioned in my presentation is that

1585
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:05,120
instead of actually doing entropy coding

1586
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:08,989
for all these things we can do a raid

1587
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:10,940
approximation arm which which helps them

1588
01:23:08,989 --> 01:23:17,480
to save some time for this for a very

1589
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:21,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">small quality penalty right next one</font>

1590
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:24,199
please so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some interesting</font>

1591
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:25,790
issues which is arising during this

1592
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:29,570
intervention work<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually this</font>

1593
01:23:25,790 --> 01:23:31,460
experiment one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1594
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:34,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure you have chance to see Peter key</font>

1595
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:39,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">code they actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> full of audio in</font>

1596
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:43,850
search stage so at least not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just choose</font>

1597
01:23:39,739 --> 01:23:46,940
one code point or vertex in a hyper

1598
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:48,770
hyper<font color="#E5E5E5"> stare hypersphere surface of the</font>

1599
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:53,690
hydrosphere but it has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1600
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:56,270
choose best quantization point in latest

1601
01:23:53,690 --> 01:23:59,570
version sense and then this somehow

1602
01:23:56,270 --> 01:24:02,570
affected I mean breaking the balance

1603
01:23:59,570 --> 01:24:03,679
between luma and chroma quality so we

1604
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:06,040
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually compare the quality</font>

1605
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:08,780
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> b-1 maybe this is not really</font>

1606
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:11,590
worse spending<font color="#CCCCCC"> time but we have spent</font>

1607
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:15,320
the ultimate spend several weeks to

1608
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:18,949
resolve issues issues so probably later

1609
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:22,639
if people is really adopted then this

1610
01:24:18,949 --> 01:24:25,699
can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's impossible issue another one</font>

1611
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:29,239
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a be one is using hybrid transform so</font>

1612
01:24:25,699 --> 01:24:33,349
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DCT and ECT but it it can</font>

1613
01:24:29,239 --> 01:24:35,839
use a DST so which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a synchronous or a</font>

1614
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:37,070
symmetric discrete sine transform so

1615
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:41,989
there are four<font color="#CCCCCC"> different types</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1616
01:24:37,070 --> 01:24:44,599
transform and then p BQ want scan orders

1617
01:24:41,989 --> 01:24:46,809
jig Jack's can orders for each band

1618
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:50,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually sell band up the transform</font>

1619
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:53,150
transfer block so we needed we need to

1620
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:56,179
define<font color="#E5E5E5"> their ones that we actually have</font>

1621
01:24:53,150 --> 01:25:01,740
some tool to convert from 81 scan order

1622
01:24:56,180 --> 01:25:05,760
to our purpose next slide

1623
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:08,410
and our future work will include

1624
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:11,800
enabling this automatic activity masking

1625
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:15,280
and then also need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enable the high</font>

1626
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:18,130
bit depths but as Steiner said this is

1627
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:23,290
very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> in word but is very large</font>

1628
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:28,780
work in source code and again this<font color="#E5E5E5"> audio</font>

1629
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:30,640
model will take the time a lot next

1630
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:34,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">slide I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is less fun oh yeah</font>

1631
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:37,510
so yeah reminder that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pitch was</font>

1632
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:44,110
originally proposed to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> nebbishy</font>

1633
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:48,570
last year summer ITF<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1634
01:25:44,110 --> 01:25:53,650
tehsil in Russian somersworth comment

1635
01:25:48,570 --> 01:25:55,450
you can speak in Korean excites

1636
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:59,019
encouraging you see it at the tool moved

1637
01:25:55,450 --> 01:26:00,130
from cross codex that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a i think is it</font>

1638
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:06,460
this is the first tool that we've seen

1639
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:17,350
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> cross codex dealing yeah okay the</font>

1640
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:20,890
deepening is also cool thank you very

1641
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:24,070
much thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that that takes us to</font>

1642
01:26:20,890 --> 01:26:25,690
the end of our planned agenda presuming

1643
01:26:24,070 --> 01:26:27,790
no one has<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone any additional items</font>

1644
01:26:25,690 --> 01:26:31,629
they want to discuss you're going to be

1645
01:26:27,790 --> 01:26:33,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the rest the afternoon off so thank</font>

1646
01:26:31,630 --> 01:26:35,380
you very much for showing up please make

1647
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:37,059
certain if you didn't put your<font color="#E5E5E5"> name on</font>

1648
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:39,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the blue sheets to go ahead and come up</font>

1649
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:46,710
here and do that otherwise have a good

1650
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:46,710
evening just in time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy hour yeah</font>

1651
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,920
ok
