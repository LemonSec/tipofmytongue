we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the document status as</font>

35
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:17,630

39
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:33,049
is the extended ping from Ron Eric with

45
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:53,330
comments or bashing to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda ok</font>

46
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,610
none so let's start with the status

47
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,840
updates so

48
00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:02,379
or the interior tunnels so we had the

49
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:05,080
some slides presented remotely from Joe

50
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:07,419
and Mark in Berlin since then there was

51
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,188
some discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the list about the</font>

52
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:12,159
status of the document whether this

53
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:14,439
should be informational or PCP and there

54
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:20,639
was I believe an update to the document

55
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:24,310
I don't see is his mark in the room he's

56
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:27,490
nuts<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so he was going to give a</font>

57
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:31,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">quick update to that so we'll skip it I</font>

58
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:33,430
guess until he shows up but we basically

59
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:35,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to advance that document I they</font>

60
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:38,080
think it's in a pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> condition</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

61
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:42,039
their intention would be to to move it

62
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:45,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward and again if Mark shows up we'll</font>

63
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:47,590
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> them give a one-minute update about</font>

64
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:50,620
it but otherwise please take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

65
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:54,400
10 comments if you have any other

66
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:56,500
documents we have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDF interior house</font>

72
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:24,550
comments uh Charlie do you hook you want

73
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:26,289
to say anything more<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so more</font>

74
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,110
updates calls for adoption we have a

75
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:30,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">couple the ITF entire broadcast</font>

76
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,250
consideration but Rawls is going to give

77
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:36,729
a comprehensive presentation about it

78
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:40,449
then we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the env 03 that we</font>

79
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:44,620
inherited now it's here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tom is going</font>

80
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:46,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to present and we have one announcement</font>

81
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:50,610
for my<font color="#CCCCCC"> tripoli which i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give</font>

82
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,610
you next<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

83
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:08,530
so last week there was the I Triple E

84
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:11,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">ADA to meeting and you may remember that</font>

85
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:14,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is this a specification called</font>

86
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:16,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">Omni run which defines a network</font>

87
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,120
architecture for I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tripoli 802</font>

88
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,770
technologies meaning something going a

89
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,380
little higher layer than what they

90
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:27,669
usually do defining an interconnection

91
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:29,890
of 802 technologies and we have a

92
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:35,110
coordination group between I Tripoli an

93
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:37,000
ietf this being a novel lap it was

94
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,400
decided that we should give an update

95
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,650
here in the internet about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the status of</font>

96
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:46,360
the of the specification so you can take

97
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,770
a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the others like there's a lot</font>

98
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,020
of details and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to concentrate</font>

99
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:52,270
on the last part but this is just a

100
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">reminder that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they are doing this is</font>

101
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,569
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a stage 2 if you are</font>

102
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:14,319
familiar with the terminology so it's an

103
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:16,060
architecture document so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

104
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,480
reference model for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an functional</font>

105
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:22,449
description important part is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope</font>

106
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,730
so the document specifies an arc access

107
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:27,580
network interconnecting terminals to the

108
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:31,830
access router so that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the important</font>

109
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:34,150
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a in this light a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> detailed</font>

110
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,620
description of the table of<font color="#CCCCCC"> contents in</font>

111
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:39,640
the information that it's right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now in</font>

112
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:42,280
the in the spec and the the scope is

113
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:45,010
basically the blue part and the lower

114
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,230
picture so connecting the terminal to

115
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the access router debate all the</font>

116
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:52,530
connectivity between the terminal and

117
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:54,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">access router the first top layer to</font>

118
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:59,319
envelope that's that's what the

119
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:01,089
specification is about again some basics

120
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,650
there there's a reference model some

121
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:05,860
interfaces that hadn't defined some

122
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:08,069
functionalities discovery subscription

123
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,420
and so on

124
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:14,650
there's more details<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the in the</font>

125
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:16,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">latest version where we also define</font>

126
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:20,590
network management coordination services

127
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,710
this is generic nomenclature but it maps

128
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:25,750
to basically a and<font color="#CCCCCC"> d SF or that those</font>

129
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:28,390
type of protocols that are used<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's in</font>

130
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:31,720
802 11 networks to discover what<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

131
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:33,640
services the network provides or there

132
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,140
could be like if you do white spaces

133
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:40,060
what kind of frequencies that are

134
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:41,830
available for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to connect so again</font>

135
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,790
describing a lot of details on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

136
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:47,590
composition of the functions the new

137
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">topic that they added is network</font>

138
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:51,730
virtualization so that's something that

139
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:56,050
it's also being hot in this in this

140
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:58,540
group the idea is a specifying the model

141
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:01,390
that allows network virtualization so

142
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,860
some mastic surface is en and nav and

143
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,550
how they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> applicable to raid 0</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

144
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,900
technologies and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why we're</font>

145
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,479
giving this announcement here is because

146
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:13,420
the the current draft is a little more

147
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:17,650
readable now it provides text for all

148
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:19,209
sections but still ongoing there's mean

149
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,880
some letter ballots which is like

150
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:25,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">internal calls in the group over there</font>

151
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:29,080
but now they are looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

152
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:32,410
expertise to provide comments and that's

153
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,990
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are presenting it here now the</font>

154
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:36,880
specification the way i triple e works

155
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,670
is this wouldn't be available<font color="#CCCCCC"> to anyone</font>

156
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,550
that is not a member<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group until</font>

157
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:45,010
is finished and published by i triple e

158
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,859
now because where they are asking for

159
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:51,580
input specifically form network experts

160
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:55,630
like here I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ETF there is a way and</font>

161
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:58,360
there's a an agreement between I Triple

162
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:01,360
E and IETF so if you are interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

163
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,610
reading this specification you have to

164
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,190
contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I Triple E 80 two dot one</font>

165
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:10,960
chair Glenn Parsons and there is the the

166
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:15,220
email so if you ask the chair as an ietf

167
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:17,830
member to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a copy he can unicast</font>

168
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,839
you a copy and that is ok with the

169
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,320
copyrights of I Triple E what is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

170
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,780
is to put it in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> public place that</font>

171
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:45,140
people can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it so that's it</font>

172
00:12:25,780 --> 00:13:00,740
thank you very much yep so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next so</font>

173
00:12:45,140 --> 00:13:04,730
tom<font color="#E5E5E5"> is done in the room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

174
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:25,250
me we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go to growth and then let</font>

175
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:27,470
Tom speak when he comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks I just</font>

176
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:30,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">start so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is about the privacy</font>

177
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,240
considerations document on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chest</font>

178
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,410
like you saw this is an adoption call

179
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,840
but it has already been adopted by the

180
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:42,260
working group I hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> not you have</font>

181
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:44,120
reverted the decision next item so the

182
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,130
they are just a quick recap where we

183
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,990
coming from the origin of this work is

184
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,270
basically we did experiments on not

185
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,920
wireless networks we did not our campus

186
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:54,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">network and we did it also here the ITF</font>

187
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,729
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of broadcast and</font>

188
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,890
multicast protocols a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

189
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,930
proprietary and what we could do with

190
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,670
that is we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify people their</font>

191
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:04,370
devices but we could also identify

192
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:07,670
groups of people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they share data</font>

193
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:10,270
and busy<font color="#E5E5E5"> build the social graph of the</font>

194
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:12,770
of the network I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> by looking at</font>

195
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:14,270
broadcast and multicast data that's

196
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,250
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not good because there's PII in</font>

197
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,949
there and a lot of other information and

198
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:21,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that justice it's not just harmful to</font>

199
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:24,350
the privacy of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's also bad</font>

200
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,480
for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that happen in in</font>

201
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">this organization but also not eyes</font>

202
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,720
deals for example mac address

203
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:32,480
randomization so if you randomize<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mac</font>

204
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,730
address but you have static identifiers

205
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,230
and broadcast protocols there's no use

206
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,490
in

207
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,680
in changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> your mac address because you</font>

208
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">will be identifiable I'm constantly next</font>

209
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">slide there's a paper if you want to see</font>

210
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:44,710
all the details so since the last

211
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,880
meeting the document has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopted by</font>

212
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:49,630
the working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this there were</font>

213
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:51,220
three revisions where we address mostly

214
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:53,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">meting this comments there's a couple of</font>

215
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,640
comments outstanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get to that but</font>

216
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,240
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them have been addressed and we</font>

217
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:00,250
extended the document content neck slide

218
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:03,400
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we did we edit examples</font>

219
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:05,320
and per request we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we never mentioned</font>

220
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,930
any company names or anything that that

221
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:11,740
use certain protocols in a weird way so

222
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:13,060
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> anonymous examples we add that</font>

223
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">a summary at the end of the document</font>

224
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:18,130
that summarizes all the considerations

225
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:19,720
in one spot it's just a bullet list it's

226
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,010
very brief that's to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point and it's</font>

227
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,320
the condensed form we thought that is

228
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful for the reader and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moved</font>

229
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,920
second secondary considerations to the

230
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,660
back of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the document for example that</font>

231
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,630
when you broadcast a lot admit also

232
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,980
means that frequently that devices

233
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,530
cannot go to sleep<font color="#CCCCCC"> and your own device</font>

234
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,540
cannot go to sleep<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that potentially</font>

235
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:40,390
drains batteries but that has nothing to

236
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:42,849
lose privacy's who removed it into a

237
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,350
separate section we also specify the

238
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">attacker more so we said it's a large</font>

239
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,430
receive a group by design so there's

240
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:50,439
large number of potential attackers and

241
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:52,030
somebody said well could you please add

242
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,520
that is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> unknown attacker so there's</font>

243
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:55,839
no way for you to also know who's

244
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,819
actually attacking or snooping on the

245
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,250
traffic because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're simply part of</font>

246
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:04,660
the land and we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we had a bunch</font>

247
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:07,630
of reference as well next slide so next

248
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:09,280
up with this document is there's two

249
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,450
comments that we aware of that we still

250
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,089
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to factor in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's one</font>

251
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:15,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion somebody wanted about the</font>

252
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:18,160
general usefulness of broadcast and

253
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:19,630
multicast<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we will add and</font>

254
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,310
that's another reference we should

255
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,750
include and the concepts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

256
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,250
that's something we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will add but</font>

257
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,480
basically from our perspective we are

258
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,920
done if there's more comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

259
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,840
group we were happy to receive those

260
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,339
comments and factor them in but other

261
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">than that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> finish up</font>

262
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:35,170
this document so expect one or two more

263
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:36,880
and releases and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we from our</font>

264
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,160
perspective or<font color="#CCCCCC"> down nameless you guys</font>

265
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,260
have more comments if you have any

266
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:47,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">comments now you can give them to me</font>

267
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:47,340
directly otherwise I'm done

268
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:54,719
Tim chain so this your document now site

269
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:59,240
the work<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christian and Daniel are doing</font>

270
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:03,810
in DNS SD with regards to privacy for

271
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:05,579
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening i guess not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might be a</font>

272
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:07,409
useful thing it looks very<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

273
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:10,139
works that's actually being discussed in

274
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:12,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">dns SD tomorrow so there's two drafts</font>

275
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,280
one describes the privacy issue and the

276
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:17,369
general framework for addressing it the

277
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:20,280
other describes a pairing protocol that

278
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:23,668
allows two devices to initiate initiate

279
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:27,209
a pairing and then when they communicate

280
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:32,070
using obfuscating names and they use<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns</font>

281
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:33,179
sorry they use TLS for mdns to get the

282
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">information so it looks quite</font>

283
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:37,470
encouraging so<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd encourage be a you</font>

284
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:39,629
to maybe reference that and be<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to</font>

285
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">come to dns SD tomorrow and discuss that</font>

286
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:48,990
if they're interested all right thank

287
00:17:40,919 --> 00:18:00,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">you good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> excellent thank you to stop not</font>

288
00:17:48,990 --> 00:18:08,070
in the room yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so Ron with the e</font>

289
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:10,580

<font color="#CCCCCC">ok first light ok let's say for a minute</font>

292
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,590
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> building a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> green field</font>

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,770

00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:25,230
sure let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a minute that you're</font>

295
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:28,470
building<font color="#CCCCCC"> a green field network you would</font>

00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:30,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">really like to use unnumbered interfaces</font>

297

on your point-to-point links between

298
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,168
routers or if it's v6 you'd like to

299
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,809
leave those with just link local

300
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:38,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">addresses and nothing better people</font>

301
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:40,620
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this the reason they</font>

302
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,659
don't is because they need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

303
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,000
ping an interface and it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard</font>

304
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:46,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">to ping an unnumbered interface or an</font>

305
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,380
interface that has only<font color="#E5E5E5"> link local</font>

306
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:53,610
addresses so<font color="#E5E5E5"> X ping to the rescue next</font>

307
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:56,549
slide okay um how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> X ping work well</font>

308
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,889
x things an application and it is not

309
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:00,200
only very similar to

310
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:03,050
it's a perfect analogue to ping it does

311
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,960
exactly what ping does it sends a probe

312
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:08,600
it waits for a response the probe

313
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,870
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an ICMP echo is an ICMP</font>

314
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:14,919
extended echo instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an echo</font>

315
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:20,330
response it's an extended echo response

316
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:23,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the interesting thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that X ping</font>

317
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:26,240
makes a distinction between the

318
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:28,939
destination interface and the probe to

319
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,740
interface the second bullet<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is the</font>

only important part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this presentation</font>

321
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,750
pay attention then go to sleep<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

322
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:38,330
rest of it um let's say for a moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

323
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:41,450
have a router it has a loopback address

324
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:44,659
that is globally reachable and it has a

325
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:47,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of unnumbered interfaces you send</font>

326
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:49,790
your echo to the destination address to

327
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,270
the loopback you send your echo to the

328
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:56,180
loopback and the echo has in it an

329
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:58,790
identifier to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you what interface</font>

330
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:01,010
you are probing now<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously it can't</font>

331
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,420
identify the probit interface by a dress

332
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:06,500
because the probed interface doesn't

333
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:11,210
have an address it identifies it by port

334
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:13,550
name or by<font color="#CCCCCC"> if' index or maybe by MAC</font>

335
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:16,280
address or maybe by link local address

336
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:19,940
it identifies at some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> way so you</font>

337
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:22,100
send up you send your echo your extended

338
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,510
echo message to the destination address

339
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,929
to the one that has a real global

340
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:31,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">address the echo message includes an</font>

341
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:33,890

00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:36,680
interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're probing and then the</font>

343
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:38,630

344
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:41,680
information about the probed interface

345
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:48,920
and not the destination interface anyhow

346
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:51,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay next slide gee okay let's talk</font>

347
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:57,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">about exactly how it works you send an</font>

348
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:59,419
ICMP message um the recipient of the

349
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,879
ICMP message determines whether the

350
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,500
queries well-formed whether the query

351
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,480
type is supported for instance if you

352
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,420
probed by name if it will answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

353
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:11,270
probe by name on whether the query

00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:13,130
uniquely identifies an interface

355
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:16,520
instance you might have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know tried</font>

356
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:18,920
to query by link local address but guess

357
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,810
what two interfaces on this router have

358
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,910
the same link local so it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell</font>

359
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:24,679
you whether and then finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going</font>

360
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:27,080
to tell you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> status of the probed</font>

00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:30,170

00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:33,770

364
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:38,060
status of the probed interface next

00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:39,500
slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we have an implementation</font>

366
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:43,250
this is what it looks like and this

367
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:45,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">should look vaguely familiar um the ex</font>

368
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:48,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">pain command looks kind of like paying</font>

369
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:50,570
except the command lines a little

370
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:53,200
different the minus<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tells you that I</font>

371
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:58,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">am probing the interface with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font>

for both<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 and ipv6 and they're both</font>

381
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:34,160
up at the moment next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here</font>

382
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:37,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">again we're doing the exact same thing</font>

383
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,830
except this time the probed interface is

384
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:44,960
identified by its ipv6 link local

385
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:49,429
address we sent and also notice that the

386
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:54,050
destination address you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 10 10</font>

387
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:56,150
dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 is an ipv4 address and the probed</font>

388
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:58,879

389
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:01,490
linked local it's perfectly legal for

390
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,320
that matter we we could have identified

391
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:06,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">the probed interface by its MAC address</font>

392
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:11,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">too or any other kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of address it</font>

393
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:14,630
might have had next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's a</font>

394
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:18,650
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what the ICMP extended echo</font>

395
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:20,690
looks like this looks phenomenally like

396
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:23,150
the old echo except you have an extent

397
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:25,000
extension structure at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of it</font>

398
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:29,150
next slide

399
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
um the extension extension structure has

400
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:35,030
this interface identifier object it

401
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,220
identifies the probed interface either

402
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:40,280
by name<font color="#CCCCCC"> I f index or address and we have</font>

403
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:43,130
a question and yes so i have to admit

404
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,780
haven't read the document but um so

405
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,190
irregular ping is nice because it gives

406
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,750
you reach ability information as well

407
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,640
right because you reach the address<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

408
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,580
you actually paint this is different

409
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:55,040
right so think about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a second</font>

410
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:57,980
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you with traditional ping do you</font>

411
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,290
have if you ping an interface and get a

412
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,480
response saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's up do you have any</font>

413
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:04,790
guarantee that the echo or the echo

414
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,340
reply actually traversed the ping<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

415
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,690
probed interface there's no guarantee

416
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,070
but if there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> guarantees no</font>

417
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">guarantee been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same here no</font>

418
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,929
guarantee well that says well<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font>

419
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,970
but but this is different because

420
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:19,130
they're you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it hasn't</font>

421
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">reverse DDT pink tint of it now might</font>

422
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,570
have you address a different it might

423
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:26,180
have might but you same probability

424
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,290
nobody this is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean the information</font>

425
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,430
you get is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same you get from the</font>

426
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,720

428
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,780
have I be 496 just that you send a

429
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,129
message and not log into the box but the

430
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,190
only different right the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

431
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:44,180
that's different<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is traditional</font>

432
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:46,460
ping tells you only<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether the protocol</font>

433
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,990
that you use to ping is up this one

434
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,970
tells you whether the protocol you use

435
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,470
to ping is up and it tells you about any

436
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:54,440
other protocols that are up on that

437
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:56,150
interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well yeah but also it's a</font>

438
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,690
little italy a little more in different

439
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:01,760
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a second question if you that's</font>

440

far<font color="#E5E5E5"> away i have a second question so and</font>

441
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,879
this also allows you something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else that</font>

442
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,280
you can do a thing because you can

443
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,750
basically try to it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of</font>

444
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,639
guesswork but you can try to figure out

445
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,890
all the interfaces that are up on that

446
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,350
from the outside that are up on that box

447
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:17,600
you can basically introspect the sales

448
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:21,290
yes but is slightly<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm a good party and</font>

449
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:24,439
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have an option to</font>

450
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:28,310
say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what on this box i'm not</font>

451
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:30,470

456
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,900
right but there's a security in case yes

457
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:48,550
there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security implication it's in</font>

458
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:54,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the security considerations section</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

459
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:56,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay next slide um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the the</font>

460
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:59,059
interface identifier object when you're

461
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,100
probing by address you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can probe by any</font>

462
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:02,750
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of address that's why we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have this</font>

defined you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can probe by it next slide</font>

467
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,330
okay the echo response looks

468
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:27,559
suspiciously like the old echo response

469
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:30,110
except it has an S bit and some protocol

470
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:31,700
flags the protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> Flags map to the</font>

471
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:36,290
protocols that might be running<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

472
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:41,320
box and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the SB so now I can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

473
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:43,730
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it what it tells you um oh</font>

474
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:55,370
it tells you that at least one protocol

475
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:57,020
is up on the box next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide okay ah ok</font>

476
00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:00,620
talk a little bit about error messages

477
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:02,929
um no error<font color="#CCCCCC"> X ping not enabled malformed</font>

478
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:05,689
query query type not enabled the

479
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:09,760
question about security came from here

480
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:14,090
if you are configured so you cannot

481
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:16,250
accept a probe say by interface name and

482
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,320
you probed by interface name you'll get

483
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:21,890
that error three this time type<font color="#E5E5E5"> of query</font>

484
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,960
isn't supported also there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> possibility</font>

485
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:26,170
there's no such interface and there's a

486
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,550
possibility that multiple interfaces

487
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:30,980
wouldn't it be better<font color="#E5E5E5"> to not send an</font>

488
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:33,350
arrow at all because now<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're telling</font>

489
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,790
the guy that's probing don't try this

490
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,669
try something else because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not</font>

491
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:41,450
working wouldn't even for that sooner or

492
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:42,410
later well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know because it</font>

493
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:47,840
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be another reason why you don't</font>

494
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:49,429
get a reply hmm let's discuss this more

495
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,870
often you also don't get from for ping

496
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:52,010
you don't get an error saying p not

497
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,510
enabled or something right

498
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,980
I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be convinced to that let's</font>

499
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,790
discuss<font color="#CCCCCC"> it more off list because I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

500
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:59,000
sure we have the time in this

501
00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:00,700
presentation de comer knows one

502
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,100
additional question on the security part

503
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:06,470
you you are able to to filter on what

504
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,240
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that reply at response or</font>

505
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,970
not but for example for anything that do

506
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,660
you provide a reply you<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide for</font>

507
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:16,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">example this ipv4 ipv6 up so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd you're</font>

508
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:19,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably information is dropping in with</font>

509
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:22,550
ipv4 do it bro information whether that

510
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,960
interface is running<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 36 or not as the</font>

511
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:26,930
draft is written now it doesn't matter

512
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">what what protocol you probe with you</font>

513
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:30,620
will hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all protocols running on</font>

514
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,450
the interface I could be convinced<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

515
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:34,280
maybe you should only answer regarding

516
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:40,130
the protocol you were probed with yeah

517
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:43,490
let's have that conversation um a couple

518
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:46,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions so this point if I understand</font>

519
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:52,060
this this is I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> bobien didn't this</font>

520
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:54,560
works in one node it works in one node

521
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:56,510
like regular thing you send it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a node</font>

522
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:59,120
the node answers well no but you're sort

523
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:00,890
of you're sending it to one address in a

524
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,939
node like a loopback yeah and then

525
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:04,130
you're getting information about

526
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">something else an interface yes that</font>

527
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:08,000
interface must be co-resident with the

528
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,129
probe didn't destination<font color="#CCCCCC"> addresses must</font>

529
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,670
be on the same note I mean this might be

530
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:15,950
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> also more interesting if you could</font>

531
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:18,350
use one node to probe another note that

532
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:20,390
doesn't have global scope I thought

533
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:22,399
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and then I thought this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

534
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:24,680
that would be a bigger job that might be

535
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,420
scope creep for me all I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to do</font>

536
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,430
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a ping for the unnumbered</font>

537
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:30,950
interface yes what you're suggesting is

538
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:34,880
a good idea but probably a different

539
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:39,230
project well this could easily the same

540
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:42,740
interface and the same you know CLI

541
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:43,940
command it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear anything would</font>

542
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,470
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change it would just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

543
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,000
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> slightly different if it</font>

544
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:49,880
wasn't a note on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BOK you would just</font>

545
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,040
send a packet to that address and it

546
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,190
you'd have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it could reach</font>

547
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:56,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">it uh-huh so let might think about it</font>

548
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:58,610
let's let my baby will discuss it

549
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:01,610
offline a little bit because is that is

550
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:03,530
an interesting idea and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you</font>

551
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:06,060
should pass this by six men because you

552
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:07,649
are changing icmpv6

553
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:14,399
are sending it or something oh yeah

554
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:16,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">absolutely okay okay um and finally a</font>

555
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,750
reminder about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> f it is I</font>

556
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">couldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remember that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> S field is</font>

557
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:23,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">set if the code is equal to no error and</font>

558
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:24,929
the probe dinner faces up protocol flags

559
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:28,560
indicate which protocols are running on

560
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:34,950
the interface next slide ah next slide

561
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:36,659
we ought gem and genuine coya I'm still

562
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:39,120
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my head around the use</font>

563
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,530
case because it's definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> not my use</font>

564
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,419
case for example because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was very</font>

565
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:45,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that i can just have a</font>

566
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:46,830
connectivity oh if interfaces up i most

567
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,930
likely will be pink in from neighboring

568
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,189
node because i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the link</font>

569
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,680
status oh I can get that information

570
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:56,070
another way right so but I assume

571
00:30:52,680 --> 00:31:01,050
someone might have a use case I still

572
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:03,450
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about specifying ipv6 address I</font>

573
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:07,649
would say if you specify link-local you

574
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:10,530
must include zone ID something to make

575
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:13,500
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique oh yeah lil coco make sense</font>

576
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:15,290
only if you specify a zone idea right

577
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,090
and the reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there might be two</font>

578
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:20,850
interfaces with the same link local yes

579
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:24,149
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if you spit to find</font>

580
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:28,679
v6 address you should allow including

581
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:31,380
the zone ID to that address because

582
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,090
link-local is out as on a meaningless

583
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:35,850
it's okay that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good point i'll catch</font>

584
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:38,790
that in the next trip and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i</font>

585
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:42,149
looked in there how you form replies ah

586
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:43,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">i said coming into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bob yeah who there</font>

587
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:47,550
are some requirements on how not

588
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:49,590
generates icmpv6 for example i finalized

589
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:51,629
right like you you choose not just copy

590
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:54,419
source to destination because it might

591
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:56,940
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> unspecified on multicast or something</font>

592
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:58,530
else<font color="#CCCCCC"> i should comply with I've got a</font>

593
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,750
good point there is a rule that<font color="#CCCCCC"> says</font>

594
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:02,160
that the source address of the reply has

595
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:04,800
to be the address of the interface

596
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:07,080
through which the reply left the box and

597
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,270
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically there are other references</font>

598
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,129
you might include the area okay good

599
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:17,490
point i<font color="#E5E5E5"> will catch that the next route</font>

600
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:19,800
and I was and yeah I think yeah

601
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:21,720
basically since its it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

602
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,700
let's run<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the yeah and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

603
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,700
like when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> sign it it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly like</font>

604
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,710
I seen p because in normal ahora play

605
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,970
you includes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a request completely and I</font>

606
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,610
think you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this in this case</font>

607
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:34,050
right no i<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

608
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:40,320
creeper you can adjust aside you cannot

609
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:44,700
place this size right well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yes it</font>

610
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,189
really is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i think we ran out of</font>

611
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,260
time but uh maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to</font>

612
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:51,720
the list they definitely creating a lot

613
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:56,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">of interest well at least questions so</font>

614
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,420
so okay the the first question is do we

615
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:03,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">have enough interest to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a call for</font>

616
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:05,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">adoption</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I guess you're asking</font>

617
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:09,840

620
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:18,170

621
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:24,419
we heard from<font color="#E5E5E5"> jen and from i lost you</font>

627
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:48,320
tunnels document there was some feedback

628
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:52,740
some sentiment towards moving forward

629
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,909
Joe and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have agreed to meet up after</font>

638
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:20,009
discussion on the list so so is there

639
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:22,380
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> other comment yes yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah Lucy I'm</font>

640
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:25,140
from a hallway actually I did to talk to

641
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:26,700
the Jew<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the history of I think the</font>

642
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:29,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">one sections have regarding the</font>

643
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:31,980
implementation summary or something this

644
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:33,659
quite empty I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you want</font>

645
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,909
to do about this the session

646
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:38,280
is so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know why it is saying that</font>

647
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:42,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">when we might wanna I think of many</font>

648
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:45,980
things still not a failing yet I'm

649
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:49,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to remember that section we it</font>

650
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:52,260
this is the implementations yeah yeah we

651
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:55,770
didn't maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll end up removing it i</font>

652
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:59,400
don't know i need to meet<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with with</font>

653
00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:00,630
joe on that if there if there are

654
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,740
outstanding issues let's get them

655
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:08,480
recorded now there is some on the list

656
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:11,220
that's another one the<font color="#E5E5E5"> implementation a</font>

657
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,720
summary and looks like Eric's got

658
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,598
another one<font color="#CCCCCC"> well no it's the same one</font>

659
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,549
should that section 5.5 right where is

660
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,980
it a bunch of headings there's no

661
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:23,400
material yeah baby yeah we'll probably

662
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:26,520
end up removing it okay none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment</font>

663
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:29,130
is even<font color="#E5E5E5"> fall for the major session the</font>

664
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:31,380
tunnel the public description at

665
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:34,109
mandalay i think there's a more complete

666
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:36,349
part is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mq</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the fragmentation</font>

667
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:39,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">out of party you mentioned like a</font>

668
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:41,520
congestion something that's still empty

669
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,170
section it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones that are</font>

670
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,910
empty will likely be removed at this

671
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,430
point is what my feeling but I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

672
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:48,990
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe about it so yeah for that</font>

673
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:51,450
reason I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is ready for</font>

674
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:54,149
class<font color="#CCCCCC"> cob well wait till we get to the</font>

675
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:55,710
next Rev right but if it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not ready</font>

676
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:57,869
then it won't be then it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

677
00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:01,349
like there was some sentiment expressed

678
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:03,930
of time to move this forward it's been a

679
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:06,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">long time so I think that it's probably</font>

680
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:08,399
good for us to collect the feedback that

681
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:10,140
we have eliminate the sections that

682
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:15,779
aren't finished and try to move it

683
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:18,029
forward but you know please give

684
00:36:15,779 --> 00:36:19,650
feedback to the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> because Joe is</font>

685
00:36:18,029 --> 00:36:21,299
holding most of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pen here yeah</font>

686
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:23,579
exactly i think that was his request so

687
00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:25,740
please if you don't mind sending those

688
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:29,010
comment to the list up that'll help in

689
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:31,020
and other people that didn't hear those

690
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:34,890
discussions behind the doors so Tom

691
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:36,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're back Thanks hi my name is from</font>

692
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:39,538
Herbert I'm gonna give an update on

693
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:42,559
generic UDP encapsulation and identify

694
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:42,559
our locator addressing

695
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:51,420
so generic<font color="#E5E5E5"> UDP encapsulation I presented</font>

696
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:53,578
this i believe last IETF in area and the

697
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:56,970
idea is a basic encapsulation format

698
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:58,980
that's extensible we<font color="#E5E5E5"> request it working</font>

699
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:02,069
group adoption apparently it has been so

700
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:03,930
we now<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a working group draft one of</font>

701
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:05,880
the different one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the happenings</font>

702
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:09,598
since last IETF we got an in-depth

703
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:13,739
review by Bob<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brisco so I didn't respond</font>

704
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:17,039
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> most of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comments the second</font>

705
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:18,599
draft thats related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> goo is goo</font>

706
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:21,359
extensions draft this is a set of

707
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:23,759
fundamental extensions for generic UDP

708
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:27,749
encapsulation the primary<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference</font>

709
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:30,180
from last IETF is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> added a bit to</font>

710
00:37:27,749 --> 00:37:33,149
security to create a larger number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

711
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:35,430
possible security fields and that

712
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:38,460
required<font color="#CCCCCC"> rearrange rearranging the</font>

713
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:40,680
header just a little bit and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

714
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,470
security fields is defined to be more

715
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,348
like an<font color="#E5E5E5"> H Mac field so we have a hundred</font>

716
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:47,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">and thirty two-bit field that can do</font>

717
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:52,410
authentication in a similar way to

718
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:55,230
segment routing security next slide so

719
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:58,230
the GU extensions currently we have six

720
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:59,819
defined the first five here the security

721

offload fragmentation payload transform

723
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:06,808
those are in the primary<font color="#CCCCCC"> GU extensions</font>

724
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:08,519
draft that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned a virtual</font>

00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:13,470
draft which we're looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> in indigo</font>

727
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:17,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">three and then there's some number of</font>

728
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:22,439
other possible extensions that we we may

729
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:24,650
look at in the future<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks like so one</font>

730
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:28,230
clarification<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to make primarily</font>

731
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:29,970
based on some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob's input was to</font>

00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,700
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GU the model of</font>

00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:36,058
extensibility is not TL VZ it is flag

734
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:40,470
fields much like jury and the rationale

735
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:41,700
that we have for that is tlv zat later

736
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:43,980
three protocols and below have

737
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:46,890
historically not had a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of success as</font>

we know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 options</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in ipv6</font>

extension headers and terms of

740
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:54,809
processing we know there have a lot of

741
00:38:52,589 --> 00:38:56,040
complexity associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them wire</font>

742
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:59,730
overhead

743
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:01,740
hardware processing one other aspect of

744
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:05,010
this that was kind of input was a number

745
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:06,930
of expected options that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

746
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:09,840
have and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of basing this</font>

number<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how TCP options and IP options</font>

748
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,400
unfold it since there's no concept here

749
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:16,560
really up connections most of the

750
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,080
options are related<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to the</font>

751
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,630
encapsulation so we don't anticipate

752
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:23,730
having a whole bunch of options<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

753
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:25,380
being said goo does allow for kind of

754
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:27,960
endor specific options<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is something</font>

755
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,340
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in NV 03 just now but in terms</font>

756
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,990
of the options that we would intend on

757
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:33,600
standardizing we don't expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:37,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">them so they should fit into the the</font>

00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:40,259
framework of the flag fields for the at

<font color="#E5E5E5">least</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Im into the foreseeable future</font>

761
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:49,140
looks like so next steps on<font color="#CCCCCC"> GU we're</font>

762
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:50,970
going to ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the GU extensions</font>

763
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:55,379
become a working group item in an area

764
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:59,060
and also more feedback from this working

765
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:05,270
group would be appreciated thanks like

766
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:09,900
so turning to ila we updated the draft

767
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:11,490
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iolite main IL a draft is really</font>

768
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,420
about the data plane the control plane

769
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:17,100
and mobility will be another drafts and

770
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:20,340
I'll a also i presented last time in an

771
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:22,759
area refresher this is identify our

772
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:27,060
locator address saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a way to</font>

773
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:29,420
within a ipv6 address<font color="#CCCCCC"> in code identifier</font>

774
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:32,340
locator kind of like an encapsulation

775
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:34,560
we're also in the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> process of</font>

776
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,810
deploying this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook as our data</font>

777
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:41,700
center no data center virtualization

778
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:43,770
solution next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> one I think I wanted</font>

779
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">to mention is the mapping function this</font>

780
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:48,060
we clarified a little bit in the latest

781
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:51,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">draft so we separate ila host from ila</font>

782
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:53,190
routers the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host perform kind of what we</font>

783
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:55,830
think more of host functionality so they

784
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:58,950
can maintain a mapping table the routers

785
00:40:55,830 --> 00:41:00,690
maintain more of the complete set this

786
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:03,180
will have impact on the control plane it

787
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:05,730
doesn't affect the data plane too much

788
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:07,680
although we did add checksum offload or

789
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,349
checksum adjust and things like that to

790
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,019
compensate for

791
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:17,960
or faster translations on the host next

792
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:20,930
slide so the control plane work is being

793
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:23,180
done in parallel it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really clear</font>

794
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:26,739
yet if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is routing area work or in</font>

795
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:28,910
area we're also looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some</font>

796
00:41:26,739 --> 00:41:33,289
alternative solutions they may provide

797
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:36,379
input the ideas Lisp may help<font color="#E5E5E5"> us with a</font>

798
00:41:33,289 --> 00:41:39,220
control plane so that's we expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

799
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:43,369
will be defining this as we move forward

800
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:46,308
next slide there are a few caveats to

801
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:49,670
ila that we did kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of elaborate on in</font>

802
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:52,339
latest draft ICMP can't have some some

803
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:53,900
difficulties so the problem is when we

804
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:55,430
send a packet if it's translating the

805
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:58,460
network that actually changes the

806
00:41:55,430 --> 00:42:00,379
destination address if an ICMP error is

807
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,619
subsequently generated for that packet

808
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:06,710
and it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the source without</font>

809
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:09,079
anyone looking within the ICMP air it's

810
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:10,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the source season ICMP air</font>

811
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:12,859
for a destination that it didn't

812
00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:15,229
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> send to so there are two</font>

813
00:42:12,859 --> 00:42:17,598
mitigations to this one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the host</font>

814
00:42:15,229 --> 00:42:19,968
itself supports ila it can potentially

815
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,099
do the reverse translation and recover

816
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:25,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">the original destination in the ILA or</font>

817
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:27,950
in the ICM here and the second one is

818
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:31,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">more to do what has done in nadan RC</font>

819
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:33,529
5508 which is to actually in the path

820
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,719
somewhere if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit an IL a router can</font>

821
00:42:33,529 --> 00:42:38,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">do the reverse translation and again</font>

822
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:42,109
deliver the original ICMP or packet with

823
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:45,078
the original destination to the sexy to

824
00:42:42,109 --> 00:42:48,049
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> source multicast is also another</font>

825
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:50,059
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of difficult one so in ila we're</font>

826
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:52,999
modifying the destination address with

827
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:54,109
the locator obviously in multicast we

828
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:55,968
really can't do that would have to be

829
00:42:54,109 --> 00:42:58,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the source</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address but this creates some</font>

830
00:42:55,969 --> 00:43:01,700
convolutions modifying the source

831
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,710
address affects non multicast receivers

832
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:06,979
now have bad source address to send

833
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:08,839
replies so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned this this morning</font>

834
00:43:06,979 --> 00:43:10,968
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lisp and some lifts guys think this</font>

835
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:13,038
might be solvable so we'll look at look

836
00:43:10,969 --> 00:43:15,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">at it a little more but a current</font>

837
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:20,799
conclusion is ila and multicast probably

838
00:43:15,789 --> 00:43:20,799
aren't compatible next like

839
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:27,700
so one question that does come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

840
00:43:24,549 --> 00:43:30,730
relationship between hi others a

841
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:34,569
question just real quick on the aisle

842
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:39,190
and multicast maybe the ipv6 beer stuff

843
00:43:34,569 --> 00:43:41,970
would work did you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because it's</font>

844
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:44,289
a unique address sex stuff for droidekas

845
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:45,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">replica our leaders does replication in</font>

846
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:47,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">a different way not using multicast</font>

847
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:50,500
address space right<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the traditional</font>

848
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:52,828
way so it's brand new right those are

849
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:56,230
still multicast addresses right nope

850
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:58,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be been that sounds</font>

851
00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:01,029
that sounds good<font color="#E5E5E5"> we if we modify the</font>

852
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:03,609
destination<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like you do but we well</font>

853
00:44:01,029 --> 00:44:09,400
beer with none with unicast address yes

854
00:44:03,609 --> 00:44:11,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that's fine so both I langu or</font>

855
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,690
means to do network virtualization

856
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:16,839
overlay networks in a sense locator

857
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:19,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">identifier separation so GU is an</font>

858
00:44:16,839 --> 00:44:22,210
encapsulation it allows extensibility in

859
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:25,569
particular security is probably one of

860
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:29,319
the the stronger points at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least within</font>

861
00:44:25,569 --> 00:44:31,630
a data center<font color="#E5E5E5"> aisle a no extensibility</font>

862
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:34,538
but the advantage there that means no on

863
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:37,809
the wire overhead and in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I la</font>

864
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:40,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">in ila a TCP IP packet looks like TCP em</font>

865
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:44,349
tcp/ip on the wire and so we have

866
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:49,539
complete on the wire k para conformity

867
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:51,700
next like so the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> steps on ila we're</font>

868
00:44:49,539 --> 00:44:55,180
also requesting that this be taken up as

869
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:57,460
a working group item and as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned</font>

870
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:59,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">in parallel we will be working on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

871
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:02,740
control plane for this hopefully

872
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:04,269
leveraging some of the existing work on

873
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:09,700
control planes and other protocols that

874
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:11,979
are similar mark every question

875
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:15,060
um you mentioned data center

876
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:17,860
virtualization do you see active

877
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:22,980
migration of containers as something

878
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:27,400
facebook wants to do yes cool and why

879
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:28,990
the one of the fundamental problems we

880
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,940
have in a data center is that we have a

881
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:33,669
job scheduler scheduling thousands of

882
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:36,010
tasks and in order to do that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to</font>

883
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:39,040
figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best optimal placement to</font>

884
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:41,140
do in<font color="#E5E5E5"> bed and packing if they're wrong</font>

885
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,420
right now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of kill task</font>

886
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:45,190
and lose progress if we could do live

887
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:48,400
migration or something even close to

888
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:51,130
that we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to retain a lot of</font>

889
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,830
that progress and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of seamlessly</font>

890
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:55,960
continue on so there are other reasons

891
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:58,240
why we want this in the data center even

892
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,280
earlier than that live migration and

893
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,770
implies a lot of other stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to</font>

894
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,780
happen most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sexually implemented</font>

895
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:07,690
it turns out<font color="#E5E5E5"> but gluing all that</font>

896
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:09,370
together into an actual full scale data

897
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:10,660
center solutions a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

898
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:12,509
challenge we've been looking at this

899
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:15,460
problem for for many years right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

900
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:16,780
these job schedulers there what they're

901
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,270
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty crazy they have to</font>

902
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:21,490
optimize all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these jobs and like I</font>

903
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:23,440
said if they're wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> and something</font>

904
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:25,330
higher priority comes along right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

905
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,160
do a lot of task killing and losing

906
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:30,009
progress so there is some value in that

907
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:33,879
but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other the earlier advantage of</font>

908
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:36,700
ila is that giving them an address /

909
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:38,770
cask actually simplifies a lot of the

910
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:40,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">management the service look up and</font>

911
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:42,400
things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why we're</font>

912
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:44,370
implementing it now really is to get

913
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,570
that first step which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dress / task</font>

914
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:47,980
does some interesting things every task

915
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:50,020
now has an<font color="#CCCCCC"> address which means it has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

916
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:51,670
full port space that it can use so we

917
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:53,590
never have to worry about pork conflicts

918
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:58,420
between two tasks anymore in the same

919
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:59,830
machine great stuff thanks thanks so we

920
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:01,750
have a non-tech road from entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

921
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:04,569
a non technical question so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> envio</font>

922
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:06,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">three they made a decision that the the</font>

923
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:10,900
alternative envio three things will be

924
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:13,780
halted until their new<font color="#CCCCCC"> a single solution</font>

925
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:16,240
will be just published does this apply

926
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:18,730
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tugu now that you move to inter real</font>

927
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,669
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> difference between go and the</font>

928
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:22,910
envy of three protocols is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> goo is</font>

929
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,339
really a generic product

930
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:27,890
which is the primary reason why we asked

931
00:47:25,339 --> 00:47:29,480
to put it into Ontario the network

932
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:32,359
virtualization component of goo is

933
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,740
really just a 32-bit identifier that

934
00:47:32,359 --> 00:47:37,160
makes it a network virtualization

935
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:38,779
protocol but for goo proper we're

936
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually finding a lot of use cases just</font>

937
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:44,119
as basically a extensible replacement

938
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:46,069
for GRE honestly is kind of what it's

939
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:48,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">like Jerry we hit the wall and in terms</font>

940
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:50,839
of beyond to add fields to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so goo</font>

941
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:52,848
kind of picks up<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that left me love</font>

942
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:55,069
Ralph<font color="#E5E5E5"> right the collation was more will</font>

943
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:56,569
the document be halted until the end go

944
00:47:55,069 --> 00:48:00,349
three workers finish em via<font color="#E5E5E5"> three is</font>

945
00:47:56,569 --> 00:48:03,380
proceeding to define a product call so

946
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:05,690
right now they're trying to take the

947
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,760
best of all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> envy of three protocols</font>

948
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:10,069
and create a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> one right so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

949
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">think they're pursuing any of the three</font>

950
00:48:10,069 --> 00:48:13,910
protocols that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're working group items</font>

951
00:48:11,539 --> 00:48:15,520
as the protocol of NB a--<font color="#E5E5E5"> three they're</font>

952
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:17,598
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with separate protocol</font>

953
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,420
just just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick description of the</font>

954
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,400
answer is no like do that right and but

955
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:25,640
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> do have a different question about ila</font>

956
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,559
right like so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I went through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the RAF and</font>

957
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,089
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really no scoping for the draft so</font>

958
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:31,760
where's the where is it applicable and

959
00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:33,770
stuff like that right so the way it's

960
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">written today it cannot work on the</font>

961
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:37,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right like it works very well</font>

962
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,510
in the data center but like it needs

963
00:48:37,069 --> 00:48:39,859
like more work to work on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

964
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:42,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the control plane part right like</font>

965
00:48:39,859 --> 00:48:43,970
that you allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write so there's</font>

966
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:46,609
like two ways either you scope it

967
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:48,319
tightly to a data center<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it goes</font>

968
00:48:46,609 --> 00:48:49,819
forward or like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to work on the</font>

969
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:51,349
control plane and but I think you need

970
00:48:49,819 --> 00:48:54,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a payment like which direction</font>

971
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:56,450
you want to go doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense um I'm</font>

972
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:58,009
not sure we'd agree that it can't work

973
00:48:56,450 --> 00:49:01,129
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet I think we would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

974
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:04,220
define what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means one of the use</font>

975
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:07,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases we're looking at is the 5g and the</font>

976
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:10,399
mobility as a solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I la as a</font>

977
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:12,950
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> for mobility the question is</font>

978
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,750
where do you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do translations so</font>

979
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,848
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> translation is basically you can</font>

980
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:18,980
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them as tunnels so if I need a</font>

981
00:49:16,849 --> 00:49:20,750
tunnel over part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet as long</font>

982
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:22,880
as I have an ingress point an egress

983
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:25,940
point under your control<font color="#CCCCCC"> I under my</font>

984
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,010
control and what we think will happen in

985
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:30,770
say a mobile carrier is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

986
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:32,869
packets enter into the network from the

987
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:34,339
internet we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do translation there and</font>

988
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:36,620
within the carrier's network actually

989
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:39,560
get it to the right base station

990
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:45,130
and where the the ue is located so

991
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:46,910
that's not a data center sort of

992
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:49,160
implementation that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

993
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:51,440
carriers then that will get us into the

994
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,970
possibility if two different carriers

995
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,920
are talking with each other can they

996
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:56,839
exchange enough information so that i

997
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,820
can do the translation in one carrier

998
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,500
that takes a packet all the way into

999
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:03,110
another because<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember once the pack</font>

1000
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:06,110
is translated<font color="#CCCCCC"> to any note on the path</font>

1001
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:08,720
it's just a packet they are just routing

1002
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:10,430
this based on the upper 64 bits so that

1003
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,549
they won't know so we don't need

1004
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:14,660
explicit ila support anywhere except the

1005
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:17,570
end points that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually dealing</font>

1006
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:18,470
with it right like so as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the</font>

1007
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:21,050
endpoints are under your control

1008
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:23,209
everything works right as long as the

1009
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:24,620
endpoints support the protocol surfers

1010
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:27,860
from that perspective it's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

1011

tunnel<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thanks ok just fine no</font>

1012
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:34,280
question wrapping up then sorry we've

1013
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,919
had that discussion and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to move</font>

1014
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,290
on quickly to the to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> topic you</font>

1015
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:41,630
say you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> request a working</font>

1016
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:43,730
group draft we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> gooey inherited from</font>

1017
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:45,050
mb l3 here and now we're having<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1018
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:47,150
discussion whether this is applicable to

1019
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:49,720
to internet or<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific so strange are</font>

1020
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:53,830
you are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> assuming that it'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

adopted here or in nov 03 the the ILA

1022
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:58,730
yes we're asking for working group

1023
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:00,140
adoption in there in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Terry for island in</font>

1024
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:02,810
time in Berlin we actually had a

1025
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:05,600
in-depth discussion with the ids and

1026
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:09,200
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the recommendation ok</font>

1027
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:11,779
so can we have 30 seconds before<font color="#E5E5E5"> miss my</font>

1028
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:15,319
grades just sure um<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did this review</font>

1029
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:17,480
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> tolman and there was like two month</font>

1030
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,920
one way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lay on the reply and i'll</font>

1031
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,920
give a two month one way delay on me

1032
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,360
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to be a symmetric path</font>

1033
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:26,120
it's just it takes that long to read all

1034
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:27,200
that stuff ok ok thank you will get a

1035
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,450
respond I was great that was great

1036
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,980
review by the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinks so too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> late for</font>

1037
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:32,480
one more comment on yeah sorry we're

1038
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:38,090
very leaked on there<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but just to</font>

1041
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:45,560
partially partition links so just to

1042
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:49,549
refresh our memory so these are links

1043
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:50,360
that looks like ipv4 ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> or looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1044
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:53,990
a layer

1045
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:56,480
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single link but it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uniformly</font>

1046
00:51:53,990 --> 00:52:00,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">forward packets between the different</font>

1047
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:02,690
ports attached to the link there are

1048
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,730
typically so that hose can talk the

1049
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:06,830
routers and routers can talk to host but

1050
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:09,080
host can talk to host to simplify and

1051
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:11,270
there's there's at least two examples of

1052
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:14,930
this one is split-horizon being used in

1053
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:17,120
dsl where the router thinks it's a

1054
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:19,460
single link sees it as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single IP</font>

1055
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:22,549
prefix assigned to that but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host can</font>

1056
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:24,170
actually talk to each other and the

1057
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:26,390
other one is private vlans which is a

1058
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:28,490
bit more complicated and as a result is

1059
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:31,339
a superset so the document talks about

1060
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:33,259
that as the sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> model for this where</font>

1061
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:36,010
you have three different classes of

1062
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:40,100
ports promiscuous community and isolated

1063
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:42,200
and in particular this allows for having

1064
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:44,180
multiple promiscuous port so these are

1065
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,830
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ports</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that can talk to everybody and</font>

1066
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:53,000
that's where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would connect your</font>

1067
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:54,590
routers so next slide so this we've

1068
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,200
talked about this document a couple of

1069
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:59,390
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in the interior so there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1070
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,939
valid a few things based on common from

00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:04,250
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Working Group</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one is about the GP</font>

1072
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:05,870
implications it turned out that there

1073
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:09,260
weren't any but it was like useful to

1074
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:10,880
look out at each<font color="#CCCCCC"> PD hd2</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PD for and</font>

1077
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:19,250
redirects where the observation is that

1078
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:21,440
yeah you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off redirects for</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's not clear that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1080
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,790
reach the target that you were

1081
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:31,490
redirected to in particular with ipv6

1082
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:33,380
redirect and added in appendix about

1083
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:36,049
some layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 implications that have</font>

1084
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:37,790
observed which is a bit more sort of not

1085
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:39,560
part of the core of the document because

1086
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:42,350
it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an operational observation</font>

1087
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:46,759
that you can get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning issues</font>

1088
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:48,830
when you are using basically two

1089
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,050
different VLAN tags in the two

1090
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:52,250
directions for the packets flows you

1091
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:55,250
might not actually learn the way you

1092
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:58,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">expect them and in some earlier revision</font>

1096
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,340
at the document the last slide has some

1097
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,650
about that or you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go read the</font>

1098
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:12,740
document it's not very long but it seems

1099
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:14,360
like I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten any negative</font>

1100
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:16,339
feedback of their stuff there hasn't

1101
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">been that many comment other than the</font>

1102
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:21,770
ones have responded here but it seems

1103
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:23,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">like this is operating a bit like a</font>

1104
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:25,670
working of document<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of getting</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going through the revision cycle and</font>

1106
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:30,740
whatever but my biggest question is is

1107
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:32,840
this something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's useful and if so</font>

1108
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:34,609
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go through the the process</font>

1109
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:38,330
motions making it<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in your blast</font>

1110
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:40,100
call as to<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that sorry make it</font>

1111
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:42,950
a working of document and then is there

1112
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:44,839
something that people can read and see

1113
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:47,859
is it ready for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a working a blast call</font>

1114
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:51,230
it the document is not very long so

1115
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:53,180
thanks so much questions well we don't

1116
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:54,680
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> much dental so let's take it to the</font>

1117
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:57,049
list but definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys I think that</font>

1118
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:58,879
makes sense to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to make a call for</font>

1119
00:54:57,050 --> 00:55:00,320
adoption and then make right there the

1120
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,810
announcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is something we</font>

1121
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:17,150
want to advance<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks so run or you</font>

1122
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:21,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">still run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks ok special registries</font>

1123
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:25,460
um a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years back well every once in a</font>

1124
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:27,890
while the ITF allocates a block of

1125
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:32,030
addresses for a special use things like

1126
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:34,520
10 / 8 or 192 168 / 16 you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1127
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:36,350
familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> with those addresses well once</font>

1128
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:39,020
upon a time every few years we used to

1129
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:42,890
write a document that talked about all

1130
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:46,009
of the special addresses and superseded

1131
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:48,140
the last one<font color="#E5E5E5"> about five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago Brian</font>

1133
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:51,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">Vigoda and I wrote a document that</font>

1134
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:59,180
catalog them all said this was going to

1135
00:55:51,920 --> 00:56:01,340
be the last document and from now<font color="#CCCCCC"> on we</font>

1136
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:03,520
would just update iono registries when

1137
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:07,550
you allocate a new special<font color="#E5E5E5"> address and</font>

1138
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:09,590
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole document 6890 said when</font>

1139
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:11,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do this these are the pieces of</font>

1140
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:13,100
information that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> must put in the</font>

1141
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:15,050
registry so people will know what the

1142
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:16,759
address is that way we don't need to

1143
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:18,230
write the document to get you know we

1144

<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need to update this document</font>

1145
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:24,290
every few years well anyway um we wrote

1146
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:28,310
this RFC 6890 it was a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> boring</font>

1147
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:30,560
document and nobody read it and it had a

1148
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:34,910
bug in it and nobody noticed it for five

1149
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:37,400
years basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is the bug um one</font>

1150
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:41,180
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attributes that I said you needed</font>

1151
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:44,150
to describe when you posted a new

1152
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:47,779
registry is an attribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> called global</font>

1153
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:49,850
and in my mind what that meant is this

1154
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:53,720
prefix is likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be found in the</font>

1155
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:56,180
global routing tables anyway years<font color="#E5E5E5"> later</font>

1156
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:58,939
people will use the document they looked

1157
00:56:56,180 --> 00:57:01,490
at this global field and said hey wait a

1158
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:03,920
minute this<font color="#E5E5E5"> special address you say its</font>

1159
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:05,509
global and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not and we all</font>

1160
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,100
scratched our head a little while and

1161
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:09,440
thought about well why are we having

1162
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:11,660
this argument well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because our</font>

1163
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:14,810
definitions of the word global<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

1164
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:16,879
different when I use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the word global</font>

1165
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:20,150
writing the document the very first time

1166
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:23,119
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it meant you're likely to find</font>

1167
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:26,600
this and the global<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing tables what</font>

1168
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:29,690
other people thought is global in the

1169
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:32,868
sense of the IP addressing architectures

1170
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:36,140
global meaning it has significance

1171
00:57:32,869 --> 00:57:40,340
beyond the administrative domain global

1172
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:43,339
scope exactly anyway we updated the

1173
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:45,980
document to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific about what we</font>

1174
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:48,350
meant by global and the meaning is

1175
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:51,530
global scope because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> change the</font>

1176
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:54,290
definition of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that word global scope for</font>

1177
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:56,140
a couple of the addresses we changed

1178
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:59,180
their global setting from true to false

1179
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:01,359
you know we were false to true we you

1180
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:03,319
know we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was false because it</font>

1181
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:04,609
doesn't show up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the global routing</font>

1182
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:07,910

1183
00:58:04,609 --> 00:58:10,279

1184
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:13,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">um we can skip all the way through the</font>

1185
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:17,450
slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this document reiterates</font>

1186
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:19,580
what the rules are well first it talks

1187
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:21,799
about all the special addresses it

1188
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:24,230
reiterates the rules what is it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:26,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">to say about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an address when you're</font>

back up back

1193
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:35,560
you have one minute there see<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i'll</font>

1194
00:58:34,089 --> 00:58:37,000
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> through this finished these are the</font>

1200
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:54,750
use of this word global it's still very

1201
00:58:52,599 --> 00:59:00,010
boring so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I assume no one will read it</font>

1202
00:58:54,750 --> 00:59:01,690
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> progress it just tensing this club</font>

1203
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:03,550
and its really hard to read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

1204
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:06,490
couldn't find it anywhere and these

1205
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:09,220
errands meeting materials in the

1206
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:11,259
document take care<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have problem</font>

1207
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:13,750
finding good I know if I think it's

1208
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:16,180
badly named so it'll be referred to send

1209
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:18,010
it to the list it's not an interior

1210
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:19,990
actually I have a quick question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1211
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:21,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">still ad sponsored or is it I have a</font>

1212
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:23,020
figure but i just want answer gender

1213
00:59:21,609 --> 00:59:25,810
suresh krisshnan so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think there's a</font>

1214
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:29,109
typo in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides so it's 6890 bills</font>

1215
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:30,849
not 4890 base so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 6890</font>

1216
00:59:29,109 --> 00:59:34,990
play so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta find the document so</font>

1217
00:59:30,849 --> 00:59:36,580
it's a it's a sit anyway so um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1218
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:38,950
mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing either one the last one was</font>

1219
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:41,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">like 80 sponsored by ralphs so like I</font>

1220
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:43,089
can pick it up like it's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the group</font>

1221
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:44,470
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> side so if like you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring</font>

1222
00:59:43,089 --> 00:59:45,640
it to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just bring it I'm happy either</font>

1223
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:49,660
one just gonna run it through group

1224
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:51,220
anyway so okay okay so quick just a pop

1225
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:53,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hindi just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to confirm this is same</font>

1226
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:56,410
document that was talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> at six</font>

1227
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,270
man in Berlin right I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure I</font>

1228
00:59:56,410 --> 01:00:01,180
wasn't in brielle Berlin leaders I

1229
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:03,430
that's what I'm not I think it in that

1230
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:05,919
case it was definitely discussed well

1231
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:07,720
but it was this issue came up on the v6

1232
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,040
yes that's right the issue person so I

1233
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:14,709
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was talking about in berlin in</font>

1234
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:19,109
six min<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so we're off time if we can</font>

1235
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:24,369
just give a quick one over this people

1236
01:00:19,109 --> 01:00:28,480
yes please hey hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> humph link i'm</font>

1237
01:00:24,369 --> 01:00:30,730
presenting here draft to stay on the

1241
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:44,150
from other companies next the motivation

1242
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:47,210
of this sep draft this is for

1243
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:49,210
currently the device is their multi

1244
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:51,410
connectivity capable<font color="#CCCCCC"> similarly tab</font>

1245
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:53,690
applications than her and the multi

1246
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:59,828
connectivity can use be closer to my

1247
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:59,829
crease yes but on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand it was</font>

1248
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:06,410
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the on the other hand the quality</font>

1249
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:08,480
of experience depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on which access</font>

1250
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:10,190
you are selecting and what is the core

1251
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:13,069
network and what is the part in the

1252
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:16,400
network so Phi Phi has totally different

1253
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:19,369
of different characteristics than LT in

1254
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:23,059
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of scalability and coverings</font>

1255
01:01:19,369 --> 01:01:25,670
and I'm similarly the core networks did

1256
01:01:23,059 --> 01:01:28,819
they differ what kind of services they

1257
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:32,210
offer so in order to guarantee the best

1258
01:01:28,819 --> 01:01:34,460
combination for quality<font color="#CCCCCC"> of service</font>

1259
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:37,160
consistent quality service we need some

1260
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:40,760
sort of mechanics to combine these

1261
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:43,940
different pieces of the connectivity

1262
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:46,930

1264
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:52,419
what it proposes is the ability to

1265
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:55,130
select access and core network parts

1266
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:57,470
independently so that that we can

1267
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:59,750
dynamically adapt this election based on

1268
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:03,500
network conditions so we have visibility

1269
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:05,359
in the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> paths it is a negotiation</font>

on the analytics of the network and

1284

01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:16,430
network internals<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a visibility across</font>

1292
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:20,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">these access networks which are depicted</font>

1293
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:25,190
here dsl LTE and Wi-Fi for instance and

1294
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:26,840
it has a controlled bath negotiation

1295
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:29,210
path with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the corresponding entity at</font>

1297
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:35,510
client connection manager as it is

1298
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:38,779
called and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we have two proxies</font>

1299
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:42,110
data data would use a plane proxies that

1300
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:45,740
the deal with a multiple user claim

1301
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:47,960
protocol so the solution is not coupled

1302
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:50,089
with any of the transport protocols but

1303
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:53,050
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> providing this capability of</font>

01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:55,100
nicosia switch IP address and which

1305
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:58,930
encapsulation and which transport

1306
01:03:55,100 --> 01:04:02,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">protocol is to be used next slide please</font>

1307
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:05,319
so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of that other IETF work</font>

1308
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:09,700
on on this area is the control

1309
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:12,050
mechanisms for negotiating between the

1310
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:14,359
client and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network the proper</font>

1311
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:19,040
configuration to pick up the correct

1312
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:26,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">path in a dynamic way it is agnostic to</font>

1313
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:27,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">the transport protocols I me well I</font>

1314
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:32,990
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's that's pretty much the</font>

1315
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:35,720
key points of there and then there are a

1316
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:39,680
couple of publications highlighting the

1317
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:45,049
benefits of doing this kind of path

1318
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:46,790
selection yep so give it like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font>

1319
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:49,940
this relate to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lulu to the work being</font>

1320
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:52,850
discussed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a banana boss it really</font>

1321
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:55,550
relates pretty much so so I think that

1322
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:58,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">if bun and above leads to a working</font>

1323
01:04:55,550 --> 01:05:00,620
group that's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> the place</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where to</font>

1324
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:03,290
decide so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would suggest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1325
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:04,490
where this that's where this draft and

1326
01:05:03,290 --> 01:05:07,670
have it belong then

1327
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:09,919
afraid your success that that we we are

1328
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:14,750
presenting is tomorrow in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the banana</font>
