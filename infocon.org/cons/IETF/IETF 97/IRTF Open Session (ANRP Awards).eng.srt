1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:07,529
so I thought we'll take pictures in the

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,020
open meeting in Seoul can I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you guys</font>

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:22,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you keep the doors closed because</font>

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,279
the noise is really distracting Matt

7
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:39,270
yeah bar<font color="#CCCCCC"> the doors all right um this is</font>

8
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:42,449
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IIT</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fip our policy it's basically</font>

9
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,719
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same one as the IETF IPR policy</font>

10
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:49,079
meaning with you make a contribution you

11
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:52,050
are required to disclose any IPR that

12
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,610
you hold or that a organization that you

13
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,038
work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> holds that you know have</font>

14
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,109
personal knowledge of and we request

15
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you file other IPR and</font>

16
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,699
contributions that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about so you</font>

17
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,179
should know all this if you don't you

18
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:08,729
should really<font color="#E5E5E5"> read it the slides are</font>

19
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,460
uploaded my slides were very late so

20
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,929
apologize<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that but they're up now</font>

21
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,610
you can dial in remotely you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

22
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,140
figured this out already we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

23
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,759
mailing lists one is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> announced list</font>

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,680
um that sees very little traffic

25
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,259
basically when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC's get published</font>

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,750
and new group start and stop there's a

27
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,000
discussion list that sees also very few

28
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,119
traffic because nothing much gets

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,310
discussed that is I ITF wide um most of

30
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,270
it is on the individual research group

31
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,250
lists today<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have the usual like five</font>

32
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,229
to ten minutes of me telling you what

33
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,720
has happened in the last couple months

34
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,159
followed by the two main events which

35
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,520
are the applied networking research

36
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,579
prices these are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last two prizes for</font>

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,140
2016 we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> six in total because we had</font>

38
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:56,429
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty large number of submissions arm</font>

39
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:59,219
and the 2017<font color="#E5E5E5"> selection is actually going</font>

40
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,310
on at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment um maybe a little bit</font>

41
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">more about this later um so where are we</font>

42
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,799
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten research groups meeting</font>

43
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,539
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot we have 11 charted right</font>

44
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,569
now so almost all of them are media

45
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting except for Gaia including a new</font>

46
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,700
one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

47
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,950
RG measurement analysis for protocols

48
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:21,429
and we have a proposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> network machine</font>

49
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,440
learning working group meeting that'll

50
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,320
be their last meeting as a proposed

51
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,390
group and after this me and Ellison who

52
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,890
is going to succeed me<font color="#E5E5E5"> will sit down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

53
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">decide whether we want to charter them</font>

54
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:37,179
formally or whether they have run out of

55
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:40,360
runway you are in the RTF open meeting

56
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,820
on Thursday morning the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IAB reviews one</font>

57
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,130
of the research groups traditionally

58
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,230
during each meeting this time it's the

59
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:49,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">human rights protocol considerations</font>

60
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,649
group which had a meeting earlier today

61
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:55,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">which was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting out here I</font>

62
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:57,460
wasn't there bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> nap RG since it's</font>

63
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,380
a new group right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is you can</font>

64
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this if you're been around long</font>

65
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,220
enough this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second iteration of</font>

66
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,420
the imrg the internet measurement

67
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,410
research group so the idea is that

68
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,970
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of measurement efforts</font>

69
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,730
going on in academia but also outside

70
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:16,930
but but the results are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

71
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:21,010
widely used to you know dr engineering

72
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:22,300
and and the ideas to bridge that gap so

73
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,730
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things that are in</font>

74
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,640
scope here that are listed in these

75
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,980
bullets they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a meeting</font>

76
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">later on the last few meetings that they</font>

77
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,410
had as a proposed group of very

78
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,080
interesting so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have sort of high hopes</font>

79
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they keep up the history of</font>

80
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:41,050
interesting presentations that I've

81
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:42,550
managed to invite we have a new addition

82
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to these slides that i'm going to do</font>

83
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:47,440
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one until I stepped on march</font>

84
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,180
which is called research group news so

85
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,090
far we have one news item unless there's

86
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,980
something in my inbox that i missed the

87
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">HRP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just mentioned human rights</font>

88
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,910
protocol considerations they have their

89
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:00,700
first draft going into<font color="#E5E5E5"> last call next</font>

90
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">week it'll be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a long last call and they</font>

91
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked for wide reviews and it's an</font>

92
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:08,250
interesting document because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no not</font>

93
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:11,170
very technical but it is you know

94
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,510
interesting in that it makes

95
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:17,529
observations about how protocol design

96
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:20,230
can impact fundamental human rights so

97
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:21,820
in it it is broadly applicable to

98
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,640
basically everything we do in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IR ITF</font>

99
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,240
an idea so if you have nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> better to</font>

100
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,340
do on the flight home it's

101
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,610
so good it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good read and send</font>

102
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:36,198
<font color="#CCCCCC">needles on the guys feedback we have an</font>

103
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:38,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">IR TF RFC stream it is not quite as busy</font>

104
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:41,440
as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF stream but we did manage to</font>

105
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,759
publish for rfcs since the last meeting

106
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,199
three of which came from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

107
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,840
information-centric networking research

108
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,139
group and one came from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gaia their first</font>

109
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,159
document and a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> more in the queue</font>

110
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:56,979
from various other research groups so

111
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,680
probably going to see a few more by

112
00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:03,110
Chicago these are the four that were

113
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,870
published um you know research

118
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,280
actually an interesting read last time I

119
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,520
said that the IB wanted feedback on the

120

candidates for<font color="#CCCCCC"> I RTF chair studying</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">March 2017 you've sent feedback that was</font>

122
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,270
very helpful<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the IAB in making a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Mencken who is not really a newbie um</font>

125
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,810
but will take up this role there's a

126
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,198
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bio there that those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you in</font>

127
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:44,060
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> row can probably even read</font>

128
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,030
very happy with the selection thank you

129
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:50,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">for volunteering and I hope you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

130
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,619
good time I had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good time she's</font>

131
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:58,550
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up there if you wanna meet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> her</font>

132
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:59,840
later on all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> um we have two things</font>

133
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,159
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with a polite networking</font>

134
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,039
research one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the workshop and one is</font>

135
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:06,050
the prize this is about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> workshop um</font>

136
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,659
so the URL is wrong because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I copied us</font>

137
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,800
from Berlin so it should be 2017 there

138
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:12,199
so we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this again we did the</font>

139
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,259
first one in Prague we're doing one in

140
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,750
2017 so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a academic peer-reviewed</font>

141
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:21,139
workshop it's it's technically

142
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:23,120
co-sponsored by ACM sigcomm we have to

143
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:25,729
tpc chairs for next year which are

144
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">Renata Teixeira and your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cod um they're</font>

145
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:30,318
both on the sitcom<font color="#CCCCCC"> Executive Committee</font>

146
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:33,820
which tells you a little bit that sikkim

147
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:37,610
actually takes this as important

148
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:40,190
proceedings are open access<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plan</font>

149
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">is or the we will co-locate us with</font>

150

TF in Prague it will be on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Saturday</font>

151
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,969
before the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ittf meeting in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Prague it's a</font>

152
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:51,200
full day event the call for papers

153
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:52,970
should be out<font color="#CCCCCC"> soon probably still this</font>

154
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">year i'm guessing the submission</font>

155
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:58,070
deadline will be somewhere in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

156
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:00,230
februari time frame maybe march on peer

157
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:06,260
review takes a month so notifications

158
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:08,300
probably April May it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

159
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:11,000
interesting event so if you even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

160
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,130
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> send anything in you should maybe</font>

161
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,040
think about attending<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you can look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

162
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,420
the web page for the 2016 meeting to see

163
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,870
what the papers and presentations were

164
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:23,390
armed it was a pretty successful event

165
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:26,090
so if you are in Prague on Saturday

166
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,260
because you wanna arrive early to get

167
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:31,520
rid of the jet lag before the craziness

168
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,659
starts come to this the second thing

169
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,479
that starts the plight networking

170
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,860
research is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the prize we've been doing</font>

171
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">this for five years now so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

172
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:42,470
not be new anymore it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> together with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

173
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:46,310
sock we had 53 nominations for 2016

174
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:48,650
which is the largest<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever for 2017 the</font>

175
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,919
nomination period just ended and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

176
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:54,859
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4d but one was a double</font>

177
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,979
nomination so we have 39 that entered

178
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">this election um the lumber is slightly</font>

179
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,460
lower but I think the quality based on

180
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,410
what I've seen glancing through

181
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,870
submissions is is easily as high as it

182
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,130
was this<font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm expecting we're</font>

183
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,840
going to have again a very tough

184
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:12,409
decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pick a few of these for the</font>

185
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,929
prize selection committee is some mighty

186
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:18,919
effort some irt efforts and by now we've

187
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:21,590
also added a few of the usually senior

188
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:22,729
professors from the awarded papers over

189
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,429
the last few years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're</font>

190
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:28,400
going to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that arm so that we</font>

191
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:31,100
actually have academic representation on

192
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,419
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> committee specifically from those</font>

193
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,770
sort of people that seem to have

194
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:36,140
successfully done interesting research

195
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:39,530
in the past also they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us pick</font>

196
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,468
<font color="#CCCCCC">the next crop and part of the award is</font>

197
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:44,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">the talks that are going to follow this</font>

198
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:48,440
and i<font color="#CCCCCC"> should say comcast is again</font>

199
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,880
extended to sponsor this for I don't

200
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,070
know how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> years were committed but</font>

201
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,689
at least at least one year so thank you

202
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">very much if other</font>

203
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,560
organizations would like to support<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

204
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,020
ni p met<font color="#CCCCCC"> fort from i sock will be super</font>

206
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,189
buy you a beer or something but<font color="#E5E5E5"> but all</font>

207
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,260
kidding aside right so this helps us

208
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,060
because there is a cost associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

209
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:11,689
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's a travel grant to come</font>

210
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:13,520
here it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially a second repeat</font>

211
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:16,130
invitation right so a lot of the

212
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,079
prizewinners actually go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and</font>

213
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:20,720
participate regularly and and part of

214
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,520
the prizes that if you start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

215
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">engaged we bring you back a second time</font>

216
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,240
even without a talk and without an award

217
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:30,830
and that has happened actually i think

218
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:35,090
we had 26 um winners up until today<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

219
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:37,280
no what<font color="#E5E5E5"> 28 now but 26 of them 11 came</font>

220
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:39,530
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Isaac money and 13 came back on</font>

221
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,839
their own dime so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a sort</font>

222
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:44,089
of good history of pulling people in

223
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,700
through the price and and the

224
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:51,740
sponsorship helps us bring the people

225
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:54,470
back right so with two talks um both of

226
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,840
them are or used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be student from</font>

routing so that is also very interesting

235
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,760
so one is for flipping I think that's

236
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:22,220

262
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,450
review and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is joint work with</font>

263
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,410
Stephanie<font color="#CCCCCC"> avicii Shore van bebber and</font>

264
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:25,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jenny 4x4 whoo well I've worked as at</font>

265
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:27,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">least I serves me you can see so we'll</font>

266
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:29,750
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about fibbing so some people</font>

267
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,850
yesterday told me is disciplined yes it

268
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:35,060
is you can switch<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next one and so</font>

269
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:37,370
we call this fitting because we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

270
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:40,160
lie to the rotors to control their fib

271
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:42,499
literally so that's as simple as this

272
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,769
and so you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to skip a lot nope</font>

273
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:47,809
so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start off to understand what we</font>

274
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:50,479
mean by this out right before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font>

275
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:52,759
started if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have questions be sure to</font>

276
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:55,269
just ask them right away that's going to

277
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:59,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">be easier to follow the rest basically</font>

278
00:12:55,269 --> 00:13:00,979
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we start with this simple this</font>

279
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:03,859
simple network so we have while the

280
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:07,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">usual results icons that are from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco</font>

281
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:09,469
and a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> heavy if we switch your next</font>

282
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:11,899
one it's easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us as we search or</font>

283
00:13:09,469 --> 00:13:13,929
to just use graphs so note for the

284
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:17,449
routers with a particular name and edges

285
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:19,779
yes again switcheroo next one and so in

286
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:22,399
for routing when you we speak about

287
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:25,399
interior traffic in introd them in

288
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:28,249
traffic we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> link set a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gps typically</font>

289
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:32,059
such<font color="#E5E5E5"> as first pay for sis and these</font>

290
00:13:28,249 --> 00:13:34,969
protocols basically compute and try to

291
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:37,699
share<font color="#E5E5E5"> a the network topology in order to</font>

292
00:13:34,969 --> 00:13:39,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">can switch in order to compute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

shortest path on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the graph to for a</font>

294
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:43,969
traffic in the network so for example

295
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:45,738
<font color="#CCCCCC">here I had a prefix so some reachability</font>

296
00:13:43,969 --> 00:13:48,439
information advertise on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

297
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:50,409
panel on the left and the protocol

298
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:53,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">managed to compute their shoulders path</font>

299
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:56,769
32 for the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving the pattern</font>

300
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:59,449
shown of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right you can switch so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

301
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:01,729
traditionally<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this set</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of protocols</font>

302
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:04,189
we have what we call<font color="#E5E5E5"> a descriptive</font>

303
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:06,529
minute descriptive<font color="#E5E5E5"> management process so</font>

304
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:09,169
that is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the operator</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe you</font>

305
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:11,959
that has to figure out what he wants to

306
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:14,989
do you can switch and then that that's

307
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:16,399
to figure out how to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

308
00:14:14,989 --> 00:14:19,069
have this particular policy in my

309
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,689
network I want this set of pass and now

310
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:22,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have a bunch of routers that I need to</font>

311
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:24,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">configure so I'll provision the</font>

312
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,319
configuration for each of them you can

313
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:29,509
switch and from there this is a disputed

314
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:31,878
protocol so we have every router that's

315
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:33,109
able to independently compute the

316
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:35,569
shortest path in order to further

317
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:37,970
traffic as we've done before so they

318
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:40,519
take some input drive fib and twist and

319
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:43,579
push them in the line card you can

320
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:45,769
switch so in the research role there's

321
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:48,529
been actually quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interest</font>

322
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:50,269
over the past few years towards Sen su

323
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:52,669
software-defined networking so we had

324
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:54,829
people open flow eight years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I know</font>

325
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:55,829
the the new trend the new hot topic is

326
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:59,189
before

327
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:01,500
so the wageworks there is that instead

328
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,930
of having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a distributed control plane we</font>

329
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,970
have a centralized one so some software

330
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,040
running some when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> networks and then</font>

331
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:11,430
super simple devices like switches for

332
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,860
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can switch and so in this</font>

333
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:15,540
management<font color="#E5E5E5"> model we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have what we call a</font>

334
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,210
declarative management model for the

335
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,860
operators because the operators<font color="#E5E5E5"> just has</font>

336
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,600
to think about what he wants the

337
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:24,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">networks to do and so express</font>

338
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,780
requirements you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font>

339
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:30,180
centralized control plane so let's say

340
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:32,880
one or two servers that need some

341
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,560
configuration input and this centralized

342
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,450
controller will then to hold the heavy

343
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,739
lifting on its behalf so in this case

344
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,990
compute the<font color="#E5E5E5"> part that match the</font>

345
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,240
requirements the five entries that need

346
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,640
to be set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on every single switches</font>

347
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,550
and purge these fit and twist towards

348
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,800
the switches so that's on do it but

349
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:52,079
there's like a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> errors well that's</font>

350
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,550
there's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> errors that goes to this to</font>

351
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">the controller and a lot of errors that</font>

352
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,760
goes out to basically we have a

353
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,709
bottleneck in the network so we have

354
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,870
this huge program that's a single part

355
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:03,570
of failure and while<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are quite a</font>

356
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:07,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of other challenges it was yet</font>

357
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:09,600
to be solved you can switch so basically

358
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,829
we have this state-of-the-art in the

359
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,320
sense that we have on the left what's

360
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:16,050
been major mainly used up to today so

361
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,880
distributed protocols so do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our super</font>

362
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,920
scalable<font color="#E5E5E5"> while the internet works today</font>

363
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,170
and we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP routing table that has</font>

364
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,750
over 600,000 prefixes I think these

365
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:27,630
numbers speak for themselves these are

366
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,220
fairly robust I mean usually you have

367
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:31,890
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the internet and it works and</font>

368
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the other hat on the other side we</font>

369
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:36,630
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a lot of all the</font>

370
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,580
promises like it's easier to manage

371
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:41,220
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want centralized</font>

372
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,230
controller it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more flexible because</font>

373
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,000
we've we've opened flowable for example

374
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,160
to do more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just destination base</font>

375
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,410
forwarding you are not restricted

376
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,870
anymore to plain shoulders by floating

377
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:54,600
because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the device supports</font>

378
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:57,840
you you do have some gains there but you

379
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,450
can switch but yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> this can we have a</font>

380
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,090
price and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the focus of this work is</font>

381
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:05,430
well we are looking what's in between

382
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,930
these two so we are trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit</font>

383
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:09,299
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a middle ground approach you can</font>

384
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:12,480
switch which<font color="#CCCCCC"> we call fibbing a</font>

385
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:15,209
and where we aim to be as manageable and

386
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,429
close to<font color="#CCCCCC"> as flexible as pure as the in</font>

387
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:19,470
solutions but we still<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be able</font>

388
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:21,509
to scale properly and to be robust to

389
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:24,269
failures so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you take the</font>

390
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:26,099
SD in wonder easier the easiest failure

391
00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:28,109
to understand is you lose the controller

392
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,998
where nothing happens anymore the switch

393
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:33,539
is under table to recover some themself

394
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:37,169
you use on a GP you break a router<font color="#CCCCCC"> while</font>

395
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:39,539
all the others are able to take over you

396
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:41,129
can switch and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we that's</font>

397
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:44,119
what we are going to cover today which

398
00:17:41,129 --> 00:17:46,619
is well how do we get to make this

399
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:48,689
fitting this architecture that's a bit

400
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:52,980
in media in between these two paradigm

401
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:55,200
in the network go ahead so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we start from</font>

402
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,570
the same basic idea in a sense that we

403
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,519
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be as manageable as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sdn so we</font>

404
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:01,859
have a centralized control plane a

405
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,840
control program a single interface for

406
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:05,489
the operators but we still want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep</font>

407
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,678
the distributed aspect of the control

408
00:18:05,489 --> 00:18:10,109
plane for scalability and with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

409
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">business concerns you can switch so in</font>

410
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:14,820
this particular model we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

411
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,559
operator that same as far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> en just</font>

412
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">expressed some requirements to the</font>

413
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,940
controller so it's easy for him it just

414
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:23,700
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to state what he wants and doesn't</font>

415
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,470
need to care how its implemented so the

416
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,570
controller itself will figure out how it

417
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,369
what are the paths<font color="#E5E5E5"> that need to be set</font>

418
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:32,908
in the network in order to implement

419
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:34,529
these requirements you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can skip and then</font>

420
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:36,720
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play with this part this</font>

421
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:39,320
distributed control planes which has

422
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">still which for which we still want to</font>

423
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,059
be in charge<font color="#CCCCCC"> of programming the flips</font>

424
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:47,070
basically so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have or</font>

425
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:49,759
controller touching each in the

426
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:53,700
individual hardware so how do we do this

427
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:57,029
while we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a well-defined</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Appy API</font>

428
00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:00,480
which is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP message themselves so</font>

429
00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:02,429
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we if you think of of SPF these are</font>

430
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,879
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ellises that you have so these are</font>

431
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:09,330
in a way some form of<font color="#CCCCCC"> API because when</font>

432
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:12,149
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> our I GPS in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network well</font>

433
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,769
you know that each of them will only be

434
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:17,008
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run shortest path computation</font>

435
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:19,649
but they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so on a particular</font>

436
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:22,019
graph that when for this graph is built

437
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:23,149
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the AGP message that they exchanged</font>

438
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:26,570
between each other

439
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:28,879
so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we manage to send submit stage</font>

440
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:31,070
that we control the intuition here that

441
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:33,678
we can basically modify the input of the

442
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:35,689
computation in order to control the

443
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,759
output which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well the set of paths</font>

444
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:41,779
that are found in a network we can

445
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:44,330
switch so how does does it work well if

446
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:46,369
you go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sample</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network we had</font>

447
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">before so in this network we would like</font>

448
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:53,839
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> blue the path towards the blue /</font>

449
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:56,539
ethics to take a different focus to move

450
00:19:53,839 --> 00:20:00,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">around so early on in the network you</font>

451
00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:02,960
add every single path from a be going to

452
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:04,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">router to towards see and in this case</font>

453
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,950
would like just the blue prefix to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

454
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:09,769
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way around so a bit more on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

455
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:11,899
left in order to select another path for

456
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:14,029
a single perfect so that's something

457
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:16,099
you're not you're normally not able to

458
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:17,659
do with normal a<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS because both</font>

459
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:20,418
prefixes are reachable through the same

460
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:22,070
routers and well one of the condition

461
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:27,320
for GPS to work is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't want</font>

462
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:29,059
loops so we cannot distance run path for

463
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,619
these prefixes but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we want</font>

464
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:33,200
to do in this case let's assume for

465
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:34,428
example that the brute prefix requires

466
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">the traffic to go through a firewall</font>

467
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:39,169
that's only located on the link<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

468
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,928
our running out and r2 so we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

469
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:45,589
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this sort of distinction you</font>

470
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:47,210

471
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:49,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">information that's been fed to the</font>

472
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:53,330

473
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:55,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">figure out what are the modification</font>

474
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:57,439
that I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do to the 2d a GP</font>

475
00:20:55,609 --> 00:21:02,269
topology in order to implement this new

476
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:04,609
path so in this case it decides you can

477
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:07,070
switch so in this case it decides<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

478
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:09,769
send an 8gb message with some

479
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:13,489
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the router closes to</font>

480
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:16,070
itself so<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the AGP adjacency this</font>

481
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:18,679
is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> link-state</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol so this match</font>

482
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:20,059
this single message that's been sent by

483
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:21,979
the controller will get flooded

484
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:23,658
throughout the whole network and even

485
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:26,149
truly<font color="#E5E5E5"> reach every single router in the</font>

486
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:27,769
network so that's easy for the

487
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:29,599
controller to speak to anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just</font>

488
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:32,839
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send it to its closest neighbor</font>

489
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:36,389
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the protocol will relay the message</font>

490
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:39,810
for him you can switch and there does

491
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:43,410
the the figuring path so we've sent a

492
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:45,480
message asking to create a fake node so

493
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:48,780
a fake router in the topology<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font>

494
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,360
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> FA and that also asked to create</font>

495
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:54,389
a fake link that links this new node

496
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,760
this new router to an existing one so if

497
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:58,680
you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this topology with a</font>

set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of weight of link weights that are</font>

499
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:05,130
on the graph if you do the work from the

500
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:07,709
control plane you can skip you are able

501
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:10,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to compute some new shortest path on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

502
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:11,790
graph so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the shortest path</font>

503
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:14,280
towards the red / fix while nothing has

504
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:15,810
changed however if you compute the

505
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,000
shortest path towards the blue prefix

506
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:21,300
well over all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a sudden you prefer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

507
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,760
use for router<font color="#E5E5E5"> a the next step fa so</font>

508
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:28,530
this new fake note that we've added on

509
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:30,150
on dhcp topology so that's well that

510
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,290
sounds great like this but that does<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

511
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,880
control plan that doesn't tell you

512
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:35,250
anything about<font color="#E5E5E5"> where is the traffic</font>

513
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,560
going this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rear rotor it's not</font>

514
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:40,320
evil connected to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> real in physical</font>

515
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:42,929
interface so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what enough go to</font>

516
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,139
the next slide so there was a there was

517
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:48,810
a third line on the adipic on da gb

518
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:52,620
message which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a physical mapping</font>

519
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:54,840
between this these fake elements this

520
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:57,840
fake node it's wiggling attached to the

521
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:01,740
router a and a real in a real physical

522
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:04,709
element in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> r1 so with this</font>

523
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:07,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">we information we have modified the</font>

524
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:09,360

00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,000
fake<font color="#CCCCCC"> note a fake note with a fake lint</font>

or<font color="#E5E5E5"> will to a physical router with speci</font>

527
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,620
we have selected<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cost that caused some</font>

528
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:19,170
new shoulders path to be computed and

529
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,179
then we have some information on what's

530
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:24,630
the actual physical interface I need to

531
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:26,160
use to reach that fake node so if you

532
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,730
have if you are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement this</font>

533
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,290
kind of features in a routing protocol

534
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:33,570
well the hope and actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the</font>

535
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:35,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">result we have is that when you switch</font>

536
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,929
from the control plane view to the data

537
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,300
plane to actually measuring the traffic

538
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:42,120
flows while you see that all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sudden</font>

539
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:45,149
you you have different<font color="#CCCCCC"> set of paths that</font>

540
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:48,540
are being used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two prefixes that</font>

541
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:50,060
share the same egress router so in this

542
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,399
case we've managed to

543
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:55,399
push to sear away the traffic towards a

544
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,850
blooper ethics / along a path at least

545
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:01,700
compared to the original situation so

546
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:04,850
that's a short of a view of what we call

547
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:07,310
fibbing which is this idea of lying two

548
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:11,840
routers in this case lying to water a

549
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:13,970
about a new a new new neighbor that

550
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,679
doesn't exist that should be reachable

551
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:19,490
with a particular cost and that's

552
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:24,050
announcing some destination prefixes can

553
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:27,200
skip there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> motive that's there's more</font>

554
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:28,669
to it so we've started with a single

555
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,910
fake note that we have added on the

556
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:34,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">graph in order to change to trigger one</font>

557
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:38,150
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> up change we could do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more often</font>

558
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,730
than that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can skip so we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change a</font>

559
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:42,890
requirement to and we want no to

560
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:45,440
implement a path that goes from a to R

561
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:48,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">12 hour 4 and 10 20 to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> blooper ethics</font>

562
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,800
and so in this case we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do to</font>

563
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:55,910
next up changes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to go on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

564
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:59,210
to first cause a to change its net up to

565
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:02,090
pick a longer and longer path to Egypt

566
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:04,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">prefix but we can we need to do we're</font>

567
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:07,419
willing we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> our one to do exactly</font>

568
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:10,220
the same so we can say we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> send twice</font>

569
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:12,050

be constructed and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow again these</font>

574
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:24,620
new shortest path that we have on the

00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:28,399
control plane and sugar on the data pin

576
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:31,000
as well there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even more to it so if</font>

577
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,560
added to fake notes on the graph and

578
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,810
well if you think of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> network that has</font>

579
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,750
let's say thousand routers if you want

580
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:41,000
to make a very complex path you probably

581
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:43,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send a thousand ls8 a</font>

583
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:48,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">that particular path so in this case</font>

584
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:51,650
with a short path and we can simplify it

585
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:54,770
so by selecting properly the cost that

586
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:56,480
we use to announce these fake these fake

587
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:58,340
notes and to link them to the to the

588

<font color="#E5E5E5">graph we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can minimize the number of</font>

intuition the arguing's<font color="#CCCCCC"> to themself are</font>

591
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:09,800
rather long but you can go to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

592
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,810
one but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take the original graph</font>

593
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:15,560
that implements the path<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we wanted</font>

594
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:17,270
so the path going over on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Left we</font>

595
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,419
are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to constrict what we call a</font>

596
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:22,250
reduced topology where we inject the

597
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,880
minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of fig fig nodes that</font>

598
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:27,950
implement the specified requirements by

599
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,440
playing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the cost of the fig note</font>

600
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:33,050
that are chained together so if you come

601
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,690
if you look yourself on the right you

602
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:37,760
will see that with the chosen<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost only</font>

603
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:39,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">the routers that are supposed to change</font>

an<font color="#E5E5E5"> X up will do so and we'll do it</font>

605
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:45,410
accordingly to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirement from the</font>

606
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:48,860
operator still leaving the path towards

607
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:51,950
the bird prefix unchanged you can go to

608
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:54,560
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next one so I've mentioned a Grange</font>

609
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:57,800
so we have two classes of algorithms we

610
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:59,600
have one that's super fast that was the

611
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,370
one we use on the left part of the

612
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,560
previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide which lets us compute</font>

613
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:05,479
segmented topologies so these typologies

614
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:09,110
on the control plate side with the new

615
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,150
elements super quickly so to give a

616
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:13,790
rough approximation on a number on the

617
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:15,770
network with about 2,000 edges and three

618
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:19,430
on three hundred routers were able to

619
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:22,400
compute a rather huge amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of change</font>

620
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:26,540
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of milliseconds rom two or</font>

621
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:28,430
three anyway able to reduce heavily the

622
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:30,050
number of fake note the number of igp

623
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:32,390
messages that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send in a</font>

624
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:34,460
network in about a second so back

625
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:36,350
playing with these two algorithm to

626
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,600
gather variable for example to react

627
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:41,120
quickly to failures so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see a</font>

628
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,520
failure we are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to compute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the new</font>

629
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,250
desired state of the network within

630
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,290
milliseconds and optimize it over the

631
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:54,650
longer run to reduce the overhead on the

632
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:56,659
routers can see so we want we<font color="#E5E5E5"> set at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

633
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:58,790
star that we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keep the</font>

634
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:01,400
desirable properties from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp so the</font>

635
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:03,110
fact that this scale a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> to huge</font>

636
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,320
networks and that they are robust to

637
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:09,199
failures so we still have this we still

638
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,720
using entrada main routing protocol as a

639
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,480
as the basis for control plane so we are

640
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,059
still able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to withstand failures if all</font>

641
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,470
of a sudden or controller fails while

642
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:20,720
network is<font color="#CCCCCC"> still working it's still an</font>

643
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:24,799
energy beer the classical one that

644
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,450
you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> using well to know and we</font>

645
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,309
can do a bit more than this you are able

646
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">to implement some form of security</font>

647
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:32,600
policies such as Phil<font color="#CCCCCC"> closed or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open so</font>

648
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:34,580
if the controller fails do I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

649
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,289
particular traffic flow to still exist

650
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,299
in the network or should it be dropped

651
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:40,970
because I can no longer in force the

652
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:42,470
sake of security policies so that's some

653
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,330
benefit that we have because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are able</font>

654
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,879
to centrally controlled a forwarding

655
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:49,189
state of the network but this is still

656
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:52,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">with an AGP with the scalability and</font>

657
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:55,100
robustness benefit and go to next one

658
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,928
and so expressivity wise for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

659
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,998
requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the operator is able</font>

660
00:28:56,929 --> 00:29:02,509
to specify to the controller we can

661
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:05,059
enforce any forwarding dag so any set of

662
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:07,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">paths that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does not create a loop on the</font>

663
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:09,139
/ destination basis and when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> say /</font>

664
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:14,899
decision basis that's a knight be

665
00:29:09,139 --> 00:29:17,479
perfect so a / 16 / 120 / full / android

666
00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:19,518
and 28 if you're in ipv6 so we have a

667
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">resolution that ranges from a single</font>

668
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,769
physical machine to a whole network with

669
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:28,039
any set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> paths without affecting the</font>

670
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:31,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">others so we believe that's pretty</font>

671
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:33,049
useful actually and so we have we have a

672
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:35,600
few use cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we developed in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

673
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:38,149
paper and in other labs and so on and

674
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll present you one here you can skip</font>

675
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:43,070
again actually and so in this case we've

676
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:46,039
built as a demo that we presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font>

677
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:48,769
month ago where we targeted the issue

678
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:52,519
with flashcards<font color="#CCCCCC"> networks so these sudden</font>

679
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:54,830
surges of traffic so for example one of

680
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:56,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">your friend of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook so a new video</font>

681
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:58,908
that is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really liked shade it to</font>

682
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:00,860
all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> its friend we did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same in</font>

683
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:02,779
Ovilus all of a sudden you have 10,000

684
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:04,580
users that all want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the exact</font>

685
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:06,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">same video came from the same</font>

686
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:09,289
geographical area and so hitting roughly

687
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:10,668
the same CDN and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> only lasts for a</font>

688
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:12,440
couple of in it because when they've

689
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:15,379
seen the video we're no longer we're no

690
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,480
longer interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and so it's</font>

691
00:30:15,379 --> 00:30:20,779
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> super hard to protect against</font>

692
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:22,730
it however you see want the people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

693
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:24,470
able to see that particle video so what

694
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:26,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">are the solutions if you skip to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

695
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:30,130
next one<font color="#E5E5E5"> well currently operators have</font>

696
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:32,350
basically not sure no choices

697
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,910
to over provision so it's super hard to

698
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:36,310
protect against an event on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font>

699
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:39,670
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> lasts for a couple of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes and</font>

700
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:41,800
probably never happens again so yeah you

701
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:44,140
buy back bigger pipes and that's all you

702
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,810
can do realistically so we wanted to

703
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:49,570
look a bit at heard the ability to

704
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:53,590
program an AGP could help to solve this

705
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:56,020
issue because the main the main reason

706
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:57,879
why you cannot really do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something more</font>

707
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,350
clever than just over-provisioning here

708
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,450
is that if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change the</font>

709
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:03,040
fighting set of GI GP as of now while

710
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:05,560
you have to reconfigure all device

711
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:08,379
independently but now we had the ability

712
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:11,290
to do it centrally so if you go to next

713
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,880
one and so we build some experiments

714
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:15,909
while in a controlled environment and so

715
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,730
we had a few videos video servers a few

716
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:21,370
well a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dozen of clients that</font>

717
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:23,650
all of a sudden wanted to try to get

718
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:26,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to a video to a stream to a video</font>

719
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:27,730
while to swing this video and we're

720
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,100
monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> the link codes in the network</font>

721
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:32,710
and the goal was there to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

722
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:37,540
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single client was able to actually</font>

723
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:40,000
view the video without stuttering and so

724
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:42,639
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually built the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> topology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

725
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,830
have see we had seen before with the

726
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,770
same set of<font color="#CCCCCC"> linkers and in that</font>

727
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:50,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular topology if you put the video</font>

728
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:53,410
servers on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tour if you attach these</font>

729
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:55,929
to the two routers a and B the 12 that

730
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:58,240
I've drawn on the right if all of a

731
00:31:55,930 --> 00:32:00,070
sudden you have a lot of clients hidden

732
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,350
behind the same perfect so in the same

733
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:05,020
residential area that all start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

734
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:06,969
to access videos coming from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

735
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,860
of the network well in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case we have</font>

736
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:11,440
a bottleneck you have a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> path</font>

737
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:14,080
that's available from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> and B towards</font>

738
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,360
see these are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sames while you just</font>

739
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,429
sum up the load over the links if you

740
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,139
get a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that's large</font>

741
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:22,300
enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> well you have a huge link</font>

742
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:24,810
utilization in balance the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network or</font>

743
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:28,659
congestion depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how big it is</font>

744
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:32,110
you can skip<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sophie being lets us</font>

745
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:34,690
program paths in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network while</font>

746
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:36,100
there's an easy fix here so we won't we

747
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:38,260
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a sudden we have an</font>

748
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,870
increased load over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same central</font>

749
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:44,169
path while why can't we just spread the

750
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:48,518
load so link set a GPS

751
00:32:44,169 --> 00:32:50,499
party simply well by default natively so

752
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:52,299
in this case the goal is well I want to

753
00:32:50,499 --> 00:32:55,059
use multiple paths for example starting

754
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:57,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">a Trotter be towards rather see well</font>

755
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:59,739
let's add a new path in the control

756
00:32:57,249 --> 00:33:01,809
plane which has the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same cost than the</font>

757
00:32:59,739 --> 00:33:03,669
old one so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fig</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Rutter</font>

758
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:06,700
that's been attached<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the router be</font>

759
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:09,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's advertised with a cost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of two which</font>

760
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:12,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the same cost than the old PAP you</font>

761
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:14,799
had which was be all to see so no rotor

762
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:18,309
be at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the control plane is able</font>

763
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:20,499
to compute two different shoulders path

764
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:22,570
towards the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix and so it's</font>

765
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:24,580
going to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use both of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them even</font>

766
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:27,519
three resulting in the load spread that

767
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:29,439
we that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have on the right we can do</font>

768
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,200
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that if you go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next one</font>

769
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:36,879
we can do the same behavior on<font color="#CCCCCC"> rotor a</font>

770
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:40,600
so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce a path of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a fake note</font>

771
00:33:36,879 --> 00:33:43,480
that rotor one with a chosen cost that's

772
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:47,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">reachable from murder a and I got the</font>

773
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:50,580
best wrong whatever we should be able to

774
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:52,809
spread the load fairly easily between

775
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:55,080
well between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two paths that are</font>

776
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:58,119
available if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do that we're able to</font>

777
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:00,759
spread the load evenly across two paths

778
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:02,918
can go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we can do</font>

779
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:05,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">even more than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> adding more and</font>

780
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:08,290
more information on the control plane we

781
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:10,059
have able for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> here to cause an</font>

782
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:12,909
even load to introduce an evil load

783
00:34:10,059 --> 00:34:16,899
balancing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> rotor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I had two</font>

784
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:19,960
different fake notes on rotor one I see

785
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:22,629
two different IP next stop for water a

786
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,480
and eventually what I have is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

787
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:27,569
have I have a splitting ratio on rotor<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

788
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:30,219
that's one further than twofold

789
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:32,710
resulting in while a much lower overall

790
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:36,209
link utilization in network if you go to

791
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:39,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">the next one so we build this experiment</font>

792
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:43,030
and recorded measurement so busy so we

793
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:46,389
had initially a single client behind

794
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:49,179
rotor see<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to access videos on the</font>

795
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:51,609
first server and over time we gradually

796
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:53,829
add added moment clients that we're

797
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:57,308
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to request video from either of</font>

798
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:57,940
the two servers eventually congesting

799
00:34:57,309 --> 00:35:01,329
the

800
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:04,660
neck links so BR to see and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

801
00:35:01,329 --> 00:35:07,569
and so we plugged our controller in fed

802
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:10,149
him with the link Claude measurements

803
00:35:07,569 --> 00:35:12,520
that we had and so over time you started

804
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:14,980
to add these new equal cross paths so

805
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:17,710
the path that<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes from B to towards r3</font>

806
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:20,470
to spread the load<font color="#E5E5E5"> once that's the first</font>

807
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:22,060
reduction the first the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop in</font>

808
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,459
bandwidth consumption that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have on</font>

809
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:27,099
the graph so at roughly 31 streams and

810
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:29,829
then again when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we started to add more</font>

811
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:32,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">and more demands from the clients behind</font>

812
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:34,900
water seeped words the second streaming

813
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:37,060
service while we added<font color="#CCCCCC"> another path</font>

814
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:41,140
starting at rotture a to decrease again

815
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:43,420
d / the / link load so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

816
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:45,279
while we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> were able to increase</font>

817
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:48,160
the available bandwidth towards rotor

818
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,290
see starting at rotor a and B so a very

819
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,210
congestion in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've been</font>

820
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:56,170
to do to react like this in milliseconds

821
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:58,569
if we start over<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the idea of flash</font>

822
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:00,640
crowds in the network well once the

823
00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:02,920
event is done what once people no longer

824
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,990
want to access the content<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we can</font>

825
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,609
just remove these extra fake elements

826
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:08,618
that we had had it previously in the

827
00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:11,109
control plane and so stop using this new

828
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:15,609
paths so we're able to change the state

829
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:18,069
of the network quite fast and just to

830
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:19,690
fix temporarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever was happening</font>

831
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:22,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">based on the policy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have from</font>

832
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:26,380
the operators should go to the next one

833
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:28,629
so I've said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we made an experiment</font>

834
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:30,819
for that so implicitly this means that

835
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:32,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get to well a working</font>

836
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:35,950
prototype so we have running code with

837
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:38,619
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of lying</font>

838
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:42,279

839
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:45,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">step selection and so this works using</font>

840
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:49,359
SPF so we're leveraging some features

841
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:51,310
found in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular GP because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">selling set IGP it's actually super easy</font>

843
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:55,420
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to bootstrap the controller</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

844
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,180
plug it into a physical router and we

845
00:36:55,420 --> 00:37:01,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">receive the whole topology directly from</font>

846
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:03,069
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ellises so that's fairly easier than</font>

847
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:05,500
with a ZN where you ever have to

848
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:07,300
reinvent everything from ml EDP to

849
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever this topology discovery</font>

850
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,190
protocol you have and we've confirmed

851
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:15,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this work</font>

852
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:17,060
against cisco iOS<font color="#E5E5E5"> Xros an accessory and</font>

853
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:20,030
journalist well the hardware that we had

854
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:23,099
so this works again current router

855
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:25,859
unmodified well we abilities to solve

856
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:29,760
the use case that wasn't before you can

857
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:34,440
go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next one so use specific types</font>

858
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:36,060
of SPF messages so you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> red ranger</font>

859
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">of link set advertisement messages that</font>

860
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:40,560
are available in ospf and more

861
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:45,359
importantly we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these two subtypes</font>

862
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:48,299
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tie 5</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 which are which enable a</font>

863
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:50,970
router to announce the rich rich ability

864
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,640
towards a specific IP prefix but also

865
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:55,470
mention a given IP next up in the

866
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:58,799
network and associated to a particular

867
00:37:55,470 --> 00:38:02,189
cost so using this set of message I can

868
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">position a fake wrote advertisement</font>

869
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:07,680
where wherever I want in a network and

870
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:10,740
select the cost so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to do this</font>

871
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,720
I'm actually proximity approximating the

872
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,700
model that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had before and able to</font>

873
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:20,569
modify the<font color="#CCCCCC"> paths that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chosen by</font>

874
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:24,118
router in the network this<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this</font>

875
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:26,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">before yeah this one this however one</font>

876
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:29,130
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> draw back from this which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

877
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:32,700
fact that we don't want yet to modify

878
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:34,500
the prodigal which is that we've seen on

879
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,810
the previous slides that sometimes we

880
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,030
want to chain to change these fake notes

881
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:40,680
so we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to trigger multiple next up</font>

882
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:43,560
changes for the same destination

883
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:46,230
prefixes so there's one sketch with<font color="#CCCCCC"> type</font>

884
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:48,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">of Alice's is that which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you</font>

885
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:50,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to send multiple lacs announcing</font>

886
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,950
rich ability for the same prefix and

887
00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:55,400
don't want these<font color="#CCCCCC"> to collide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

888
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:59,279
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have to provision</font>

889
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,690
several ospf router<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs and so when you</font>

890
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about the controller that we have</font>

891
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:04,980
in the network it's actually

892
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:08,250
multiplexing a lot of visual routers to

893
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:11,550
generate all the needed router IDs in

894
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:12,990
order to chain all of this that's one of

895
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:16,500
the limitation we currently have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the</font>

896
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:19,169
solution which will see what people

897
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">could get for cleaner solution should go</font>

898
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:23,240
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one</font>

899
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:26,140
we've run extensive benchmark also held

900
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:29,240
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cisco lab in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> brussels and so</font>

901
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:31,819
we've tested this with a hundred

902
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,680
thousand Alice's that were fed to the

903
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:36,200
routers in order to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change to cause</font>

904
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,490
farting changes and basically there was

905
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,310
no impact on the shortest path

906
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:43,189
computation so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole process of</font>

907
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:46,490
sending a GPS sending control in message

908
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:48,830
to change paths etcetera is basically

909
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:51,859
for free at least on the controller side

910
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:54,350
because well that's one of the quirks of

911
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:58,370
the ospf implementation that's a vector

912
00:39:54,350 --> 00:40:02,000
addition it heats basically no ram on

913
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:04,670
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> routers so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10,000 LSA it's about 10</font>

914
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,480
megabytes of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ram so that's close to</font>

915
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:12,110
nothing and causing triggering one

916
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,250
except<font color="#E5E5E5"> change is almost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> constant</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

917
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:16,600
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the rotors we've measured</font>

918
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:19,640
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're able to send which to cause</font>

919
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,650
100,000 next up changes in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fib in</font>

920
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:24,440
about 90 seconds so that's close to the

921
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:26,360
nine hundred microseconds per single

922
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,280
next up change that we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to set up so</font>

923
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,440
it's a cliche<font color="#E5E5E5"> / fast to do this we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

924
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to send it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to quiet update on the</font>

925
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:37,000
path to be chosen within milliseconds

926
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:40,070
and actually have them be implemented

927
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,720
I've mentioned I've started to mention

928
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:45,680
some of the drawbacks so we using

929
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:48,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">unmodified ospf well we first of all are</font>

930
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,960
limited but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I space of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SPF offers</font>

931
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:52,790
so we are not yet close to this whole

932
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,530
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of adding a fake note and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then a</font>

933
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:56,540
destination we kind of have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to group</font>

934
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:59,660
them together and plug them on the

935
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:01,310
router so if you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> look into the</font>

936
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:03,410
algorithm's while there are different

937
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:05,660
index passivity models and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

938
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:08,420
a bit harder to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do whatever we want with</font>

939
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:12,620
pure SPF than what we wanted in practice

940
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:17,150
practice there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one huge limitation</font>

941
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:18,980
which is that is PF ranks link set of

942
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:21,470
the ties meant depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the on their</font>

943
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:24,260
type and we'll ignore type<font color="#CCCCCC"> five or seven</font>

944
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:26,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">LSS if it has received another route</font>

945
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:28,040
toward the same prefix of a preferred

946
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:30,800
time so literally for example an

947
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:33,050
intra-day main road so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this to</font>

948
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,320
work while we had to do some bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

949
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,510
engineering just

950
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,710
to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's feasible into practice</font>

951
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:40,350
but obviously would like to get

952
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:42,090
something cleaner in the end and I've

953
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:43,770
spoken a lot about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ospf well that's</font>

954
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:47,190
because it doesn't work yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're ice is</font>

955
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:49,470
so we don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this ability to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send a</font>

956
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:52,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">message that gives us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reach ability</font>

957
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:55,439
towards an IP prefix given an IP next up

958
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:58,529
and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> metric so there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no way to do</font>

959
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,510
this with Isis as of now if someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

960
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:03,630
an idea on<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to develop some cleans</font>

961
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:06,210
some clean slate extension we would be

962
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:08,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and happy to look at that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

963
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:12,320
that's well we believe there's value to

964
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,319
expand this and make something cleaner

965
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:20,640
skip to<font color="#E5E5E5"> d1 and so just to conclude so</font>

966
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:23,730
we've started to look at what we could

967
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:27,480
do with disability to program path na in

968
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:28,860
nigp and the more we looked at did<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

969
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,500
the more<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do so for example</font>

970
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:35,070
we've seen that remedy able to modify

971
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:37,770
path and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost almost independently on</font>

972
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:39,810
the prefix basis well there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of</font>

973
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:42,000
protocols that we are on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the path and</font>

974
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:44,040
the curse<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are chosen by JP I gp's</font>

975
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,200
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP decision process has</font>

976
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:49,790
some criterion that depends on the cost

977
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:51,810
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rod so by doing against some</font>

978
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:54,090
feeling there we are about to control

979
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:56,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the output of the BGP decision process</font>

980
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:59,280
so in order to control a bit what would

981
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:01,770
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the path chosen by the transit</font>

982
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,340
traffic in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and make these</font>

983
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:08,070
vary over time we believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that having</font>

984
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:10,770
the ability to do this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of exception</font>

985
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:12,870
rotting can simplify the configuration

986
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:15,750
process on the routers because you could

987
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:18,180
get simpler configuration with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lotta</font>

00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:22,950
the very specific path that you need for

00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:25,770
the proof the few prefixes that recur

special treatments<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe the data</font>

992
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:31,830
centers the entire data centers traffic

993
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:35,070
that require a separate path and finally

994
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:37,890
this ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to program the network</font>

00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:43,440
us a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> new domain why we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

997
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,240
do real-time traffic engineering and so

998
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,940
there is a paper at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the upcoming</font>

999
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:52,560
connects so that's in about a month

1000
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:54,960
that implements optimal traffic

1001
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,360
splitting in the network at all times so

1002
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,550
that ensure that you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> always able to</font>

1003
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">maximize the link utilization in your</font>

1004
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:06,270
network which is fairly interesting in

1005
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:08,310
which leverage fibbing actually the

1006
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:11,340
closing remarks we have is that we've

1007
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:12,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">built this whole system centered on the</font>

1008
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,940
fact that while we have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> rotor</font>

sitting in your desk what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do with</font>

00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:20,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">this we've have this formalism of adding</font>

1012
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:27,090
the weights etc is there a better

1013
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:29,790
solution well if you have one we would

1014
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:33,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">welcome it quite a lot and we would</font>

part of this thank you questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say</font>

1018
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:55,830
Matthews so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have 2 comments first of</font>

1019
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:58,109
all your approach looks actually while

1020
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:59,670
they're similar to segment routing have

1021
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:01,500
you I don't know if you've looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1022
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:04,740
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not but it has similar problems</font>

1023
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:07,920
and similar solutions to that so just

1024
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:10,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suggestion to investigate that the</font>

1025
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:14,250
second comment is that this approach

1026
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:16,319
works well for certain types of ISPs

1027
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:18,570
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of call the classic ISPs</font>

1028
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:21,360
which run you know take<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet traffic</font>

1029
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:23,070
and run it is IP traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the core but</font>

1030
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,260
there's the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the newer class of</font>

1031
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:28,110
ISPs that don't do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore they put</font>

1032
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:30,660
them inside l3 VPNs instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

1033
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:35,130
this approach doesn't work for lv VPNs

1034
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:37,379
so so or at least not directly now you

1035
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:39,060
question is then can you modify it so it

1036
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,680
actually would work with an l 3<font color="#E5E5E5"> v's day</font>

1037
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,570
on it there so there's dew points<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the</font>

1038
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">first one was Sigmund routing yes so</font>

1039
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:46,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're actually playing with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> segments</font>

1040
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:48,210
writing on the side quad a lot more

1041
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:49,680
especially most specifically the ipv6 a

1042
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:52,380
tablet because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> d1 we are able to</font>

1043
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet colonel so we</font>

1044
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:57,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe there's different use case for</font>

1045
00:45:54,750 --> 00:46:00,660
both so<font color="#CCCCCC"> segment rotating requires you to</font>

1046
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,680
attach a header a stack of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bibles to</font>

1047
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,720
every single

1048
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,000
well if you have long<font color="#CCCCCC"> lift flow you</font>

1049
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:09,270
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not want to do it for a</font>

1050
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,190
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> or another doing an even load</font>

1051
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:13,140
balancing with Sigma working at least

1052
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:14,460
for the solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've had a Pinto</font>

1053
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:16,950
yesterday that there's anniversary for

1054
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:18,690
that but in our solution required to do

1055
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:22,109
some stateful load balancing which was

1056
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:24,180
not very stable on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ennos and we are</font>

1057
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:26,308
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to we have this idea of triggering</font>

multiple next up changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1059
00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:30,270
with a single message whereas<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:32,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">segment version you have to reach out to</font>

1061
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:33,960
every single ingress so that's a

1062
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,759
separate part but yeah segment<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing</font>

1063
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,270
is something we look into it because it

1064
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:42,410
does quite 11 interesting stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well</font>

1065
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:44,700
for the l3 VP and stuff that's the

1066
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:47,069
comment on the very last slide which is

1067
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:50,250
I believe in three VPN is dependent on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1068
00:46:47,069 --> 00:46:51,990
deep I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp for the MPLS label</font>

1069
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:54,630
propagation so that you are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to roll</font>

1070
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:57,000
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> rico well a lipid depends on the igp</font>

1071
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:59,760
to select this path well that's if you

1072
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,900
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp or if you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you use RSVP</font>

1073
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,190
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously that's a different</font>

1074
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:07,589
way I'm operators do one or the other

1075
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:09,960
yes it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's what but but still</font>

1076
00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:15,119
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it's different because you</font>

1077
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:18,319
still would want your you know you still

1078
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:21,599
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to influence how things go between</font>

1079
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:23,339
l3 VPN instances there which may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1080
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,980
different than what you want you know

1081
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:27,960
traffic other types of traffic like

1082
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:31,079
management traffic which is typically

1083
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:36,299
you know sent a straight IP traffic

1084
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:38,339
around so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think you know and you</font>

1085
00:47:36,299 --> 00:47:40,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">know in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you probably also if</font>

1086
00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:42,599
you if you do that to affect one then

1087
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:44,520
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would in fact affecting you know if</font>

1088
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:46,260
you have multiple l3v pnc presume we

1089
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:49,049
just want to change one they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font>

1090
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:51,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">to change all of them so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say</font>

1091
00:47:49,049 --> 00:47:52,680
you would want instead play with bgp you

1092
00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:55,680
rather than play with your drawing<font color="#E5E5E5"> IG</font>

1093
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:58,230
which is something we also do so we

1094
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,930
since we control the cost we can change

1095
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:04,109
the curse<font color="#CCCCCC"> that BG pcs between the</font>

1096
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:06,808
different addresses and so by again

1097
00:48:04,109 --> 00:48:09,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing some craft engineering we can</font>

1098
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:12,020
choose bid you set cause bgp to select

1099
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:14,609
to prefer one ingress over another and

1100
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:15,360
wrote the traffic towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> a egress</font>

1101
00:48:14,609 --> 00:48:17,160
differently

1102
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,710
and goes the traffic to follow it

1103
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:21,270
basically but so you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1104
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:25,050
again it sounds like you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

1105
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:27,690
about changing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP cost effect how</font>

1106
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:29,250
bgp changes but i'm saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know at</font>

1107
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:31,140
least from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my point of view i don't</font>

1108
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:33,240
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the way an operator</font>

1109
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:35,220
would want to do it instead they like to

1110
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:39,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">affect the actual l3 VPN routes</font>

1111
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:41,459
themselves for a particular l3 VPN but

1112
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:43,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm sure we can dig this stuff like glue</font>

1113
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:45,750
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe easier for me just to</font>

1114
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:51,570
draw what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think and maybe understand</font>

1115
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:55,980
what you're saying then ok ok questions

1116
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:58,970
where all the routing people hey

1117
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:02,120
everybody looks at me but nobody gets up

1118
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:02,120
allison is coming

1119
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:12,740
so you mentioned that in the paper that

1120
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:16,670
security can be handled by doing md5

1121
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:19,950
authentication in the ospf context but

1122
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:21,930
the your by introducing this fake note

1123
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:23,970
are you also allowing the possibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1124
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:27,118
other fake notes could be introduced and

1125
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:28,649
they could you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide routing</font>

1126
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,049
information you didn't intend and you

1127
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:36,569
might need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a an object-oriented security</font>

1128
00:49:31,049 --> 00:49:38,849
rather than appear type security so so

1129
00:49:36,569 --> 00:49:43,589
the md5 mentioned that we made in the

1130
00:49:38,849 --> 00:49:45,299
paper is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> statement that yeah maybe it</font>

1131
00:49:43,589 --> 00:49:47,700
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> poorly phrased but we have the</font>

1132
00:49:45,299 --> 00:49:49,740
controller that's seen by all the

1133
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:53,308
routers in the network just as one of

1134
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:56,250
them it is tablature normal RGB a GP

1135
00:49:53,309 --> 00:49:57,660
adjacency so we shared the md5 key

1136
00:49:56,250 --> 00:50:00,599
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the controller and all the</font>

1137
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:03,720
routers and from then on it's seen as

1138
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:05,990
the same ospf area to put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way</font>

1139
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:08,490
and so the message<font color="#E5E5E5"> we sent our</font>

1140
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:10,558
authenticated because that the operator

1141
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:12,629
himself that set up the controller

1142
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:16,020
there's no possibility for someone else

1143
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:18,780
to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> an LSA that would not be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

1144
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:20,839
identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess if you if you're going</font>

1145
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,309
to operate that would be good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1146
00:50:20,839 --> 00:50:26,369
detailed explanation of how not to

1147
00:50:23,309 --> 00:50:27,990
introduce a risky situation to the

1148
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:39,000
network but thank you thanks for that

1149
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:42,839
comment this is uh you broke it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1150
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:46,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">right did you guys not get enough coffee</font>

1151
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:49,339
in the break it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank</font>

1152
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,339
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much</font>

1153
00:50:52,320 --> 00:51:00,040
second hook and can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> try your dongle</font>

1154
00:50:55,930 --> 00:51:08,009
for the next talk since this one I guess

1155
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:08,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now the battery slideshow</font>

1156
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:38,320
let's see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this works better want to</font>

1157
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:38,320
check

1158
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:56,010
I guess it's my mac all right do the

1159
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:58,569
next slide thing and it keeps me awake

1160
00:51:56,010 --> 00:52:01,030
all rights like the second talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> Benjamin</font>

1161
00:51:58,569 --> 00:52:03,910
husband's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also from all us group in at</font>

1162
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:07,510
UCL<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's also doing quite a bit of mptp</font>

1163
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:09,368
stuff there yep thank you eat the

1164
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:13,450
microphone go very close and pointed at

1165
00:52:09,369 --> 00:52:16,990
your mouth a bit total for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay like</font>

1166
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:19,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this is a joint walk</font>

1167
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:22,419
with gravy do tell Sebastian ballet

1168
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:26,800
clothes on oops like this yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raphael</font>

1169
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:30,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">Buddha</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and already been around 30 so and</font>

1170
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:34,390
I self but announcements from UCL so

1171
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:37,328
let's go to the first side so we are

1172
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:39,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to see first the very simple</font>

1173
00:52:37,329 --> 00:52:42,040
scenario in which we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a smartphone</font>

1174
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,260
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the left side and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also on the right</font>

1175
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,880
side and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to establish the</font>

1176
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:49,420
connection between your smartphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1177
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:51,339
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server so if you are using plain TCP</font>

1178
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:55,900
what will happen is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you will have</font>

1179
00:52:51,339 --> 00:52:59,109
to do establish one pass next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font>

1180
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:02,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">please and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will have to choose</font>

1181
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:05,348
between the Wi-Fi or next tide you will

1182
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:09,130
use the LTE but you will not be able to

1183
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:11,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">use the two together so with MP TCP what</font>

1184
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:14,140
you will be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is on the next</font>

1185
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:17,680
slide you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to use the two so</font>

1186
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:20,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically it adds a layer between the</font>

1187
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:25,660
circuit and TCP interface so I'm ptcb

1188
00:53:20,829 --> 00:53:27,940
lies in there and next slide and what is

1189
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:31,540
exactly multipath TCP this is a regular

1190
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:33,670
TCP extensions that a low packets

1191
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:36,970
belonging to one connection to be sent

1192
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:41,650
over multiple paths so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is described</font>

1193
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:44,890
inside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC 6824 the next slide</font>

1194
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:47,829
please and the idea is that we do not

1195
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:49,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">change the socket interface so for the</font>

1196
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:51,220
applications this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the same</font>

1197
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:54,009
and you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do any</font>

1198
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:54,520
modification inside the application it

1199
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:57,820
will

1200
00:53:54,520 --> 00:54:00,160
oddly use MPD CP by default and this is

1201
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:03,100
completely hidden to the application so

1202
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:08,440
next I please this one one of the

1203
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:11,380
objective design in mp<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp we want to</font>

1204
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:14,020
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> a modified application so let's</font>

1205
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:17,080
go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next side but there are</font>

1206
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:18,790
various uski is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality so first you</font>

1207
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:21,420
may have different plans so on the first

1208
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:23,290
side we saw that we could it could be a

1209
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:26,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">smartphone but it could be able to</font>

1210
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:29,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">router or next side again a smartphone</font>

1211
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:31,750
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> it could be also a laptop on the next</font>

1212
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:33,879
slide that's not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only thing that</font>

1213
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:35,410
could happen some other stuff may also

1214
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,210
be different so if you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font>

1215
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:41,170
side sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this you will have to</font>

1216
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:43,870
switch it up so the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server side will</font>

1217
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:46,180
also be quite different so in the simple

1218
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:47,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">serio scenario you have only one server</font>

1219
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:50,080
but you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in a case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where you</font>

1220
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:52,210
have a load balancer so this may also be

1221
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:54,779
a problem for MP tcp on the next slide

1222
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:58,720
you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could also have</font>

1223
00:54:54,780 --> 00:55:00,940
multiple type of interface so for

1224
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">instance you can have a Wi-Fi interface</font>

1225
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:05,290
which is really different from a

1226
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:08,710
satellite link so for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

1227
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:11,160
have a really different a TT maybe the

1228
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:13,540
bandwidth will be very different<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

1229
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:17,710
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to aggregate them all together</font>

1230
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:20,380
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a bit odd next time we can</font>

1231
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:22,870
also see that the network cannot concede

1232
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:24,820
be considered to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dump pipe anymore</font>

1233
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:27,940
so we have a lot of middle box that can

1234
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:30,430
for instance play with all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

1235
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:32,860
options and in this case the MP<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

1236
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:35,319
options and on the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide we can</font>

1237
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:37,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">also see that there are many application</font>

1238
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:40,030
for instance that could have really

1239
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:43,300
different needs and they may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

1240
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:45,700
MP TCP differently depending on the

1241
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:47,920
needs and on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next I'd we can also</font>

1242
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:50,410
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you have all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1243
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:53,500
you may also have some interface that

1244
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:56,170
have cost constraint constrained sorry

1245
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:58,690
you may also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> security constraint</font>

1246
00:55:56,170 --> 00:56:00,490
and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you go to the next slide</font>

1247
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:03,670
you will see the big picture you have

1248
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:06,640
all of this that could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be different use</font>

1249
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:07,990
cases for MP<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP and the conclusion of</font>

1250
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,810
this is the

1251
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:13,450
on the next slide we probably need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1252
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:14,980
adapt MP<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP based on the context so if</font>

1253
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:18,160
you have really different context

1254
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:21,580
probably we should try to tune MP tcp to

1255
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:24,430
adapt to the different needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's go</font>

1256
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:27,430
to the next slide we will first now

1257
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:29,740
introduce a bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> DMP tcp for</font>

1258
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:32,049
everyone just to have a basic idea of

1259
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:34,299
how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works and especially we will talk</font>

1260
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:37,300
about the implementation inside the

1261
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:41,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">Linux kernel so our next slide we can</font>

1262
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:44,110
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> NP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP itself inside the Linux</font>

1263
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:47,230
kernel is already divided in small

1264
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:50,860
modular and for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have two</font>

1265
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:53,560
specific model which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is which are the</font>

1266
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:55,330
past manager and<font color="#CCCCCC"> schedule</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so those are</font>

1267
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:58,029
two specific model that we can change

1268
00:56:55,330 --> 00:57:01,779
inside the colonel to adapt the behavior

1269
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:04,030
of mptp based on the need so on the next

1270
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:06,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">slide we will start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain what is</font>

1271
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:09,790
the what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the responsibilities of the</font>

1272
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:12,160
past manager so first the past manager

1273
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:14,619
will establish what is called the<font color="#E5E5E5"> master</font>

1274
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:17,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">so flow so master cyl flow is the first</font>

1275
00:57:14,619 --> 00:57:19,570
up flow established for the MP TCP

1276
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:21,670
connection this one is a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific</font>

1277
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:25,090
because you negotiate the option during

1278
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:27,730
the first flow and in those option you

1279
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:31,869
will also exchange some material to be

1280
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:34,270
able to reuse after to join the

1281
00:57:31,869 --> 00:57:38,680
connection with different source and

1282
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:41,320
destination IP so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see here</font>

1283
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:44,200
that you exchange the key and<font color="#CCCCCC"> both the</font>

1284
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:46,869
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the server keeps the the key</font>

1285
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:49,569
so on the next slide we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> also see</font>

1286
00:57:46,869 --> 00:57:52,330
that the past management the vast

1287
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:54,700
majority sponsible to establish the

1288
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:56,890
additional sub though so to establish an

1289
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:59,980
additional central you have another MP

1290
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:02,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP option which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called join you will</font>

1291
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:05,170
use we will reuse sorry the key that you

1292
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:09,490
exchange in on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> masters of flow to</font>

1293
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:12,609
join the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> MP TCP connection okay and</font>

1294
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:16,140
our next slide you can also see that you

1295
00:58:12,609 --> 00:58:19,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">are able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> play with what is called</font>

1296
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:21,980
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> up sub flow so back up is not</font>

1297
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:23,900
really defined in Saudi FC just

1298
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:25,670
back up and then the implement the

1299
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:27,920
implementation needs to know what to do

1300
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:31,100
with those kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sub flow so this is</font>

1301
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:33,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">also a decision of the past measure the</font>

1302
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:35,960
next slide we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can also see that the past</font>

1303
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:37,970
manager will receive some events from

1304
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,859
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection so for instance what can</font>

1305
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:42,890
happen say the multipath TCP connection

1306
00:58:39,859 --> 00:58:45,319
one of the sub flow may be destroyed for

1307
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:47,150
some reason so for instance one middle

1308
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:49,160
box could send the reset or anything

1309
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:51,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">like this and the past manager will</font>

1310
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:54,440
receive an even and it will react upon

1311
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:57,890
decisions so other stuff may still

1312
00:58:54,440 --> 00:59:00,680
happen but here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk about the</font>

1313
00:58:57,890 --> 00:59:03,109
second component this modular<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside in</font>

1314
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:06,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">the MPD</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CV implementation and this one</font>

1315
00:59:03,109 --> 00:59:09,410
is called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the schedule so in this one</font>

1316
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:11,750
when you have a queue of packet to send

1317
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:15,020
over multipath TCP connection you first

1318
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:17,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to decide which packet will be sent</font>

1319
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:19,910
next so it's not clear that you want you

1320
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:24,020
want to send the head of the of the of

1321
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:25,129
the queue first because if the tooth of

1322
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:27,380
flow have really different

1323
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:29,930
characteristic it may be interesting to

1324
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:32,900
send them out of order such that they

1325
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:35,118
will arrive in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the receiver so</font>

1326
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:37,400
first you pick the the packet that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1327
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:41,600
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send in the second time on the</font>

1328
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:43,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide we decide on which sub floor</font>

1329
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:46,940
we want to send this packet once we have

1330
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:49,270
once we have decided we send the packet

1331
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:52,990
over the sub flow on the next slide and

1332
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:57,020
we add a specific multipath TCP option

1333
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:59,209
that will map the TCP sequence number to

1334
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:03,020
the MP TCP sequence number so we have

1335
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:05,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> level of sequence number and inside</font>

1336
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:08,240
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NPT cdss option we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the mapping</font>

1337
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:12,560
between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP sequence number and the</font>

1338
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:16,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">MP TCP sequence number so we can go to</font>

1339
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:18,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next side so if you are just a small</font>

1340
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:21,380
summary of everything that is modular

1341
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:25,130
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> already explained all the little so</font>

1342
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:28,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can switch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next side and this</font>

1343
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:31,369
is a great thing we know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> MP TCP is</font>

1344
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:33,799
modular so you can switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> some part of</font>

1345
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:35,690
it inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the colonel but the problem is</font>

1346
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's still inside</font>

1347
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:40,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">colonel and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's still really hard to</font>

1348
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:44,569
develop new module inside the colonel so

1349
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:47,390
we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring all the modularity from</font>

1350
01:00:44,569 --> 01:00:50,270
the colonel and push it up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the to the</font>

1351
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:52,160
user space so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea really of this</font>

1352
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:54,400
work is try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move the pass manager</font>

1353
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:58,549
from the colonel side to the user space

1354
01:00:54,400 --> 01:01:00,560
so the result of it should be that it

1355
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:03,020
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more easy and more flexible</font>

1356
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:04,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the user to develop new pass manager</font>

1357
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:07,730
and it will it should ease the

1358
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:11,930
development so let's go to the next side

1359
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:14,060
and now we will briefly describe the

1360
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:16,250
solution at a really high level just to

1361
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:18,470
have an idea of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's implemented we</font>

1362
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:20,690
have one part that is implemented inside

1363
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:22,669
the kernel space and the other bodies

1364
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:25,579
implemented this side user space so

1365
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:29,480
let's go for the kernel space we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1366
01:01:25,579 --> 01:01:32,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">module that replace the past manager on</font>

1367
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:34,730
top of the already<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing interface</font>

1368
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:37,099
inside the colonel<font color="#E5E5E5"> and instead of taking</font>

1369
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:39,319
any decisions let's go to the next slide

1370
01:01:37,099 --> 01:01:41,510
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do instead of taking any</font>

1371
01:01:39,319 --> 01:01:44,270
decision if we have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> event from the</font>

1372
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:46,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">apt speaker no we translate this event</font>

1373
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:49,759
into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> message and we will put this</font>

1374
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:52,640
message on to a net link so net link is

1375
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,920
a protocol that able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use that will</font>

1376
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:57,348
let you send message from the colonel to

1377
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:59,300
use space so we just pack the

1378
01:01:57,349 --> 01:02:00,800
information inside the message and we

1379
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:04,940
will send the information into<font color="#E5E5E5"> user</font>

1380
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:06,800
space phonetic so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an example of</font>

1381
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:10,190
even that we could have so for instance

1382
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:12,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mptp channel could say hey I've got</font>

1383
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:14,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">a su flow that is destroyed and the</font>

1384
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:15,530
module instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taking any decision we</font>

1385
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,740
just pack the information inside a

1386
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:22,480
message and send it to user space so on

1387
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:25,310
the other side what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can also do is</font>

1388
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:29,480
listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the message cut that comes</font>

1389
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:31,849
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user space so the model itself</font>

1390
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:33,920
will listen from use of<font color="#E5E5E5"> space and you</font>

1391
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:37,880
can receive new messages that it will

1392
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:39,619
translate into MP<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP actions so the</font>

1393
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,990
example for this one on the next slide

1394
01:02:39,619 --> 01:02:44,359
is create a new subfloor so the user

1395
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:46,578
space will tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> a I need a new subfloor</font>

1396
01:02:44,359 --> 01:02:48,680
we will pack the message send it the

1397
01:02:46,579 --> 01:02:49,370
module and the module will translate the

1398
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:52,669
message in

1399
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:55,700
2mb tcp actions suggest such that a new

1400
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:59,810
subfloor will be created<font color="#E5E5E5"> so after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1401
01:02:55,700 --> 01:03:01,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have on the next slide the user space</font>

1402
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:05,509
implementation so in user space we just

1403
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:09,400
add a library that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to listen to</font>

1404
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:12,020
the applications themselves and the

1405
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:13,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">application can send a message to the</font>

1406
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:15,800
library and the library<font color="#CCCCCC"> will translate</font>

1407
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:19,160
the message to<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing so let's go for</font>

1408
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:21,200
the example so again just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> library</font>

1409
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:24,319
just listening and will translate it all

1410
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:27,439
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who NP tcp on the other</font>

1411
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:30,110
way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next slide we have also the</font>

1412
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:32,720
same thing on the reverse pass and the

1413
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:35,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">library itself allows an application to</font>

1414
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:38,870
register call backs so that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> an events</font>

1415
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:41,569
happen it will call the application to

1416
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:44,870
tell to tell the application<font color="#E5E5E5"> i I've got</font>

1417
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:47,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">a new event so again I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a</font>

1418
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:49,700
small example on the next slide so this

1419
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:51,470
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same as previously so the</font>

1420
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:53,240
supplies destroy it goes through the

1421
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:55,279
module then to the library in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1422
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:58,189
library itself call back the application

1423
01:03:55,280 --> 01:04:00,740
to tell the application that we have a

1424
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:04,490
sub from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is destroyed alright so</font>

1425
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:06,560
let's go to the next slide so no we have

1426
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:09,379
the basic solution that has been

1427
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:12,230
described we will go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to simple use</font>

1428
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:14,210
case to simple use cases so if you have

1429
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:17,120
any question I forgot to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you these</font>

1430
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:19,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">acts now because I didn't go into</font>

1431
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:20,720
details for the implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if</font>

1432
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:25,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have any question about the</font>

1433
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:27,350
implementation is asked right early so

1434
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:29,750
for the use case we have two of them

1435
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:33,140
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> file we will start with the first</font>

1436
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:35,060
one let's go for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first one you are</font>

1437
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:36,890
in a simple scenario where you have a

1438
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:40,250
smartphone and you have a Wi-Fi access

1439
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:43,250
and lt access and you want to connect to

1440
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:45,080
your server so in today's implement

1441
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:46,880
implementation you will use the default

1442
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:50,870
pass manager which is called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the full</font>

1443
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:53,930
mesh this pass manager will open a soup

1444
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:57,170
flow over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> default interface on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1445
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:59,690
next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then immediately after</font>

1446
01:04:57,170 --> 01:05:01,850
you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> also open another sub flow on</font>

1447
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:02,630
the backup interface even though<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does</font>

1448
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:05,180
not plan to

1449
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:08,210
use it so it will still open this

1450
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:10,940
subproblem so know if the smartphone

1451
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:15,680
user is moving away from the access

1452
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:18,170
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then yes sorry for it yep so</font>

1453
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:20,299
if the smartphone users is moving away

1454
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:22,819
from the access point what could happen

1455
01:05:20,299 --> 01:05:27,440
is the sub flow could become really

1456
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:30,319
really slow and if the sub flow is still

1457
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:32,809
there and PT CP will still consider it

1458
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:36,619
as active and you will not send any data

1459
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:38,390
on the backup interface one of the

1460
01:05:36,619 --> 01:05:41,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that is important here is that</font>

1461
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:43,640
slow is somehow subjective and we don't

1462
01:05:41,539 --> 01:05:47,299
know where they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider</font>

1463
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:49,009
subfloors slow so this might be this<font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

1464
01:05:47,299 --> 01:05:52,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">depends in the application for instance</font>

1465
01:05:49,009 --> 01:05:54,170
so if you are using a small application

1466
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:56,329
that does not exchange mini data slow

1467
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:58,190
can be enough for instance but if you

1468
01:05:56,329 --> 01:06:01,250
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at youtube video for</font>

1469
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:02,930
instance maybe just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kilobyte will</font>

1470
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:07,069
not be enough and you will need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

1471
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:11,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">the backup interface so we'll go to the</font>

1472
01:06:07,069 --> 01:06:14,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one so how do you explain that so</font>

1473
01:06:11,269 --> 01:06:16,729
the two issue here the sub flow is

1474
01:06:14,509 --> 01:06:18,740
established really too early we

1475
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:21,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">establish it whenever we don't need it</font>

1476
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:23,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">and when we need it we do not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font>

1477
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:27,230
because we never define exactly what is

1478
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:30,890
a slow suffer so let's go to the next

1479
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:32,539
slide so now we have implemented

1480
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:35,029
something different we propose something

1481
01:06:32,539 --> 01:06:39,049
different and we implemented inside user

1482
01:06:35,029 --> 01:06:41,750
space and what we propose is to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1483
01:06:39,049 --> 01:06:44,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">same default interface establish the</font>

1484
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:47,119
subfloor just as before but now in this

1485
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:49,099
case we are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the backup</font>

1486
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:52,549
interface we will not establish any sub

1487
01:06:49,099 --> 01:06:55,460
sub flow on this one so let's go to next

1488
01:06:52,549 --> 01:06:59,779
and then we still have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same issue</font>

1489
01:06:55,460 --> 01:07:03,259
the smartphone is still moving away from

1490
01:06:59,779 --> 01:07:05,690
the Wi-Fi access but now we detect that

1491
01:07:03,259 --> 01:07:08,990
the subfloor is considered as slow so

1492
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:11,180
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will do now is open a new</font>

1493
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:13,160
subfloor on the backup interface and we

1494
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:15,839
do not describe it as a backup and we

1495
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:20,069
will start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it immediately</font>

1496
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:23,250
so now we have those those two different

1497
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:25,170
so the difference is we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not establish</font>

1498
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:28,290
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> backup in the interface immediately</font>

1499
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:30,750
and then when we detect the slow sub

1500
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:33,300
flow we open a news of when we use it

1501
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:36,000
immediately so let's go to a small

1502
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:38,460
experiment so said that is the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1503
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,700
described in text so we can go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1504
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:43,020
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide so we have still the same</font>

1505
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:46,169
experiment let's go to the next slide

1506
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:48,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we will just exchanged a small file</font>

1507
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:51,420
from the smartphone to the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1508
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:53,940
let's go to the next slide and<font color="#E5E5E5"> after one</font>

1509
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:55,740
second we will emulate the move away

1510
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:57,480
from the Wi-Fi access without thirty

1511
01:07:55,740 --> 01:08:00,959
percent losses on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> default in the</font>

1512
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:03,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">first and then we will compare the two</font>

1513
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">solutions so the today's solution which</font>

1514
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:07,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the default pass manager inside the</font>

1515
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:09,750
kernel which is called full mesh and our

1516
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:13,380
solution that we called<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> backup</font>

1517
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:16,290
redefinition so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1518
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:18,270
sequence number evolution of the two

1519
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:20,490
days<font color="#CCCCCC"> pass manager what will happen so</font>

1520
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:24,420
here we have a graphic with the sequence

1521
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:27,240
number on the y axis and the time on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1522
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:29,819
x-axis and what you can observe<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is</font>

1523
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:32,550
the sequence number at the MP<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP level</font>

1524
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:35,279
so in green<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the master</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> soup</font>

1525
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:38,790
flow and in red you have the backup sub

1526
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:41,130
flow so here you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we are not</font>

1527
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:43,410
using at all the backup interface even

1528
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:46,830
if it's there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the Greens of flow is</font>

1529
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:49,229
still in use even though it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1530
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:51,779
slow and we do not manage to terminate

1531
01:08:49,229 --> 01:08:54,509
the connection so let's go to the next

1532
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:57,000
slide so here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see all the TCP with</font>

1533
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:58,859
transmission so at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point we know</font>

1534
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:04,560
that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a problem but we do not do</font>

1535
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:08,400
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the time to exchange the</font>

1536
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:10,589
file is really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> long so let's go</font>

1537
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:14,189
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slide and I already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say that the</font>

1538
01:09:10,589 --> 01:09:17,670
backups of flow is not used but if we

1539
01:09:14,189 --> 01:09:20,069
use a new definition of backup what will

1540
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:22,319
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> is at start it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the same</font>

1541
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:25,170
we open the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mastership flow we exchange</font>

1542
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:27,569
a lot of data and then after one second

1543
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:29,000
we have losses if equal to the next

1544
01:09:27,569 --> 01:09:31,790
slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see them</font>

1545
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:35,450
we have losses and the RTO is growing

1546
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:37,790
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> MP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP is well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the user space</font>

1547
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:40,339
base manager detect that the RTO is

1548
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:42,560
growing and we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> open a new sub flow</font>

1549
01:09:40,339 --> 01:09:44,240
and then we will use immediately this

1550
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,310
user flow and we will be able to

1551
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:51,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">terminate the connection in this case in</font>

1552
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:54,800
four seconds yeah so in this case we

1553
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:56,929
complete the exchange of the file and on

1554
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,880
the previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> case we did not complete so</font>

1555
01:09:56,930 --> 01:10:01,130
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the left side we should</font>

1556
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:04,460
go up to 10 if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to terminate the</font>

1557
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:06,200
exchange of the file in the default case

1558
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:08,300
in the girl in the current

1559
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:10,730
implementation it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even possible to</font>

1560
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:13,700
terminate the connection because MPG CP

1561
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:15,769
with still try to exchange you data over

1562
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:18,139
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> flow even if it's not working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other side in the user space</font>

1564
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:23,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">place manager because we detect the RTO</font>

1565
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:26,990
we are able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open a new subfloor and</font>

1566
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:28,940
use it immediately so that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1567
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:32,389
the first use case that we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1568
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:35,000
present and the benefit in this case is

1569
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:36,350
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably save some energy on the</font>

1570
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,780
smartphone because you don't need to

1571
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:41,810
open and use of doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> immediately you</font>

1572
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:44,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably save money because you</font>

1573
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:46,460
still have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to in the first class you see</font>

1574
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:48,830
left to exchange the scene in these kids

1575
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:51,500
in some some of the case you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will not</font>

1576
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:53,960
even exchange the scene and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1577
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:57,710
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a faster recovery so on the</font>

1578
01:10:53,960 --> 01:11:00,520
next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll go to the second to</font>

1579
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:05,300
scale so this one is totally different

1580
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:07,460
let's go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first side so this is a</font>

1581
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:10,910
completely different use case for MP<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

1582
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:14,840
MP TCP could be used when stands in data

1583
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:17,059
in data centers even if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> clients and</font>

1584
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:19,880
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server have only one interface is</font>

1585
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:23,720
still possible to use MP TCP so in this

1586
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:26,480
simple topology we have ecmp on the next

1587
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:31,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">side and what we will do we will use the</font>

1588
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:33,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">IP port source and destination and you</font>

1589
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:37,550
will urge them to to decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> on which</font>

1590
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:40,009
pass you will send the sub pro so for

1591
01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:42,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">instance the idea behind this one you</font>

1592
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:45,440
can you can open a first<font color="#E5E5E5"> so flow and we</font>

1593
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:47,330
go on the first pass and then you will

1594
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:49,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">open a second step flow you will go on</font>

1595
01:11:47,330 --> 01:11:51,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> second pass and then a third one and</font>

1596
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:53,540
fold one and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is that you will</font>

1597
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:57,620
aggregate all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> values of all the bus</font>

1598
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:59,870
with that so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know if it works</font>

1599
01:11:57,620 --> 01:12:03,800
on that so let's try a small experiment

1600
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:06,530
again and we use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> topology and</font>

1601
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:08,630
we exchanged a file over this<font color="#E5E5E5"> topology</font>

1602
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:12,219
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> measure the completion time so</font>

1603
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:15,530
maybe good the next one yes so we just

1604
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:18,260
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> five as a parameter for n default so</font>

1605
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:22,099
it means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five sub flow</font>

1606
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:25,070
on this particular topology so here the

1607
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:27,140
result of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> completion time of all the</font>

1608
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:32,179
experiment and we can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are</font>

1609
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:34,700
three tricky cases so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened in</font>

1610
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:37,460
this case what will see it on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

1611
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:39,769
slide so there is nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> prevent all</font>

1612
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:41,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sub-code to go to the same pass</font>

1613
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:44,000
actually because you don't know what is

1614
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:46,759
the ash function<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly so what may</font>

1615
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,440
happen is that also<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw me and on the</font>

1616
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,780
same path and at this point they will

1617
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:55,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">not agree get banned if they will share</font>

1618
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:58,490
the same path so if also flow use the

1619
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:00,830
same pass you will not gain anything so

1620
01:12:58,490 --> 01:13:03,920
let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the result he actually</font>

1621
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:08,050
what we did is that we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 code</font>

1622
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:12,530
sorry we found two out of the four pass

1623
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:14,300
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found only we found free on the</font>

1624
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:16,730
next slide we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> three of the four</font>

1625
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:21,260
pass and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually found all of the</font>

1626
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:23,480
pass on the on the last one<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so can</font>

1627
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:25,910
we do something better by implementing a

1628
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:28,549
new pass manager<font color="#E5E5E5"> in user space yes we</font>

1629
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:30,889
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can try to do something so the</font>

1630
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:33,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea is trying to detect when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two sub</font>

1631
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:35,450
throws share the same path so in this

1632
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:39,380
case we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to move the</font>

1633
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:42,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">orange pass until</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the second link so how</font>

1634
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:45,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do that we have a proposition so</font>

1635
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:48,530
instead of just opening an nu sub flow

1636
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:51,770
what we do is we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opening the</font>

1637
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:55,300
same numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> up flow but then every T</font>

1638
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:56,599
seconds which must be defined we will

1639
01:13:55,300 --> 01:14:00,199
measure

1640
01:13:56,599 --> 01:14:03,019
we will just take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the pacing</font>

1641
01:14:00,199 --> 01:14:05,030
rid of all the sub flow and then take

1642
01:14:03,019 --> 01:14:07,760
the sub flow with the lowest pacing rate

1643
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:10,188
closing this some flow and then open and

1644
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:13,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">use it flow and the hope is that we will</font>

1645
01:14:10,189 --> 01:14:14,449
find the sub flow that is on that all

1646
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:18,019
the subfloor that are on the same path

1647
01:14:14,449 --> 01:14:20,808
and then try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find all the paths so</font>

1648
01:14:18,019 --> 01:14:24,169
let's go to the next one so we retake

1649
01:14:20,809 --> 01:14:27,079
the same experiment and we compare the

1650
01:14:24,169 --> 01:14:28,939
two solution on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next slide and like</font>

1651
01:14:27,079 --> 01:14:33,079
we can see here is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with all</font>

1652
01:14:28,939 --> 01:14:36,159
solution we push the completion time to

1653
01:14:33,079 --> 01:14:40,099
the left and we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> always small s</font>

1654
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:42,579
finding all the pass but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comes at a</font>

1655
01:14:40,099 --> 01:14:45,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost on the next slide because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we re</font>

1656
01:14:42,579 --> 01:14:49,009
establishing news of relief why

1657
01:14:45,409 --> 01:14:52,938
currently we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> often in the slow start</font>

1658
01:14:49,010 --> 01:14:55,340
phase of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP so we are losing a bit</font>

1659
01:14:52,939 --> 01:14:57,619
of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the best</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possible time but</font>

1660
01:14:55,340 --> 01:15:00,590
overall we are still pushing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1661
01:14:57,619 --> 01:15:03,619
completion time to the left so we can go

1662
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:07,820
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one so that's it for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the use</font>

1663
01:15:03,619 --> 01:15:10,339
cases and now we just take a few time

1664
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:12,679
few minutes to describe this circuit

1665
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:14,479
implementation so on the left side you

1666
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:17,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the solution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that has been</font>

1667
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:21,019
presented inside the paper so you have

1668
01:15:17,959 --> 01:15:23,629
the specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> model the library and in a</font>

1669
01:15:21,019 --> 01:15:26,030
lot of stuff so this one is quite huge

1670
01:15:23,629 --> 01:15:27,679
and is quite flexible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on the right</font>

1671
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:30,108
side you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the circuit option</font>

1672
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:33,169
solution so this one is much much easier

1673
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:37,129
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually what we did is extending</font>

1674
01:15:33,169 --> 01:15:39,648
the socket interface inside the Linux

1675
01:15:37,129 --> 01:15:42,010
kernel so you have a systems of circuit

1676
01:15:39,649 --> 01:15:46,129
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> already defined and you have</font>

1677
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:49,309
gettin sick and<font color="#E5E5E5"> set suck up for this</font>

1678
01:15:46,129 --> 01:15:51,499
circuit and we extend those<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font>

1679
01:15:49,309 --> 01:15:53,749
to control MPDC be directly from the

1680
01:15:51,499 --> 01:15:57,320
application so now you no longer have

1681
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:59,809
all this auxiliary staff you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1682
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:04,369
control immediately from the application

1683
01:15:59,809 --> 01:16:06,469
to to the colonel<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a small</font>

1684
01:16:04,369 --> 01:16:10,009
example so this was intended for the

1685
01:16:06,469 --> 01:16:12,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">patent so we did it during the I cotton</font>

1686
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:15,080
this weekend we use the API and we

1687
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:17,809
produce as some some result if you are

1688
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:21,830
interested we have a list of result that

1689
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:23,930
we had this weekend so from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> see good</font>

1690
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:26,000
you had just able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font>

1691
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:29,750
structure and put the address over there

1692
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:32,060
and just create a new sub though with a

1693
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:35,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">regular get scoped so let's go to the</font>

1694
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:37,370
next here is the just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a simple list of</font>

1695
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:39,889
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you could do now in user</font>

1696
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:42,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">space through the socket API so</font>

1697
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:44,960
basically you are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a list of</font>

1698
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:48,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the sub though you are able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

1699
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:51,110
which software use which address and

1700
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:54,400
port and you are also able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> open and</font>

1701
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:57,679
close the flow inside the user space

1702
01:16:54,400 --> 01:17:00,559
yeah let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the next one so in</font>

1703
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:04,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">conclusion what we add here is a new</font>

1704
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:07,340
flexible API proposal for MP<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP past</font>

1705
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:11,750
management and we have some use cases to

1706
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:14,000
prove that is possible to do and we

1707
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:16,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it may be useful in the future to</font>

1708
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,650
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to have more deployment for MP</font>

1709
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:21,230
TCP so another diplom the deployment is

1710
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:23,240
quite small even if it started<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1711
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:26,059
still quite small and we think that with

1712
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:29,120
this kind of API we could have a larger

1713
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:31,580
deployment so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test it is</font>

1714
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:34,430
possible MP<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP is always available at</font>

1715
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:37,280
will be pasty speed at all and socket

1716
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:39,710
API is also available on the mailing

1717
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:41,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">lists on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have also a</font>

1718
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:44,210
virtual machine that is available<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1719
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:47,330
multi passes feel awkward so you can

1720
01:17:44,210 --> 01:17:49,280
just try it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

1721
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:52,870
one I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have any</font>

1722
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,870
question I would be happy to answer them

1723
01:17:57,540 --> 01:18:14,410
questions while we're never going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1724
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:16,420
this on monday again yep do you plan to

1725
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:18,849
extend the API to be more high-level

1726
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:22,330
available for example for browsers or

1727
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:24,340
something yes so when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> designed the</font>

1728
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:26,670
API we had a lot of questions such as

1729
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:30,580
what should be the right abstraction and

1730
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:32,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's we find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard to get</font>

1731
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:34,960
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of what the application will</font>

1732
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:37,750
want so instead of having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a liar and a</font>

1733
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:39,520
high level API we started with<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

1734
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:41,650
simpler with the idea that we could

1735
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:45,790
build something more complex and more

1736
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:53,620
abstract with this simple API so we will

1737
01:18:45,790 --> 01:18:55,269
do it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> as for sure so um it seems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1738
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:56,530
the application<font color="#CCCCCC"> will need to gain a</font>

1739
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:58,120
whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of knowledge about the</font>

1740
01:18:56,530 --> 01:18:59,559
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> scenarios it can be and in</font>

1741
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:00,880
order to do this effectively right i

1742
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:02,140
mean the data centers<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be a special</font>

1743
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,840
case because there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a pretty</font>

1744
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:06,790
rigid topology but but an application

1745
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:09,250
that runs on an end system<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's you</font>

1746
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:10,480
know we carry around<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right could</font>

1747
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:11,800
find itself in very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very different</font>

1748
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:15,219
environments and so it would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1749
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:17,710
implement quite a bit of smarts yeah so

1750
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:21,040
one of the use case that we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1751
01:19:17,710 --> 01:19:22,630
present it was the streaming use case so

1752
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:25,180
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance if you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you need</font>

1753
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:27,130
minimal bandwidth you can stick to one

1754
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:29,980
sub for as long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the minimal</font>

1755
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:32,980
bandwidth to exchange the file to to get

1756
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:34,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">the video streaming and if you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1757
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:36,580
you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be too slow you start for</font>

1758
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:38,500
instance to open<font color="#CCCCCC"> an user flow inside the</font>

1759
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:40,540
application to get fast enough so that

1760
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:42,850
the video<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not stopping for instance</font>

1761
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:46,300
so that's something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font>

1762
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:48,970
more for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application itself hmm I'll</font>

1763
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:51,070
keep going if nobody else goes um so you

1764
01:19:48,970 --> 01:19:53,080
in your example so it was always<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1765
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:54,670
client that was doing stuff yeah do you

1766
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:57,970
have an MP TCP sec on the server which

1767
01:19:54,670 --> 01:20:00,400
also has this API and which can also try

1768
01:19:57,970 --> 01:20:02,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to express its wishes yeah and what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

1769
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:04,960
the two down the line what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1770
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:06,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">what if the two logics on the client and</font>

1771
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:09,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the server try to do different things to</font>

1772
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:09,799
the connection through the API<font color="#E5E5E5"> on each</font>

1773
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:11,780
side

1774
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:15,710
yeah that's also something that we

1775
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:18,290
discuss it seems that at some point we

1776
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:20,420
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do have a mechanism to</font>

1777
01:20:18,290 --> 01:20:21,760
exchange the high level requirement

1778
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:25,580
between the server and the client

1779
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:28,970
probably so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could also start to</font>

1780
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:31,519
insert new mechanism to let the server

1781
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:34,370
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client talk outside of the data</font>

1782
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:37,880
or the over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP option for instance</font>

1783
01:20:34,370 --> 01:20:39,410
to know what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> their objectives it</font>

1784
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:42,230
might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> always help right so for</font>

1785
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:45,769
example if<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have the so if the</font>

1786
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:47,120
server would prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use there a path</font>

1787
01:20:45,770 --> 01:20:48,410
that goes through appearing link for

1788
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:50,930
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> right well the client would</font>

1789
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:52,790
prefer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use one that it gives better</font>

1790
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:55,640
performance but<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not appearing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> linked</font>

1791
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:59,690
to the provider wins right or<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

1792
01:20:55,640 --> 01:21:02,750
come to yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> yasha um do we have an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

1793
01:20:59,690 --> 01:21:06,950
of how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they play out I mean it</font>

1794
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:09,350
would just be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ping-pong thing or no I</font>

1795
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:12,019
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should be able to define how to</font>

1796
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:13,790
resolve the conflict before it's pink as

1797
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:18,260
you said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure how to</font>

1798
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:22,880
resolve the concession<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right any</font>

1799
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:24,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions from you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in which</font>

1800
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,630
case we're all very early at whatever

1801
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:30,040
break comes next thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much and</font>

1802
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:30,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">see you in Chicago</font>
