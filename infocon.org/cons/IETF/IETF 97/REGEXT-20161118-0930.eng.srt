00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:04,020
please don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> forget that this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

37
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,390
generic message about document review

<font color="#CCCCCC">request</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean this working group in</font>

39
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:12,510
general does suffer a bit from activity

40
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">level I guess or engagement level we</font>

41
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,100
really have a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> small group</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of us who</font>

42
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:19,350
are actively engaged<font color="#CCCCCC"> in taking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care of</font>

43
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:22,769
documents I think that's partly just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

44
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:24,660
reflection of<font color="#E5E5E5"> who in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF is really</font>

45
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:28,110
paying close attention to registration

46
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:31,230
issues so it works kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a victim of</font>

47
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,550
circumstances but you know they've had

48
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,200
this message up before you hopefully

49
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:38,130
have seen this in other working groups

50
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,079
you know please do um you know take the

51
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,549
time to review documents not just ours

52
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,490
but documents and other working groups

53
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:46,140
to everybody appreciates the reviews

54
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they get from different people in</font>

55
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:52,019
different contexts always a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good thing</font>

56
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:54,030
this is the eye chart which tells you

57
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,200
what our agenda is if you actually can

58
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,240
read it or you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at the slides</font>

60
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,020

00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">business because it all just adds up</font>

64
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,640

documents will take a quick look first

100
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:49,289
at documents which are already<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

101
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:52,110
publication q let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about draft EPP</font>

102
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:54,240
extensions key relay since I think that

103
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,879
one's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have some attention here</font>

104
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,129
and it really is the IPR issue let me

105
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:03,509
take a moment first just to explain

106
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:06,529
where we are and what the process is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

107
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:09,870
ITF just to be clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> has an IPR</font>

108
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:12,269
notification system<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it doesn't</font>

109
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:15,149
otherwise interfere with the other with

110
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:17,729
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF process so it's an honor system</font>

111
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:19,620
you know if you believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you are</font>

112
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:21,300
aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can be anyone doesn't</font>

113
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,889
necessarily have to be your employer

114
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,110
could be something that you discovered

115
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:27,769
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone else did there are folks</font>

116
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,509
who have done that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you simply can</font>

117
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:32,490
request there's a form that you fill out

118
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:34,889
and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a notification up that</font>

119
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,019
there is potentially some kind of IPR

120
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,959
that is related to a document and in

121
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:42,089
this particular case verisign themselves

122
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:45,029
has an application for a patent that is

123
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:46,619
that is active and they have simply you

124
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:49,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">know put a notice up that says that it</font>

125
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:53,039
might apply in this case and the

126
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:55,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">situation is that it's an application</font>

127
00:06:53,039 --> 00:07:00,119
that's pending it hasn't been issued yet

128
00:06:55,339 --> 00:07:02,699
and so far speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> now as working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

129
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:05,280
chair what I understand about the status

130
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,560
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> document is that although people</font>

131
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,119
have no objection<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the document there</font>

132
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,200
was some<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion on the mailing list</font>

133
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,990
where people were not generally in favor

134
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,539
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving the document forward without</font>

135
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:21,570
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of indication of what licensing</font>

136
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,919
terms might be for the IPR now it's

137
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:26,310
important understand that there's no

138
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,960
obligation for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the owner of the patent</font>

139
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,630
in this particular case or the patent

140
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,539
application in this case to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say anything</font>

141
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:36,270
about licensing terms and the working

advisement the fact that potential IPR

144
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:44,520
exists so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working group</font>

145
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:47,310
to decide to move this forward without

00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:50,430
any specific indication of licensing

147

licensing terms become made available

when the patent<font color="#E5E5E5"> is issued right now the</font>

151
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:08,039
way I am reading the discussion on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

152
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,140
mailing list is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is not an</font>

153
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,090
overwhelming amount of support for

154
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:15,740
moving this document forward with

155
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:18,419
essentially undefined licensing terms

156
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,979
the document authors of course would

157
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:23,219
very much like to see this thing move

158
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:25,169
forward and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know they're really</font>

160
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:29,250
about you know how they really feel

161
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,470
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I mean does the working group</font>

162
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,179
really want to wait it is a working

163
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:37,050
group document this group does get to

164
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:41,218
decide I mean as a as a consensus call I

165
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:42,870
am I am as<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group chair in this</font>

166
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,540
particular case<font color="#E5E5E5"> Antoine is one of the</font>

167
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,660
authors of the document so he is

168
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,310
refusing himself from this particular

169
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:54,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion or at least his role as chair</font>

170
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:55,560
in moving this document forward but I

171
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,940
guess I'm opening the floor for

172
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,550
discussion if anyone wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm interpreting working group</font>

174
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,380
consensus as holding this document back

175
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,380
for right now until we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are aware of some</font>

176
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:09,600
licensing terms I don't know if anyone

177
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the group would like to to support it</font>

178
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,620
differently that the authors have very

179
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,770
clearly spoken on wanting the document

180
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,360
to move forward but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I feel like if we</font>

181
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,740
can't get support from

182
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,230
others in the working group are doing

183
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,930
that the document needs to wait until

184
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:28,829
the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> Patent Office works its process</font>

185
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:31,260
out and then we can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they're</font>

186
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:34,680
assigned will offer up some licensing

187
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:38,880
terms so here's our ad listen please go

188
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:41,760
ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alyssa Cooper um I'm kind of</font>

189
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,980
surprised because at least in the latest

190
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">round</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry these microphones like</font>

191
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:50,730
they're electric static obviously I've

192
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,610
new to the group so i guess i should say

193
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,790
first everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think knows Alexei and</font>

194
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:59,310
I have swapped roles here so this is a

195
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:02,370
whole new area for me so please be

196
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:04,469
patient but um and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I don't know the</font>

197
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,540
whole history<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the previous discussion</font>

198
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,209
but at least in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> latest discussion on</font>

199
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:13,560
the list I've only seen support for

200
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:15,750
moving forward so can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you maybe provide</font>

201
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:20,010
a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> further explanation or</font>

202
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:21,660
labia mystery document authors I i think

203
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:24,600
the support to move it<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward was just</font>

204
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,219
from the document authors and the couple

205
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,440
other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that spoke on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the list were</font>

206
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,790
other people in the working group and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

207
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,410
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for someone other than just</font>

208
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the document authors to want to move it</font>

209
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward if people want to challenge me</font>

210
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,769
on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular process that's fine</font>

211
00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:39,569
but that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm just feeling like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd</font>

212
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:41,670
rather see overwhelming support within

213
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:44,610
the working group as a whole not just

214
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">from document authors keeping my eye on</font>

215
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:50,040
the me dekho here so someone also please

216
00:10:46,430 --> 00:11:02,370
wave if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to miss it see if</font>

217
00:10:50,040 --> 00:11:06,510
anyone wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to speak about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this this is</font>

218
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:08,070
all this from is and i think i would

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the document move forward i</font>

220
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:15,240
think yeah yeah can I think we shouldn't

221
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,860
discuss the API in itself but I think it

222
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:22,980
is worth moving forward it's a document

223
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:25,279
we need yeah okay thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you thank you</font>

for that

225
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,820
this is all over from clutter can we

226
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:44,950
have a sense of the room of what people

227
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:46,750
think about this issue yeah this

228
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:50,590
microphone is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not designed for 12 people</font>

statuses and I went ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and made those</font>

283
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,769
updates and republish so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe the</font>

284
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:27,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">state is the fact that it's waiting for</font>

285
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:30,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">real review from I Anna from I Anna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

286
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,579
yeah I wasn't sure if another write up

287
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:35,620
was needed work or not but ok so this

288
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:37,089
document is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much all but</font>

289
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,850
published it's just in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last little</font>

290
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:46,689
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of processing on the on the is GI n</font>

291
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:48,160
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so maybe that's one Alyssa</font>

292
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:54,519
just to call to your attention in

293
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:56,199
particular Alyssa Cooper I'll check<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

294
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">Alexei Alexei is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still shepherding that</font>

295
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:00,490
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it was before the changeover</font>

296
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:14,079
but I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just poke him real quick and</font>

297
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:17,589
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next set of documents or</font>

298
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,420
documents in working group last call so

299
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:21,750
we had the launch phase and tmch

300
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,389
functional spec documents which were

301
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:27,339
unfortunately tightly coupled together a

302
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:29,050
normative reference issue we have

303
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:30,910
actually resolved that we got a

304
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,649
suggestion to separate that so the

305
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:35,259
launch phase is no longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> dependent on</font>

306
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:37,569
the tmch functional spec so it should be

307
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:39,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">ready</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to move</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forward I'm not aware of</font>

308
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:41,079
any objections and I think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

309
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,610
waiting for right up for that right we

310
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:44,019
have a document<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shepherd and we just</font>

311
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,810
need for that to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get submitted to the</font>

312
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:50,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">isg we've had our last call so that one</font>

313
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:52,300
is ready to go so the unfortunate thing

314
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:54,279
is we have the tmch functional spec

315
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,889
document which is in a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

316
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:58,329
different state we have had some

317
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:01,240
discussion on the mailing list I know

318
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:04,540
it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly between gustavo and and</font>

319
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:08,310
patrick fallstrom the issue here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

320
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:11,230
it specifies some matching rules and

321
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:14,349
patrick has issues with the fact that it

322
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:18,610
specifies matching rules references<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

323
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:20,589
them that are ill-defined and I think

324
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,680
that given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that seems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a fairly</font>

325
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:25,689
substantial technical objection in in my

326
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,638
view<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think that holds up this</font>

327
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:30,099
document the problem is I don't really

328
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:32,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">know a path forward to this the problem</font>

329
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:35,009
is really on the I can't side not on the

330
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">IETF side as I understand it gustavo</font>

331
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:41,189
because it's the it's the rules<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

332
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:43,689
exist on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> itm side which have a flaw</font>

333
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:45,339
would you agree with that or do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

334
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:47,110
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different view no yeah that's correct</font>

335
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:49,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">i mean the matching rules</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those are</font>

336
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:52,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">different and where to find a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font>

337
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,569
using the icon process and there are

338
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:58,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">also other potential issues with body</font>

339
00:16:55,569 --> 00:17:01,059
and handling I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand</font>

340
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:03,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">the issues from I mean that Patrick is</font>

341
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:04,119
racing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I'm going to do is I'm</font>

342
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:06,039
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a conversation with</font>

343
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:08,289
Patrick to see if I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand the</font>

344
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:10,599
issues so I can propose some solution on

345
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:12,039
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Middle East so in the following</font>

346
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:14,948
weeks my idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a conversation</font>

347
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:17,319
with Patrick to see if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can better</font>

348
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:20,049
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is going on there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

349
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:24,970
also another issue with some values in

350
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:27,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">the draft that so one of the values</font>

351
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,960
regarding the expression of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

352
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:30,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">acknowledgment of the notice and the</font>

353
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,960
other one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the value related to the</font>

354
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,840
expiration of the actual team notice

355
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,750
itself those values that are in the

356
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,730
draft probably should have been in a

357
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:45,820
police document within the icon world

358
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:48,100
they end up being<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft so I have</font>

359
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:52,750
an idea on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to resolve their issue my</font>

360
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:55,570
idea is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically say that then there</font>

361
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:59,110
needs to be an expedition of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual</font>

362
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:01,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">acknowledgement of the notice and just I</font>

363
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:04,780
mean say that and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> add a note saying</font>

364
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,750
in the teutuls 2012 crown of utilities

365
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,139
the value was 48<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

366
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,000
that

367
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,680
so that is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

368
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,210
default value in the draft but it's

369
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,990
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> like like an implementation</font>

370
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:19,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">note of what was used during the round</font>

371
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:21,340
so in the future if the icon policy

372
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,720
wants to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that value is fairly</font>

373
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:27,159
easy because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> referencing a</font>

374
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,560
draft as at the fall hard coded value so

375
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:32,110
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to work in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font>

376
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:35,100
that regard and I will talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> with Patrick</font>

377
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:38,290
to see if I can understand your issues

378
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:41,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right thank you that seems to</font>

379
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:43,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sense to me too but um yeah this is</font>

380
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:46,179
in the spirit of you know we tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

381
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,920
have very limited expertise in some of

382
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:50,560
these things and especially with<font color="#E5E5E5"> idn so</font>

383
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,170
um really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do need for you and Patrick to</font>

384
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,000
see if you can resolve this together and

385
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:59,770
then we can move this document forward

386
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,330
to so uh but the launch phase will just

387
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:03,639
get that right up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that submitted</font>

388
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:06,939
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg and see that when moving</font>

389
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:09,190
forward and the launch phase will keep

390
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:12,040
back in the working group here it'll

391
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:14,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">just become a working document come out</font>

392
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,909
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> last call and we'll wait for Gustav</font>

393
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:28,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">on Patrick to sort out what they're</font>

394
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:30,820
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok next set of documents so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

395
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:33,130
could do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in two parts these are</font>

396
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,010
documents which are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

397
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:37,930
principle active in the working group

398
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:40,930
and so the first one is we did have the

399
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:42,520
regex bundling registration folks will

400
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,100
hopefully recall that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of put</font>

401
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,340
that one on hold because we realize it

402
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually could be very well recognized</font>

403
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,459
as a separate document<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm looking</font>

404
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:54,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">around ning or you oh there you are okay</font>

405
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,980
so um but we did have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> buff this time</font>

406
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,720
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's on hold in this working</font>

407
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:01,330
group because we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> this mob</font>

408
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,430
discussion it could potentially be its

409
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:05,409
own work item and then we would take

410
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,880
this document and move it over there<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

411
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,220
be in that other group if it turns out

412
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,320
it's another working group but we

413
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:14,110
thought we would do here in this case is

414
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:19,419
give a quick report on what happened in

415
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:21,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">that DNS bundled buff so if you will</font>

416
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:25,060
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> here to the</font>

417
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:38,080
pink box I will get your slides up for

418
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:40,540
you yeah does a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very quick brief</font>

419
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,210
introduction about what happens you

420
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:46,680
wednesday morning about how buff I think

421
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:53,200
maybe most of you attended that buff and

422
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:56,320
next place and during this<font color="#CCCCCC"> buff I recap</font>

423
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,560
the barbells in Berlin and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

424
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,830
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem state statement</font>

425
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:05,879
document and now and then we show

426
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:08,830
several different use case from the

427
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,110
differently registries and from one

428
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:14,770
let's start be very big red<font color="#CCCCCC"> hearts</font>

429
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:18,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">godaddy and next please and during the</font>

430
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:22,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">Baath discussion and most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people think</font>

431
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:25,450
that is a problem and but this problem

432
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:28,330
may be very proud and very complicated

433
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:31,110
and most people maybe think that this

434
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:34,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem comes for a derived from the</font>

435
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:39,250
application layer so people think that

436
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:42,310
with now the PS draft not have a very

437
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:46,780
clear problem statement and the scope is

438
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:50,530
not as clear and now and people even

439
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:54,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">challenge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us that why should we think</font>

440
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:56,560
about it to solve this problem at the

441
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,860
nest layer and people because people

442
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:02,110
think that this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe is very</font>

443
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">proud very complicated at the</font>

444
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:08,620
application layer so that's a big

445
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:11,139
challenge and for the next step we think

446
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:14,500
that first we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should make try to make</font>

447
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:18,670
the our problem statement as clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

448
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:21,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible and we want more discussion in</font>

449
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:24,370
the mailing list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we I think</font>

450
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:28,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe we try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make some running code</font>

451
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:33,580
and test bed to prove what kind of

452
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:35,110
problem we want to solve and I think

453
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,780
maybe

454
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:42,129
this this focus is a little difference

455
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:45,910
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rag extend scope is it's just</font>

456
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:49,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">my personal understanding because just</font>

457
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:52,780
as I mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> panda the domain</font>

458
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:56,170
name can be a very broad scope you can

459
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:58,330
contains not only the provisioning layer

460
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:02,710
the registration layer and but also

461
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:06,220
there may be there in a slayer but

462
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:08,919
because people all understand what is

463
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:12,390
the mandolin domain names and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user</font>

464
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:15,520
do want to get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> band out about a</font>

465
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:19,059
package of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the band or domain name so I</font>

466
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:22,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">think whether or not the buff is that</font>

467
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:26,040
domain name a bandit ball is clear not

468
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:29,049
but the requirement<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the register</font>

469
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:32,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">Banerjee domain names of our working</font>

470
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:35,440
group i think is clear so in my opinion

471
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:38,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we do not need to really need to</font>

472
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:42,910
wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the buffs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Staters and we can</font>

473
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:45,250
move forward our registration layer of

474
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:52,059
our working group document is my

475
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:54,820
personal idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> Commons hi thank you yeah</font>

476
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:56,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">godaddy did participate in this and you</font>

477
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,010
are I'm rich murderer with godaddy thank

478
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:03,510
you for the reminder we did participate

479
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:05,799
in this with Ning and see I'm Nick and

480
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:08,650
I'm one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the people that thinks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

481
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:10,780
there could be a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> robust dns</font>

482
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:14,830
bundling definition instead of use cases

483
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:17,520
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think one of them is a very one of</font>

484
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:21,100
very valuable ones is the scenic a

485
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,929
desire to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of sameness in</font>

486
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,340
the way that resolution works for let's

487
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:27,490
say ID ends of traditional and

488
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:29,350
simplified chinese etc so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want</font>

489
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:33,370
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the complex be the enemy of the</font>

490
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:34,990
simple and think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we ought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to I just</font>

491
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:38,229
didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us to find this</font>

492
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:40,600
project is being done when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> come up</font>

493
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:42,040
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a solution for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the simple case but</font>

494
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,550
I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to try to solve</font>

495
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:47,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the world's bundling problems and</font>

496
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:48,200
delay the solution of the simple case

497
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,029
either

498
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,549
I'm keeping we should focus on getting

499
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:54,080
that simple case to find simpler case I

500
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:58,220
have been told it's not simple but

501
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,408
anyway thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you for that</font>

502
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,090
and I what let me emphasize one thing on

503
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:03,559
the bottom it says and on the bottom of

504
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,360
this one slide here keep discussing in

505
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:08,870
the mailing list just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clear that's</font>

506
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,000
the DNS bundled mailing list it's you

507
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:12,739
know sets and standard IETF mailing list

508
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">DNS bundled the name of the bath and</font>

509
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:18,830
please do join that list and continue

510
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:24,919
the discussion there I the plan here is

511
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:26,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ning and I will be providing a</font>

512
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:28,130
revised problem statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> there to</font>

513
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:32,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue the discussion at it out of the</font>

514
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:34,279
bond to this list eventually yes assume

515
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:36,620
go from verisign<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did at end of off I</font>

516
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:39,500
did not speak there but the way I see

517
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is I see it in two different areas</font>

518
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,490
one on the provisioning side and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

519
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:48,649
something specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this group</font>

520
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:50,330
could tackle on the DNS side where in

521
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:52,039
essence register on could<font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font>

522
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,949
relationships<font color="#CCCCCC"> or bundling between</font>

523
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:57,500
different domain names i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

524
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:59,750
otoscope for this working group but may

525
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,649
be very interesting elsewhere I think

526
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:05,210
it's a problem that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were looking at</font>

527
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:06,709
actually thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that that just to</font>

528
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,320
be clear that was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons why</font>

529
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:10,789
we sort of put this on hold and let this

530
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,490
bot go off it just seemed like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

531
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:15,830
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> split and and let the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS stuff</font>

532
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:18,649
you know take shape elsewhere and we'll

533
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:20,870
see how that plays out Alex<font color="#E5E5E5"> my offer I</font>

534
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:23,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">just rather quickly i agree with what</font>

535
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:25,459
Jim said I think that the provisioning

536
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,100
site is out of scope of DNS model it

537
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,889
seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion all went around dns</font>

538
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,299
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can happily move</font>

539
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:35,418
forward with on the provisioning<font color="#CCCCCC"> side</font>

540
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:36,950
with whatever we like to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we</font>

541
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:38,899
should maybe consider the outcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

542
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:41,840
that up I mean we can still create an

543
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:43,459
updated version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> um whatever we want</font>

544
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do with regards to bundling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

545
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:47,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">registration site</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you just said</font>

546
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:49,279
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not understand from</font>

547
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:51,679
what Jim said so I just just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for clarity</font>

548
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,779
here so um we're back to talking about

549
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,190
the registration bundled document that's

550
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,899
here you think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should move forward</font>

551
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:59,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">with that not hold while we're waiting</font>

552
00:26:56,899 --> 00:27:01,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">for this path this this work to connect</font>

553
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,659
some seeing nodding heads but

554
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,150
go ahead yes Jim gold I say it's

555
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:10,200
worthwhile to look on the registration

556
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:15,840
side and continue on that document<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

557
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:18,330
so i take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that here take the point here</font>

558
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,010
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should hold this document and see</font>

559
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:22,260
if we can move it forward in this group

560
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:23,760
the registration bundling and then

561
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,920
separately we have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BOP that goes on</font>

562
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,090
which we can continue to report on in

563
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,790

the first is we and the simplest one

616
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:48,920
needs we just have an ID and the name

<font color="#CCCCCC">registrar because they see them may have</font>

some overlapping features

628
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:33,530
and next please and we collected all the

629
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:36,740

632
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:48,409
provisioning objects and it's the most

633
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:52,280
minimum viable product but without

634
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:57,470
consider the issues of ID unique things

635
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:59,750
and the name changes and on the last

636

00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:07,990
so-called anti-pattern<font color="#CCCCCC"> its debt which</font>

639
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:11,000
consists of the copying data which its

640
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:13,610
authority for registrar's and the push

641
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,420
the data to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> registry to just display</font>

the name at a registry level and next

643
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:28,330
week um and the second choice we can

644
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:33,649
reuse contact our object but the

645
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:35,570
reseller and the context of objects may

646
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:39,920
have an output overlapping features

647
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:44,060
between them but on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rosella may have</font>

648
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:50,050
some uniqueness it may have contacts<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

649
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:55,960
our contact<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a type a type</font>

650
00:32:50,050 --> 00:33:00,980
element element next please and the are

651
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:04,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the option c new result object and I can</font>

652
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:07,780
see one advantage meant of doing in this

653
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:12,770
way is that it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> flexible way to</font>

654
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:14,960
extend other features such<font color="#CCCCCC"> as maybe you</font>

655
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:18,730
don't know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one to display names</font>

656
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,780
of fuse and the you have other

657
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:24,520
requirements such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you want to</font>

658
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:28,370
display<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reseller email URL at</font>

659
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:32,590
addresses and it's much more easier in

660
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:35,120
this way to to do this and are

661
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:37,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">encouraging about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the registrar's also</font>

662
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,229
said I'd mentioned before the security

663
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:42,890
policy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the report</font>

664
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:47,480
options for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reseller and add a</font>

665
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:53,570
registry<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple next please and the</font>

666
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:56,929
Duster choices we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> object with</font>

667
00:33:53,570 --> 00:34:03,530
different type robes well we may have

668
00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:05,600
many rubs in the registry registration

669
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:08,800
process we can have registrants

670
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:14,029
registrar reseller and also yes operator

671
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:17,240
but it's a row type of entity but they

672
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:20,619
all have<font color="#E5E5E5"> their uniqueness and although</font>

673
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:30,168
they may have some some overlapping

674
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:34,909
features and so uh here here Oh what we

675
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:38,690
got here and I think it's better to

676
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:40,970
think about which way we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and</font>

677
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:45,470
the words the future direction for the

678
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:47,509
real reseller drafts and<font color="#CCCCCC"> OH we'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

really desire for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to continue so if</font>

707
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:15,810
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about defining a reseller</font>

708
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:17,130
and allowing registrar's to populate

709
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:19,740
that in the registry let's make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

710
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:21,869
useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> for other things as well so my</font>

711
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,700
proposal is to create it as an object

712
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:27,109
but to make all the attributes other

713
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:29,549
than the name optional so<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore if</font>

714
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:30,960
registrar's want to populate this

715
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:32,970
information they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and do</font>

716
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:37,770
that but we have an extension point that

717
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:42,950
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> better serve them okay thank you</font>

718
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:46,619
thanks Alex sorry guys Alex my offer um

719
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:50,189
with flexibility comes a great

720
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:51,599
complexity so especially in combination

721
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:54,150
with all the other things that we have

722
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">an epp already adding yet another object</font>

723
00:36:54,150 --> 00:37:00,480
that is hyper flexible to do all kind of

724
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,079
polishing on the registry all kind of

725
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,060
settings in whatever way yet another

726
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:09,000
dimension of complexity and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font>

727
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:11,609
industry which in turn makes it a

728
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,800
chartered support for registries it

729
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:17,279
creates a wide variety of implementation

730
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:20,220
variance for registers to support so

731
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,040
registrar's will probably hate it yeah

732
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:24,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">just because the only thing they love to</font>

733
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,640
do it they love to keep customer support

734
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:28,619
off their back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying okay I'm my</font>

735
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,549
loved ones responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> Israel's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reseller</font>

736
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:36,420
so I like simple things and I'm worried

737
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:40,079
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the complexity of creating yet</font>

738
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:44,030
another policy expression language in

739
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:49,500
EPP that has implications on whatever

740
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:51,510
RDS DNS maybe payment yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate limiting</font>

741
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:54,780
on the EPP interface I don't know yeah

742
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:56,550
if resellers are so eager about

743
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,500
connecting to the registry and doing

744
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:06,530
their thing why don't they simply get

745
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:10,410
their own account um

746
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:11,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jody conquer from godaddy um I i'm</font>

747
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:13,379
wondering first if there's a fifth

748
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:15,720
option here and it's just an option of

749
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:19,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">just sending in uh the reseller I</font>

reseller ID to be connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a contact</font>

753
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:28,620
a host and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> domain yet our tap only</font>

754
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,629
requires it for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> domain it doesn't</font>

755
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">require it when it's when it's listed</font>

756
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,900
it's just for the domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe I</font>

00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't believe it's on the host or the</font>

758

contact I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wondering if that's</font>

759
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:45,120
correct or if I'm out of line anyway um

760
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:47,850
I agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alex I have that right I</font>

761
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:50,790
agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alex that this is adding a</font>

00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:52,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of complication um you know having</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintain a reseller object at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

764
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:57,330
registry is just something that godaddy

765
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:59,160
would never do I mean we have our own we

766
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:02,069
have enough problems with you know

767
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,339
contacts<font color="#E5E5E5"> domains hosts and adding</font>

768
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:06,870
another object is just very complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

769
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:08,520
you know turning<font color="#E5E5E5"> off a reseller at the</font>

770
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:10,529
registry when we turn it off in our

771
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,520
systems that's all we need I mean we're

772
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:13,260
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep track of all our</font>

773
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,230
financials and everything else with the

774
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:18,630
resellers in our database and that

775
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:24,660
really isn't anything that we would

776
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:26,880
transmit to the registry so then do you

777
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:29,220
have a comment on his suggestion about

778
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,620
just getting the name to the to the

779
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:34,109
create as opposed to um actually I

780
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:37,710
haven't think clearly about it just to

781
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:41,670
have a name in the reseller extension is

782
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:44,280
enough for us to you I think me maybe we

783
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:49,620
can discuss that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a flying I think it ID</font>

784
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:51,780
is required thanks next so start<font color="#E5E5E5"> wagon</font>

785
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:55,020
just to answer questions from yo<font color="#E5E5E5"> D yes</font>

786
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:58,040
in the CLE policy the reseller is only

787
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,040
required for domain names

788
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:07,970
Pekovic just on a pure 30k view<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found</font>

789
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,480
it strange and i'm not in favor of or

790
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:13,640
against the reseller object but if that

791
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,430
exists<font color="#E5E5E5"> i found it strange that we do not</font>

792
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,870
have a register object it means like a

793
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:20,299
reseller is more important that I

794
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:23,660
registrar if we have a reseller object

795
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:26,540
another register object so on a model

796
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:28,279
kind of view I find it strange if we

797
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:30,170
have a result object or not a register

798
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,570
object I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that I want our</font>

799
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:37,400
object but if we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> strange</font>

800
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:43,790
not to<font color="#CCCCCC"> averages the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> object well loaded</font>

801
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:46,550
Patrick um Alex my over again the

802
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:50,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">maximum amount of information I want</font>

803
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:53,360
about reseller in the registry is a new

804
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,240
contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll essentially reusing the</font>

805
00:40:53,360 --> 00:41:00,650
same contact object that's as much as I

806
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:02,899
would want to see ya not more complexity

807
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:05,000
than that because the contact is

808
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:08,120
essentially garbage in garbage out

809
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:12,080
already anyways yeah besides some policy

810
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:13,730
validation on the contact but then I

811
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,380
agree with Patrick why is a reseller

812
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:17,600
suddenly so much more important than a

813
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:19,280
registrar just because there is no

814
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,799
contractor in relation with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the registry</font>

815
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,530
is that a weird way of polishing things

816
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,680
on the technical level where they should

817
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:33,470
actually be done on a different level I

818
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:34,819
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it hi Scott Hollenbeck I want</font>

819
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:36,830
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of on Patrick just</font>

820
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:39,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">said and it might be helpful to think</font>

821
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:42,290
about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we tackle this issue in the</font>

822
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:44,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">definition of our DAP right are def does</font>

823
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:47,380
not have a notion of registrar or

824
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:50,780
reseller we have this notion of entity

825
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:52,970
right and entities can have roles so if

826
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">we do decide to go down this path of</font>

827
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:57,589
continuing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to define some new type of</font>

828
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:59,240
object i would not necessarily want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

829
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:01,550
see something that is very specifically

830
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,009
and narrowly scoped as a reseller<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

831
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:05,810
would be more<font color="#E5E5E5"> in favor of you know</font>

832
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:07,580
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with some type of a mapping</font>

833
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:10,880
for an entity that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have multiple</font>

834
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:14,660
roles where's my<font color="#E5E5E5"> friend Oliver over</font>

835
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,700
there right so we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this no</font>

836
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,980
of service provide other types of

837
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,930
service providers right who actually

838
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:23,090
play a role in this ecosystem and so

839
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:25,220
there's yet another example of something

840
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,690
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a registrar or a reseller</font>

841
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:29,779
for which there may be purpose of

842
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:31,610
identification right but then this gets

843
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:34,040
us back again to why are we talking

844
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:37,310
about this at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all is the whole idea</font>

845
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:40,160
simply to include a little bit of text

846
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:42,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a who is or are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DAP response you</font>

847
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,940
know some type of a name and if so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

848
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:48,190
should be thinking about the minimal

849
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:48,190
amount of work required<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get us there</font>

850
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:59,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">larissa is I think you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asking for a</font>

851
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:02,720
whole nother<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of hell by talking</font>

852
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:05,390
about financial and reporting things

853
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,689
like that I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that any two of</font>

854
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:09,770
us in this room will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the same</font>

855
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:15,140
requirements for financial information

856
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:17,870
or reporting and other things we will we

857
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:20,210
will need several years figuring out how

858
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:22,910
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should combine that into one document</font>

859
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:26,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's just I don't see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that happen at</font>

860
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:29,210
all I think we really need this very

861
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:32,270
minimal if we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> something at all we</font>

862
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:36,470
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> really let it be as minimal as</font>

863
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:38,330
possible I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a moment</font>

864
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:40,250
to insert myself in the queue here if I

865
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:43,130
can just just for a moment I have a

866
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:44,480
suggestion um I actually had this

867
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:45,710
question earlier but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear</font>

868
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">what some of the discussion was in the</font>

869
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:51,680
room and and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> leading question about</font>

870
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:53,620
who else needs this besides you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

871
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,299
drove now what I'm going to suggest i

872
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:59,750
think this working group actually can

873
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:01,820
serve two roles and that was all part of

874
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:03,950
its charter when it was created<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean</font>

875
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:05,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">its principal role is always one of you</font>

876
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:08,120
know do we need an extension<font color="#E5E5E5"> that needs</font>

877
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,800
to be standardized in the industry so a

878
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,330
lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to do it and it</font>

879
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,620
needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be available and so we want to</font>

880
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:14,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure we get a lot of review for</font>

881
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:17,180
that so that hits the standards track

882
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:20,330
and goes out that way but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think of a</font>

883
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:22,940
path for this mmm the second role for

884
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:25,640
this group is also<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in general to</font>

885
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,960
review new ideas and new suggestions for

886
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,430
things because you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had the</font>

887
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,320
expertise here so we

888
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:32,629
click comments and<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font>

889
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,490
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that the path to publication</font>

890
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:36,830
here is not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes on to the</font>

891
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:38,359
standards track but you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just get an</font>

892
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:40,490
entry in the registry you know i mean

893
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:42,740
this is this as your document as long as

894
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:45,470
you put it up somewhere so that it's

895
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:47,450
generally available in published you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

896
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:49,459
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> make an entry into the extension</font>

897
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:51,350
registry at I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna and get it published</font>

898
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:52,790
that way if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of extra</font>

899
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:55,279
information or it's something that works

900
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:57,350
for you so you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply making it</font>

901
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,880
visible to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all other registrar's that</font>

902
00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:00,920
you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that you expect</font>

903
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,070
it when they work with you but it's not

904
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:06,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">really a standard not an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet wide</font>

905
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:09,050
standard since some it doesn't seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

906
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:10,390
be applicable to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a broad community even</font>

907
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:12,620
though there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of others so</font>

908
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:14,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll let you think about that per minute</font>

909
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:16,580
Roger if you want to make a comment here

910
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,339
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask for the sense of the</font>

room on what people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

optional thing that you can add to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add</font>

know you from CN Nick Ford CN want to

drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to be required as your own</font>

924
00:45:52,190 --> 00:46:01,490
registry policy but it's not otherwise

925
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:03,350
broadly a requirement I rich murdering

926
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:05,540
her from godaddy again and one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

927
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:07,970
concerns that I have in I realize this

928
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:11,240
isn't a policy discussion is that the

929
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:12,830
reseller is an agent of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Registrar in</font>

930
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,419
the contracts that the Registrar has

931
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:16,670
with the registry the registrar is

932
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:19,100
completely responsible for all the

933
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:22,730
activities and actions undertaken by the

934
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:24,830
reseller and mentioning the reseller may

935
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:27,620
be an optional component as buck her

936
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:29,440
policy at least through I can as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

937
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,790
associating with the domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font>

938
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,190
creating a full object and actually

939
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:37,100
giving them an emplacement within the

940
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:39,710
system at the object level with the

941
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:42,380
possibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> of full robust entity there</font>

942
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:42,680
starts escalating their role and once

943
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,630
again

944
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,430
and the registrar is the one that is

945
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:49,100
contracted to do this work and there's

946
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:52,310
simply an agent of ours as a registrar

947
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:54,680
I'm definitely not in favor of doing

948
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:57,529
anything more than what is required by

949
00:46:54,680 --> 00:47:01,129
policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and supporting that lest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we ex</font>

of technology or at least leading to it

00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:10,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">and before you go away I just want to</font>

00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:06,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the room is that at least the path</font>

969
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:08,660
forward is this would not go on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

970
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:10,430
standards track for publication there

971
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:12,200
seems to be some disagreement about that

972
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:14,359
and what could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in it but I have no</font>

00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:21,620
advice about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this could look like</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you know best practices that kind of</font>

977
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:28,130
thing and then your<font color="#CCCCCC"> path publication is</font>

978
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:31,460
just to uh you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it on to the</font>

00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:34,250
iono registry of extensions but not try

00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:38,720
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it an internet standard and but</font>

981
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:41,630
if we want to have a reseller<font color="#CCCCCC"> extension</font>

982
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:45,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">ER tedious and though what about just to</font>

983
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:49,520
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ide and the name in their appt</font>

984
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:53,990
extension and just the result objector

985
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:55,520
optional twice right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

986
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:56,580
there's any issue with you proposing

987
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,030
what you would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

988
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:04,560
see in an epp extension arm and and what

989
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:07,920
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in an epp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh transaction mom</font>

990
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:10,560
but um since it is just entirely

991
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,090
optional I think it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

992
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,590
something that you would want and you

00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:16,170
get to define the way that you want it

994
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:18,570
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be and then you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make an entry for</font>

995
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:20,130
it we wouldn't go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to the standards</font>

996
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:22,700
track since it's not going to be broadly

997
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:25,260
implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it a reseller</font>

998
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:30,299
extension just the idea the name is

999
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:33,570
there it's a requirement but and the

1000
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:36,870
object reseller of the commanding is now

1001
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:39,780
the required one and the anyone who can

1002
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:43,470
who is optionally implemented Rosella

1003
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:47,400
and they can implement the reseller

1004
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:49,890
equation<font color="#CCCCCC"> epp and do not have the</font>

1005
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:54,930
complexities you have to implement all

1006
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:56,370
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> result um okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I just want to make</font>

1007
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:58,230
sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks in the room believe that</font>

1008
00:49:56,370 --> 00:50:00,120
I'm representing what other folks heard

1009
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:02,280
in the room is consensus here so if

1010
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,950
anyone wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to jump up and head to what</font>

1011
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,270
I'm saying or correct me that's fine um

1012
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:07,859
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going down the path of</font>

1013
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:09,750
there's a piece of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you still</font>

1014
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:13,020
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put on the standards track and</font>

1015
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:16,770
you're trying to minimize<font color="#E5E5E5"> Watson EPB</font>

1016
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:20,550
reseller extension and if you PR the

1017
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:25,640
reseller making object the doctor we can

1018
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:29,430
make it as experimental or just<font color="#CCCCCC"> Anna ID</font>

1019
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:33,029
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay any reaction to that from</font>

1020
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:36,750
folks in the room and there are two

1021
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:40,380
drops and the one drops is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> epp</font>

1022
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:45,120
reseller extension just to add a ID and

1023
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:47,550
the or a name in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> object extension we</font>

1024
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:50,569
want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as a generous track and</font>

1025
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:54,900
the other wonder if rossella mapping

1026
00:50:50,570 --> 00:51:00,290
object<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be as your suggestion and ina</font>

1027
00:50:54,900 --> 00:51:00,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">ID document</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all somewhat experimental</font>

1028
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:06,120
right so there's the reseller draft and

1029
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:08,310
the reseller dash extension draft and so

1030
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:10,230
all right so what you're asking now is

1031
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:12,750
the reseller gas extension drab

1032
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:14,730
you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> still like to see that go on to</font>

1033
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:16,740
the standard track but the reseller

1034
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:18,510
draft could be one that we would review

1035
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:20,250
here and provide some input and

1036
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:22,170
expertise and guidance about what's

1037
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:23,850
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

1038
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:27,480
you would publish separately just<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

1039
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:29,130
registry of extensions ok so if I've now

1040
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,140
clearly stated<font color="#CCCCCC"> that any reaction from</font>

1041
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:33,140
the from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room about that I don't see</font>

1042
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:35,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone jumping up up Jim please</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go ahead</font>

1043
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:38,009
yeah it sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that's the only path</font>

1044
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:39,210
forward at this point but i just want to

1045
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:42,890
point out to the group that we're

1046
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:45,480
missing an opportunity here<font color="#E5E5E5"> honestly by</font>

1047
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:47,190
providing just a tag on the domain names

1048
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:51,060
for the sole purpose of displaying it in

1049
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:53,760
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> death is again is a anti</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> project</font>

1050
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:56,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">pattern that we should not follow so but</font>

1051
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,310
that sounds like the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> path forward</font>

1052
00:51:56,130 --> 00:52:02,880
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point for this draft so I'm</font>

1053
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:04,890
sorry just for clarity here Jim are you

1054
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that yes you support this path</font>

1055
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:09,060
forward or you also don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1056
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:11,609
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the extension as a</font>

1057
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:13,259
standard i believe the reality is that's

1058
00:52:11,609 --> 00:52:15,540
the only path forward as far as whether

1059
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:17,190
or not i support it i would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1060
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:21,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">likelihood of implementation is very low</font>

1061
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:23,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok all right thank you name comb scenic</font>

1062
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:27,890
uh in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that the</font>

1063
00:52:23,609 --> 00:52:32,279
requirement<font color="#CCCCCC"> of reseller is clear so the</font>

1064
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:37,500
the conflict is that should we makes a

1065
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:42,150
minimal solution or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the maximum solution</font>

1066
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:45,300
so in my opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> I support that we move</font>

1067
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:48,540
forward the reseller extension first and

1068
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:51,060
we can keep on discussing on the

1069
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:54,480
reseller of deck in the mailing list<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1070
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:57,630
if possible maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can publish it eat</font>

1071
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:01,830
it as a experimental or informational

1072
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:04,590
RFC of the reseller object or just stop

1073
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:06,869
it it depends on them for their

1074
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:09,540
discussion of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> milanese but I support</font>

1075
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:12,630
that we should move over the extension

1076
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:19,050
of the reseller to meet the requirement

1077
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:21,240
of the reseller<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok ok thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you all</font>

1078
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:22,319

1081
00:53:34,279 --> 00:53:39,329
think what I'd rather do in the interest

1082
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:40,739
of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I guess you're looking</font>

sense of the room on that or you wanna

1089
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:57,449
can you take that discussion to the

1092
00:54:00,809 --> 00:54:06,150
homage<font color="#CCCCCC"> are our folks in the room</font>

1093
00:54:03,329 --> 00:54:07,769
prepared to hum on that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

1094
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:09,390
quick show of hands do you have an

1095
00:54:07,769 --> 00:54:12,269
opinion about a 2d you'd be willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1096
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:16,739
UM for me I don't see any<font color="#E5E5E5"> ends coming up</font>

1097
00:54:12,269 --> 00:54:19,890
but I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if people are</font>

1098
00:54:16,739 --> 00:54:23,609
will hum or not if we do the a 2d and

1099
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:26,699
I'm not seeing any hands up you got one

1100
00:54:23,609 --> 00:54:28,319
comment a yes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> rich murdering her</font>

1101
00:54:26,699 --> 00:54:30,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">godaddy there was a recommendation to</font>

1102
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:32,549
add a fifth option so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font>

1103
00:54:30,299 --> 00:54:34,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">humming on one through four should be</font>

1104
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:37,319
done without including that fifth option

1105
00:54:34,589 --> 00:54:41,940
thank you fair enough that's a good

1106
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:43,229
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and um Alyssa please Alyssa</font>

1107
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:46,920
Cooper so these are options in the

1108
00:54:43,229 --> 00:54:48,709
reseller draft correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and so when</font>

1109
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,910
the conclusion you just came to is that

1110
00:54:48,709 --> 00:54:53,219
gonna think about whether to progress

1111
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:54,959
that draft or not or how to do it so if

1112
00:54:53,219 --> 00:54:56,910
what you're looking for is like feedback

1113
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:59,038
about what people which<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of those</font>

1114
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:01,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">options people think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the best then I</font>

1115
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:02,670
would suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> a show of hands generally</font>

1116
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:04,229
trying to get consensus right you're

1117
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:06,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">just looking for feedback about which</font>

1118
00:55:04,229 --> 00:55:08,038
one people is most interested in so that

1119
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:09,029
would just just that people aren't

1120
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:11,099
confused you're not trying to get

1121
00:55:09,029 --> 00:55:13,319
consensus which is you don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1122
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:16,019
to measure the hum volume so I'd

1123
00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:18,390
recommend a show of hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you</font>

1124
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:20,698
that's a good suggestion and maybe we'll

1125
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:23,339
lot need our<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jabbar scribe to watch in</font>

1126
00:55:20,699 --> 00:55:25,049
the jabber room for shows of hands on

1127
00:55:23,339 --> 00:55:28,529
the different options so the were there

1128
00:55:25,049 --> 00:55:32,549
were five options there ok let's try and

1129
00:55:28,529 --> 00:55:35,540
go through these quickly um let me go

1130
00:55:32,549 --> 00:55:49,910
back to or sly

1131
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:52,430
kids and go back to the options so we

1132
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:54,560
have four options and option a was the

1133
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:56,149
ID and<font color="#CCCCCC"> name only option i'm assuming</font>

1134
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,220
folks of you know have looked at the

1135
00:55:56,150 --> 00:56:00,710
slides and so you know what the the

1136
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:03,259
fifth option which was mentioned was um

1137
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:05,240
just just having the name with the

1138
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:07,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">domain creek which is actually already</font>

1139
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,290
there and using that as just the option

1140
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:13,070
that should go forward in this document

1141
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:14,540
is everyone clear about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all</font>

1142
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:18,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just do a quick show of</font>

1143
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:21,170
hands here on option a anyone those in

1144
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:24,190
favor of option a here I don't see any

1145
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:27,110
hands and eat any jabber indications

1146
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:29,240
indicated in<font color="#E5E5E5"> jabber you can say ABCD or</font>

1147
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:30,890
use e for the last option if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

1148
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:33,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">get your vote in now make it a little</font>

1149
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:38,629
easier for the jabber scribe to indicate

1150
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:41,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay option B any hands-on option B no</font>

1151
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:42,590
hands in the room not seeing any

1152
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:46,160
indication<font color="#E5E5E5"> of anything in the jabber</font>

1153
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:48,110
option<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a new reseller object we got</font>

1154
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:54,859
one hand in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room two hands in the</font>

1155
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:57,500
room 33 hands in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's</font>

1156
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:59,330
some support there for that option<font color="#CCCCCC"> D an</font>

1157
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:03,170
object with different roles of reseller

1158
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:06,910
and registrar not seeing any hands in

1159
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:06,910
the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh one hand in the room okay</font>

1160
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:13,190
and two hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> in jabber okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

1161
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:15,710
we got a close call there between C and

1162
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:18,680
D and then the last one is the option e

1163
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:23,660
which was raised on the floor and we

1164
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:26,600
have two hands in the room okay and

1165
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:28,009
nothing in the jabber so it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

1166
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,680
of the interest is in the last three

1167
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:32,890
options and I guess option C is one

1168
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:35,120
which has four verses 3 not you know

1169
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:39,259
numbers aren't really all that distant

1170
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:40,670
but um maybe we can put press a little

1171
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,870
bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mailing list and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see if</font>

1172
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:44,690
you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some more discussion as to</font>

1173
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:45,980
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> people want one option versus</font>

1174
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:47,510
another and that will be helpful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1175
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:49,349
to choose what you want in this

1176
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:50,489
particular case<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really is your</font>

1177
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:52,289
choice as to where you want to go with

00:57:50,489 --> 00:57:54,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">it as long as it's not going to go on</font>

1179
00:57:52,289 --> 00:57:56,279
the standards track it's entirely up to

1180
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:59,039
you what you know how you want to

1181
00:57:56,279 --> 00:58:01,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">evaluate what you've heard here in the</font>

1182
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:03,359
hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put in the document and then</font>

1183
00:58:01,109 --> 00:58:08,130
seek to put that<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the registry the</font>

1184
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:17,848
iono registry<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right thank you</font>

1185
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:19,619
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much so next document is the EPP</font>

1186
00:58:17,849 --> 00:58:21,720
fees document<font color="#CCCCCC"> um this document has</font>

1187
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:25,650
actually kind of been in a pause for a

1188
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:27,629
while we have tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reach out to</font>

1189
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:30,660
Gavin the principal author a couple of

1190
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:33,989
times<font color="#CCCCCC"> here to move this forward I don't</font>

1191
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:36,779
know that Gavin's in the jabber room or

1192
00:58:33,989 --> 00:58:39,180
not but I have not actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> reached out</font>

1193
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:41,999
to him formally on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point yet but I</font>

1194
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:44,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">think what we're going to try to do here</font>

1195
00:58:41,999 --> 00:58:46,319
as the chairs has reach out to Gavin and

1196
00:58:44,759 --> 00:58:48,809
see if we can seek to get another

1197
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:51,299
document editor on this document so that

1198
00:58:48,809 --> 00:58:53,729
we can move<font color="#E5E5E5"> it forward there's an option</font>

1199
00:58:51,299 --> 00:58:55,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">see that was selected by the working</font>

1200
00:58:53,729 --> 00:58:57,210
group in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the three options that he had</font>

1201
00:58:55,259 --> 00:58:58,859
their that we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get folded</font>

1202
00:58:57,210 --> 00:59:01,380
into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> document and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then push that</font>

1203
00:58:58,859 --> 00:59:03,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">back out so that we can review it make</font>

1204
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:05,609
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> we still have consensus and then it</font>

1205
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:07,200
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> move forward and there is some</font>

1206
00:59:05,609 --> 00:59:12,380
interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> in moving this document forward</font>

1207
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:16,859
so I do believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know who to</font>

1208
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:18,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">volunteer for being the new editor folks</font>

1209
00:59:16,859 --> 00:59:19,859
have already agreed and said that they

1210
00:59:18,299 --> 00:59:22,920
would do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I just need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font>

1211
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:24,719
Gavin and see if we can tie that up and

1212
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:27,869
then we can move this document forward

1213
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:29,249
and hopefully see some progress here by

1214
00:59:27,869 --> 00:59:36,989
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next time we're sitting in a room</font>

1215
00:59:29,249 --> 00:59:38,218
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this okay so if we don't have any</font>

1216
00:59:36,989 --> 00:59:40,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">other comments there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll go to the</font>

1217
00:59:38,219 --> 00:59:41,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">second part which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is next set of</font>

1218
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:43,200
documents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have now these are</font>

1219
00:59:41,789 --> 00:59:45,960
documents which are working group

1220
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:48,269
documents they have been in our in our

1221
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:51,239
charter they're kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the next up and</font>

1222
00:59:48,269 --> 00:59:53,968
we really haven't had<font color="#E5E5E5"> any discussion yet</font>

1223
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:56,369
on our mailing list about them so

1224
00:59:53,969 --> 00:59:59,130
they're not active yet in the working

1225
00:59:56,369 --> 01:00:01,349
group but you know I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call them</font>

1226
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:02,340
out here and just quickly asked as

1227
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:04,500
anyone

1228
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:06,120
a start a discussion here in any one of

1229
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:08,700
these documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there a preference on</font>

1230
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:11,279
which one to pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> two to press on on the</font>

1231
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:14,399
mailing list and move forward with and

1232
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,200
you won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any reactions in favor or</font>

1233
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,060
against about any one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font>

1234
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,649
otherwise we really just look on the

1235
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:22,790
mailing list to try to move them along

1236
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:25,770
and move forward so<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh please go ahead</font>

1237
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:29,550
is the gym<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool to verisign since i'm</font>

1238
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:31,170
the author on these four documents that

1239
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:34,520
the one that I would particularly like

1240
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:38,700
to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> verification code</font>

1241
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:40,920
followed by the change pole on the env

1242
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:44,129
mapping is an informational draft that

1243
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:46,680
demonstrates a concrete implementation

1244
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:49,230
of a vsp that supports the verification

1245
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:53,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">code extension and then the last one is</font>

1246
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:56,010
the allocation token extension and both

1247
01:00:53,550 --> 01:01:00,090
the allocation token in the change<font color="#E5E5E5"> pole</font>

1248
01:00:56,010 --> 01:01:01,770
or co-authored with new star so maybe

1249
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:05,550
they may be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to those</font>

1250
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:07,440
extensions as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and just so I</font>

1251
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:09,390
understand I think I heard you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1252
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:13,200
the change pole you wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just be an</font>

1253
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:16,200
informational no no no the name value

1254
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:19,020
mapping the the env mapping is an

1255
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:22,259
informational document the change<font color="#E5E5E5"> pole i</font>

1256
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:24,090
would want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be standards track and as</font>

1257
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:26,340
far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as implementation goes i'll just let</font>

1258
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:29,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know that we are leveraging change</font>

1259
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:31,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">pole more and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more now and I would</font>

1260
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">encourage registries to start looking at</font>

1261
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:36,450
that extension so therefore you can

1262
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:39,330
notify your registrar's of changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1263
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:41,460
you're making on your end but we're

1264
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:44,549
finding that it's useful when it comes

1265
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:49,620
to things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like applying the verification</font>

1266
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:51,480
code<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy so okay so the env mapping</font>

1267
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:53,430
you you would want it published as it as

1268
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,770
an arc see but informational not on the

1269
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:58,770
standards track then you'll use that as

1270
01:01:55,770 --> 01:02:02,670
the probably still register it in the I

1271
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:07,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">Anna registering uh yes yes okay all</font>

1272
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:11,539
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you next</font>

1273
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:14,930
hello this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is news to louver I have read</font>

1274
01:02:11,539 --> 01:02:17,720
the verification code<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft and I think</font>

1275
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:19,669
there are significant parts missing

1276
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:23,149
especially where it comes to privacy

1277
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:24,589
considerations and where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to the</font>

1278
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:27,049
verification service provider and its

1279
01:02:24,589 --> 01:02:29,299
implications I think this is an

1280
01:02:27,049 --> 01:02:32,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">implementation of the arse app that has</font>

1281
01:02:29,299 --> 01:02:35,150
been filed by verisign within I can I

1282
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:37,970
think there are potential quite some

1283
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:41,329
consequences to this work which have not

1284
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:42,828
been documented at all so<font color="#E5E5E5"> before this</font>

1285
01:02:41,329 --> 01:02:46,220
could move<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward I would really</font>

1286
01:02:42,829 --> 01:02:50,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">appreciate if the author would document</font>

1287
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:52,189
the implication<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and potentially</font>

1288
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:55,038
what I think would be an interesting

1289
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:59,450
thing is like to look at the privacy

1290
01:02:55,039 --> 01:03:02,960
guidelines as they are in the end I a

1291

you please post your concerns on the

1297
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:23,660
list because I'm unaware of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

1298
01:03:22,279 --> 01:03:25,789
particular concerns and hopefully I'll

1299
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:27,529
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> but respond to him because honestly</font>

1300
01:03:25,789 --> 01:03:30,650
the verification code extension is very

1301
01:03:27,529 --> 01:03:33,499
straightforward it doesn't have any PII

1302
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:36,109
data so she with it so I'd really like

1303
01:03:33,499 --> 01:03:37,700
to know specifically what you mean right

1304
01:03:36,109 --> 01:03:39,410
so thank you for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jim you you beat</font>

1305
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:41,808
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it I was writing notes and looking</font>

1306
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:43,640
down but yeah I was going to say that

1307
01:03:41,809 --> 01:03:45,440
please do bring your comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,700
discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> going and move this along but</font>

1310
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:52,309
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to respond go ahead yeah so</font>

1311
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:55,578
building<font color="#E5E5E5"> the infrastructure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forever for</font>

1312
01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:57,499
verification service providers might set

1313
01:03:55,579 --> 01:04:01,069
up stronger obligations for people for

1314
01:03:57,499 --> 01:04:04,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">end users</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to to obligated verification</font>

1315
01:04:01,069 --> 01:04:05,989
of the of their identity which might

1316
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:10,420
have serious implication for their

1317
01:04:05,989 --> 01:04:13,130
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to to register domain names</font>

1318
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:15,200
so building the infrastructure for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1319
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:16,970
doesn't directly work with pii but it

1320
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,859
simply shoves down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the responsibility</font>

1321
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:20,480
and built an extra bottle neck and

1322
01:04:18,859 --> 01:04:23,330
you're saying well I not<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

1323
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:25,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">bii so it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my problem is I think a</font>

1324
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:28,279
bit short-sighted because it adds

1325
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:29,779
another point of control in the whole

1326
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:33,800
line so I think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should seriously</font>

1327
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:36,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">consider this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1328
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:39,080
again please<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to provide that kind of</font>

1329
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:40,730
detail to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list yes Jim goal</font>

1330
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:42,650
from veras on again so you're really

1331
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:45,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about architecture here and not</font>

1332
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:48,230
the contents of the draft itself so yeah

1333
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:49,669
if you could post it on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list and we</font>

1334
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:52,340
can talk offline as well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1335
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:55,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">would be worthwhile on this but just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1336
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:58,609
note this particular extension tries to

1337
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:01,009
ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the data stays private and</font>

1338
01:04:58,609 --> 01:05:02,859
in the particular country and creating

1339
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:05,930
the infrastructure support that is up to

1340
01:05:02,859 --> 01:05:09,859
the particular locality and it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1341
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:12,470
apply those verifications but the code

1342
01:05:09,859 --> 01:05:14,270
itself is a mechanism by which we can

1343
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:18,859
ensure the data stays where it needs to

1344
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:20,240
stay<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay one last comment and then I do</font>

1345
01:05:18,859 --> 01:05:22,009
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move along from this because I'm</font>

1346
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:25,779
realizing that we're actually just a few

1347
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:27,980
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind schedule here yes so a</font>

1348
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:31,700
happy to take this offline<font color="#E5E5E5"> up but also</font>

1349
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:34,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">on list I'd say the data stay way it</font>

1350
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:37,700
needs to stay I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if the data</font>

1351
01:05:34,609 --> 01:05:40,640
verify whether the concept of having

1352
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:43,430
verified service providers and verified

1353
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:45,350
names is a concept that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy</font>

1354
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:47,299
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're saying that that is the</font>

1355
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:48,830
place where<font color="#CCCCCC"> it should be is I think a</font>

1356
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:50,630
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a normative statement that I</font>

1357
01:05:48,830 --> 01:05:57,410
think we could and should debate and

1358
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:59,390
consider okay thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay uh next</font>

1359
01:05:57,410 --> 01:06:03,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of the agenda is an open discussion</font>

1360
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:06,319
about ways in which this working group

1361
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:08,119
could reconsider how it works and I

1362
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:11,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">think this is a good opportunity to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

1363
01:06:08,119 --> 01:06:14,750
if Antoine can step into the queue here

1364
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:20,150
and pick up this discussion and and do

1365
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:23,710
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not seeing you coming into the</font>

1366
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:23,710
queue but I'm hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're there</font>

1367
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:31,430
you're putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> me on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spot right yes</font>

1368
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:32,900
ah there we go well can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you it is kind</font>

1369
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:34,230
of soft can you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you speak a little</font>

1370
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:38,280
louder a little closer to

1371
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:40,080
Mike<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait is better that helps a little</font>

1372
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:42,780
bit but it actually it is kind of quiet

1373
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:45,319
in this room unfortunately but<font color="#CCCCCC"> um just</font>

1374
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:49,140
yes they close to I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could never go ahead</font>

1375
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:53,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">I have the live issue work slide up on</font>

1376
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:56,520
the screen<font color="#CCCCCC"> so yes well I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most most</font>

1377
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:59,850
of the people have i've read<font color="#CCCCCC"> this it</font>

1378
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:03,660
wasn't suggestion good working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1379
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:07,170
chairs from the from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IDF chair and</font>

1380
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:09,779
think about how we could save some time

1381
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:13,859
or do some some some things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1382
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:16,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">different from just only reveal our</font>

1383
01:07:13,859 --> 01:07:18,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">drafts and having questions and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1384
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:23,040
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this and i thought well</font>

1385
01:07:18,810 --> 01:07:25,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know often we discuss documents and</font>

1386
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:30,650
there are questions at the end of

1387
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:33,270
presentations that may be resolved

1388
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:35,760
immediately during the meeting if he

1389
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:41,970
just had some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more time and lots of</font>

1390
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:43,680
versions of continuing the agenda some

1391
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:46,790
of the things i thought of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1392
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:49,740
sometimes questions are asked where the

1393
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:56,300
presenter just needs to look something

1394
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:56,299
up of us<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptop about certain values or</font>

1395
01:07:56,690 --> 01:08:03,540
sometimes there is text suggested but it

1396
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:05,490
cannot immediately be written down and

1397
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:07,859
and these are the things that are

1398
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:11,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking of is there something that we</font>

1399
01:08:07,859 --> 01:08:15,960
could do to just have some time on in

1400
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:19,140
our in our meeting to do some live

1401
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:21,600
document editing or some Sun Life Robin

1402
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:23,910
resolving likes for example the the

1403
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:26,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">question you just had from London about</font>

1404
01:08:23,910 --> 01:08:28,738
choosing option A to G it is that

1405
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:31,920
something that we could discuss during

1406
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:34,108
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know shutting the meeting down for</font>

1407
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:36,000
like five minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everybody's</font>

1408
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:38,910
discussing among themselves which

1409
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,890
options that they would prefer those

1410
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:45,059
were the things I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was thinking oh so I I</font>

1411
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:47,589
realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that shutting the the the</font>

agenda of 45 minutes

01:08:47,589 --> 01:08:52,509
will mean that people that follow the

1414
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:55,889
meeting remote like I'm gonna now will

1415
01:08:52,509 --> 01:08:58,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">not be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to join the discussion or</font>

1416
01:08:55,889 --> 01:09:02,830
that these different branches look

1417
01:08:58,149 --> 01:09:08,290
recorded when I'm not for you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow</font>

1418
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:11,380
but but maybe it can lead to some some

1419
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:14,080
faster for census<font color="#E5E5E5"> billion so I want to</font>

1420
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:16,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a sense of the room or are there any</font>

1421
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:22,389
other suggestions where they have like

1422
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:28,380
that so thank you um we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment</font>

1423
01:09:22,389 --> 01:09:32,020
here in the room um Alex may I offer um

1424
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:34,509
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience is that you can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solve</font>

1425
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:36,219
any issue in five minutes even if it's

1426
01:09:34,509 --> 01:09:37,270
very small one because five minutes are

1427
01:09:36,219 --> 01:09:39,698
<font color="#CCCCCC">not different enough that all people</font>

1428
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:42,909
interested in voice their opinion what

1429
01:09:39,698 --> 01:09:45,399
does work however is trying to get like

1430
01:09:42,908 --> 01:09:47,108
three to five people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are</font>

1431
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:50,649
specifically interested in a certain

1432
01:09:47,109 --> 01:09:54,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">topic together around the table during</font>

1433
01:09:50,649 --> 01:09:57,159
the meeting week yeah discuss for about

1434
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:59,199
an hour it's amazing how much work you

1435
01:09:57,159 --> 01:10:00,820
can done in an hour if the three to four

1436
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:03,879
experts on a certain topic is sitting

1437
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:06,429
together and then have that design team

1438
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:08,949
sort of around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft come back to</font>

1439
01:10:06,429 --> 01:10:11,110
the group and let them report in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

1440
01:10:08,949 --> 01:10:13,119
minute slide what they came up during

1441
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:15,549
that discussion and then let the working

1442
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:18,130
group decide whether that was that is

1443
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:20,349
some the way they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go yeah so</font>

1444
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:22,420
sort of like the combination of design

1445
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:25,090
team meeting if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to call it that</font>

1446
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:27,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">way during the meeting week and</font>

1447
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:29,409
reporting back at at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual working</font>

1448
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:31,570
group session if the working group

1449
01:10:29,409 --> 01:10:33,280
session is late enough in the meeting

1450
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:36,519
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the case this time but might</font>

1451
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:38,830
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in future so the observation I</font>

1452
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:41,349
make that ain't one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've talked back</font>

1453
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:43,599
here is we like that suggestion a lot

1454
01:10:41,349 --> 01:10:45,580
three to five<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in a room but it</font>

1455
01:10:43,599 --> 01:10:47,679
turns out that for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most part for</font>

1456
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:49,239
this working group it's just three to

1457
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:51,909
five people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are interested in a</font>

1458
01:10:49,239 --> 01:10:54,519
document so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially</font>

1459
01:10:51,909 --> 01:10:57,549
the design team in this room you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I</font>

1460
01:10:54,520 --> 01:11:00,040
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a as a simple statement here to</font>

1461
01:10:57,550 --> 01:11:01,210
sort of summarize what Antoine had said

1462
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:02,830
before

1463
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:05,550
we could use these working group

1464
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:08,710
meetings as more of a working session

1465
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:10,330
and perhaps be able to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> along some</font>

1466
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:13,180
of these smaller documents a little bit

1467
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:14,500
quicker and really come to closure you

1468
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:16,719
know I realize there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than three</font>

1469
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:18,610
to five people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but for any</font>

1470
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:21,280
given document there's generally only

1471
01:11:18,610 --> 01:11:22,900
three to five people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we might use</font>

1472
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:25,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">the mailing list to pick a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1473
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:27,160
documents and set some time aside and

1474
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:28,870
you know while we're here in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room</font>

1475
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:30,790
those three to five people would focus

1476
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:33,460
on discussing that document in front of

1477
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:35,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone and move it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forward so we have</font>

1478
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:38,920
our ad once the talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alyssa go ahead</font>

1479
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:40,930
Alyssa Cooper um so I just wanted to

1480
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:44,469
note that there's potentially a lot of

1481
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:46,239
flexibility here so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> possibly do</font>

1482
01:11:44,469 --> 01:11:47,500
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that both of you are talking</font>

1483
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:50,379
about which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know you could</font>

1484
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:52,270
schedule an hour which is a an editing

1485
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:53,830
session and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can later schedule</font>

1486
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:55,210
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> half an hour you know you can request</font>

1487
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:57,610
two slots or you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> request to our</font>

1488
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:58,960
long slots or something like this this

1489
01:11:57,610 --> 01:12:01,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">is actually something that other working</font>

1490
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,860
groups sort of already do except that

1491
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:04,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">they request two slots on the</font>

1492
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:05,950
understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

1493
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:09,280
designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> teamwork happening in between</font>

1494
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:11,530
them but part of this experimentation

1495
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:13,090
that we're encouraging is to say request

1496
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:15,940
a slot even if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're if it's not going</font>

1497
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:17,530
to be just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for presentations so that's</font>

1498
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:19,210
definitely an option the other thing

1499
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:21,370
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially possible with this</font>

1500
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:24,310
working group if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is approximately</font>

1501
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:27,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">the size that it usually is is that you</font>

1502
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:29,290
could request a u-shape in the room if

1503
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,120
you thought that would foster

1504
01:12:29,290 --> 01:12:33,790
conversation better for either kind of

1505
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:36,309
session so just something to think about

1506
01:12:33,790 --> 01:12:40,450
that were promoting for smaller working

1507
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:42,489
groups excellent thank you um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually</font>

1508
01:12:40,450 --> 01:12:50,410
was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware that we could request a</font>

1509
01:12:42,489 --> 01:12:52,269
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup in the room oh ok ok so</font>

1510
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:54,040
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the microphone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lissajous</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font>

1511
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:55,630
there's no promise on getting a u-shape

1512
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:57,190
but they are looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for people to</font>

1513
01:12:55,630 --> 01:12:58,090
suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they might want that and</font>

1514
01:12:57,190 --> 01:12:59,650
then they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see if they can</font>

1515
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:02,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">deliver it so that that could be</font>

1516
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:05,769
interesting Alex please<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alex</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mayerhofer</font>

1517
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:07,509
arm if we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything session during the</font>

1518
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:09,250
meeting I suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we split it up in</font>

1519
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:12,670
smaller groups I mean we are just like

1520
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:14,469
30 people maybe but still it seems to me

1521
01:13:12,670 --> 01:13:15,160
a waste of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with like three people I</font>

1522
01:13:14,469 --> 01:13:17,740
actually discussed

1523
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:19,780
in one single draught and editing by 27

1524
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:21,820
others are reading your email so i

1525
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:24,639
suggest we like we might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1526
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:26,590
split up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room in four quarters here</font>

1527
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:28,420
and then we can work on for smaller

1528
01:13:26,590 --> 01:13:30,010
drafts at the same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe for half</font>

1529
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:32,380
an hour or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

1530
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:34,720
we can reconcile and report back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1531
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:38,350
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> group what we came up with maybe</font>

1532
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:39,910
that's an efficient way focus yeah so

1533
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:43,000
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting is the Antoine</font>

1534
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:45,700
nodding to I like the idea of but

1535
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,950
perhaps requesting to meeting slots you

1536
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:49,690
know some short ones a short one hour

1537
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:51,519
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then a short working group one</font>

1538
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:54,190
hour so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have an editing meeting</font>

1539
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:56,470
for an hour and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> a separate our for</font>

1540
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:58,809
you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole working group and</font>

1541
01:13:56,470 --> 01:14:01,660
then as you're saying Alex um yeah for

1542
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:03,460
the editing session divider self up into

1543
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:04,660
groups if that's possible and have

1544
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:07,600
different people sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the room</font>

1545
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:10,150
doing different documents so it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1546
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:14,140
something to experiment with ahead Jody

1547
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:18,040
um at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the risk of being thrown out of</font>

1548
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:19,300
this meeting yeah you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want</font>

1549
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:21,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">to bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up something seems like you</font>

1550
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:23,970
know the mailing list happens and things

1551
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:27,190
do happen along there but is there any

1552
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:28,930
interest in you know having just a

1553
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:30,730
working group meeting with three or four

1554
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:33,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are interested in a document</font>

1555
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:35,500
you know getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> together over a phone</font>

1556
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:37,270
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know between the meetings you</font>

1557
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:38,560
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the four months between the</font>

1558
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:40,480
meetings and start editing and

1559
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,460
exchanging ideas that kind of thing I

1560
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:44,230
mean if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run a documentary</font>

1561
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:46,240
you're trying to get it<font color="#CCCCCC"> through you know</font>

1562
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:48,339
get the interested parties or whoever

1563
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:50,290
may be interested on it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know set up</font>

1564
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:51,790
a weekly meeting or a bi-weekly meeting

1565
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:54,430
I know I know nobody needs any more

1566
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:57,130
meetings<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know if we're trying to</font>

1567
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:59,710
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> progress made maybe maybe that's an</font>

1568
01:14:57,130 --> 01:15:01,630
idea so let me take that request and

1569
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:04,300
make it into two different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1570
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:05,740
things at an ad hoc level there's no

1571
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:07,000
reason that any group of people couldn't

1572
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:08,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">get together and try and do something</font>

1573
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,480
and then bring it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the mailing</font>

1574
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:12,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">list to propose it since</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys are</font>

1575
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:14,230
relatively new i will then tell you that

1576
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:15,610
the other side<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it though is you want</font>

1577
01:15:14,230 --> 01:15:17,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have an interim meeting there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1578
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:18,969
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of formality associated</font>

1579
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:20,830
with having a real working group meeting

1580
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:22,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's an interim eating and is in any</font>

1581
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:24,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">way kind of a formal activity of the</font>

1582
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:26,860
group because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do meeting</font>

1583
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:28,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">announcements and and you know this has</font>

1584
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:29,079
to be a certain window of notice about

1585
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:31,209
them

1586
01:15:29,079 --> 01:15:32,530
but ad hoc groups could easily get

1587
01:15:31,209 --> 01:15:34,358
together if they wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1588
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:36,099
themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> as long as you're always</font>

1589
01:15:34,359 --> 01:15:37,659
careful to bring it back to the main

1590
01:15:36,099 --> 01:15:40,929
networking group mailing list to move

1591
01:15:37,659 --> 01:15:42,608
stuff along and Jim it Mike yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1592
01:15:40,929 --> 01:15:45,219
really like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea of having those</font>

1593
01:15:42,609 --> 01:15:46,389
breakout sessions before the meeting

1594
01:15:45,219 --> 01:15:47,949
hopefully other meetings aren't on

1595
01:15:46,389 --> 01:15:50,649
Friday so therefore we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a whole week</font>

1596
01:15:47,949 --> 01:15:52,959
to do that but the point is is that

1597
01:15:50,649 --> 01:15:55,300
maybe when we post up an agenda we have

1598
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:58,059
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> gen items roulette for discussions</font>

1599
01:15:55,300 --> 01:16:00,579
that then folks can discuss and

1600
01:15:58,059 --> 01:16:03,249
volunteer discuss them have breakout

1601
01:16:00,579 --> 01:16:09,389
sessions without a formal room per se

1602
01:16:03,249 --> 01:16:12,280
and then report them here when we need

1603
01:16:09,389 --> 01:16:14,349
so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest of bringing this to a</font>

1604
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:16,329
close but I will pause and let our area

1605
01:16:14,349 --> 01:16:18,789
director speakers yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ellis ticket for</font>

1606
01:16:16,329 --> 01:16:19,959
uh just uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> you shouldn't view there</font>

1607
01:16:18,789 --> 01:16:22,389
being a high barrier to a virtual

1608
01:16:19,959 --> 01:16:25,989
interim it's so it's a one week lead

1609
01:16:22,389 --> 01:16:27,629
time a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of groups</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I that I</font>

1610
01:16:25,989 --> 01:16:29,768
Shepherd in the other part of the area

1611
01:16:27,629 --> 01:16:31,929
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of have a sense of</font>

1612
01:16:29,769 --> 01:16:33,099
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> time of day is good for most of</font>

1613
01:16:31,929 --> 01:16:34,899
their participants and so they don't

1614
01:16:33,099 --> 01:16:36,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">even like pole anymore for what's a good</font>

1615
01:16:34,899 --> 01:16:39,729
time they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask about dates and then</font>

1616
01:16:36,909 --> 01:16:41,049
choose and it's also possible to set up

1617
01:16:39,729 --> 01:16:43,300
a recurring one of those so you don't

1618
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:46,570
have to constantly realize things I was

1619
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:48,369
shocking me so anyway it shouldn't it

1620
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:50,499
really should not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a high barrier if a</font>

1621
01:16:48,369 --> 01:16:53,489
virtual interim is or regular virtual

1622
01:16:50,499 --> 01:16:57,369
interim is something you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up</font>

1623
01:16:53,489 --> 01:16:59,468
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so i think i'm i'm hearing from the</font>

1624
01:16:57,369 --> 01:17:02,530
room that there there is interest and a

1625
01:16:59,469 --> 01:17:04,719
desire to have some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of working</font>

1626
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:06,849
session i'll call it and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1627
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:09,489
interest in two kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things one is</font>

1628
01:17:06,849 --> 01:17:11,559
perhaps looking to set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up in an interim</font>

1629
01:17:09,489 --> 01:17:13,030
you know one or two phone calls you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1630
01:17:11,559 --> 01:17:15,579
pick a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of documents a particular</font>

1631
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:17,199
interest if there's a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> people maybe</font>

1632
01:17:15,579 --> 01:17:19,329
we can can set up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

1633
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:20,619
teleconference going and move a document

1634
01:17:19,329 --> 01:17:23,799
along in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way and that would be a</font>

1635
01:17:20,619 --> 01:17:26,858
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm also sensing an</font>

1636
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:28,959
interest in perhaps we should seek to

1637
01:17:26,859 --> 01:17:30,909
consider doing this in Chicago<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see</font>

1638
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:32,409
where we are with documents and what

1639
01:17:30,909 --> 01:17:35,348
happens as we get into January in

1640
01:17:32,409 --> 01:17:37,568
February but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can look to set up</font>

1641
01:17:35,349 --> 01:17:39,249
to working group sessions to shorter

1642
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:40,839
meetings our group<font color="#E5E5E5"> is generally pretty</font>

1643
01:17:39,249 --> 01:17:42,940
small we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> generally need a lot of</font>

1644
01:17:40,839 --> 01:17:44,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">time but if we can get to</font>

1645
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:47,110
our time slots we can have a working

1646
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:49,090
meeting and then we can have an editing

1647
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:50,769
session for perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> some documents and</font>

1648
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:53,530
then not also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a separate working</font>

1649
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:54,910
group meeting as a follow on to that so

1650
01:17:53,530 --> 01:17:58,630
Antoine anything you want to head to

1651
01:17:54,910 --> 01:18:02,469
that summary guess what I'm also hearing

1652
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:06,190
is a third option and the third option

1653
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:12,040
is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> people want to discuss document so</font>

1654
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:13,870
long<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that they sort of like suggest</font>

1655
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:20,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they will have an everything</font>

1656
01:18:13,870 --> 01:18:22,360
session before the meeting so an ad hoc

1657
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:25,750
opportunity perhaps during the IETF week

1658
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:29,380
or or or otherwise for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that want</font>

1659
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:31,000
to discuss each document with everybody

1660
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:33,340
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is interesting perhaps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

1661
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:36,760
corridors or in the bar or wherever but

1662
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:39,040
just that they indicate when it's on the

1663
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:45,580
agenda if you want to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

1664
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:49,180
document specifically please pick a time

1665
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:54,370
or a place or we can talk about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead</font>

1666
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:56,250
of the end of the meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay sounds</font>

1667
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:59,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">good oh and Alex</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get the last word</font>

1668
01:18:56,250 --> 01:19:01,510
Alex me an offer Alton what you just

1669
01:18:59,770 --> 01:19:04,090
said actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> works quite well if the</font>

1670
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:06,550
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> author is the one organizing it</font>

1671
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:09,820
I had that very successful yesterday for

1672
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:10,989
a document I run in deep<font color="#E5E5E5"> ref and it's</font>

1673
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:13,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">really amazing how much what you can</font>

1674
01:19:10,989 --> 01:19:15,820
done but it requires you as a document

1675
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:18,160
order to really be essentially

1676
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:20,650
aggressive on collecting people around

1677
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:24,940
the table and pushing for things to

1678
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:29,820
become<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working with</font>

1679
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:29,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">Gareth can of course encourage that</font>

1680
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:37,000
that's right will encourage aggression

1681
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:39,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay bring you to buy fork alright so</font>

1682
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:42,340
thank you meant wanan and thank you

1683
01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:45,370
everyone here for that discussion very

1684
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:47,949
useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're down to the agenda</font>

1685
01:19:45,370 --> 01:19:49,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have a new work item a call for</font>

1686
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:52,928
adoption on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential new work item</font>

1687
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:55,840
here and Roger Carney is going to give

1688
01:19:52,929 --> 01:19:59,440
us a quick presentation on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft that</font>

1689
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:07,239
he has put out there and distributed and

1690
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:08,830
get those slides I think anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

1691
01:20:07,239 --> 01:20:11,619
in Berlin probably saw this because I

1692
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:13,599
think Jody introduced this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Berlin and</font>

1693
01:20:11,619 --> 01:20:17,019
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I may have mentioned it</font>

1694
01:20:13,599 --> 01:20:20,980
to several<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess before that</font>

1695
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:22,929
wherever we were but we're looking at it

1696
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:26,650
from a registrar's perspective is a

1697
01:20:22,929 --> 01:20:28,090
validate command and it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed</font>

1698
01:20:26,650 --> 01:20:31,210
quite a bit since Jody introduced this

1699
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:33,070
in Berlin we've met<font color="#E5E5E5"> with several</font>

1700
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:35,050
registries and came to a better

1701
01:20:33,070 --> 01:20:36,570
conclusion on how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get this</font>

1702
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:40,270
implemented so we moved it from a

1703
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:43,360
standard extension into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the</font>

1704
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:45,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">Czech command but you know technically</font>

1705
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:50,110
that's all we did the function<font color="#CCCCCC"> is still</font>

1706
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:52,419
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> the goal here is to not just</font>

1707
01:20:50,110 --> 01:20:54,580
create generic contacts which the

1708
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:58,810
registry is going to allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do but</font>

1709
01:20:54,580 --> 01:21:00,699
validate those contacts what usually

1710
01:20:58,810 --> 01:21:05,020
happens at the domain create or update

1711
01:21:00,699 --> 01:21:07,928
time when someone says that either an

1712
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:10,690
admin or a registrant has to have a

1713
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:12,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">specific address you can create those</font>

1714
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:14,080
contacts and the registries not going to

1715
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:17,980
care until you actually associate<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1716
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:20,139
to the domain so when you that happens

1717
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:21,900
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an error and you're down the</font>

1718
01:21:20,139 --> 01:21:24,670
purchase path from a registrar

1719
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:28,570
perspective and now you have to try to

1720
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:31,719
get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Registrar to actually correct or</font>

1721
01:21:28,570 --> 01:21:34,690
redo things that you've already<font color="#E5E5E5"> accepted</font>

1722
01:21:31,719 --> 01:21:38,639
from them so this the big goal here is

1723
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:41,650
to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a contact validation done</font>

1724
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:43,989
prior to actually creating the<font color="#CCCCCC"> contact</font>

1725
01:21:41,650 --> 01:21:45,730
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these four contacts</font>

1726
01:21:43,989 --> 01:21:48,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">are even these two different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> contacts</font>

1727
01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:53,070
can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to register this specific</font>

1728
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:53,070
domain or this domain under this TLD

1729
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:04,150
CalFire I've read the draft and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

1730
01:22:02,619 --> 01:22:08,230
think on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the certain circumstances</font>

1731
01:22:04,150 --> 01:22:13,280
there's some utility to it but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1732
01:22:08,230 --> 01:22:15,379
wondering is whether it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth</font>

1733
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:16,969
expanding the scope at the risk of

1734
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:19,520
making it more difficult to adopt

1735
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:20,990
because there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are</font>

1736
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,490
not associated with the contact so

1737
01:22:20,990 --> 01:22:24,679
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're still not going to</font>

1738
01:22:22,490 --> 01:22:26,210
know everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know to</font>

1739
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:27,680
register a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> name there are</font>

1740
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:29,960
some requirements that are based on the

1741
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:31,700
string of the name for example may be

1742
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:36,230
trademarks that sort of thing they won't

1743
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:38,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">be associated with the contact so it's</font>

1744
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:40,940
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a narrow solution and I wonder if</font>

1745
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:43,130
there's a thought to expand it or or

1746
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:47,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very focused on this one type of</font>

1747
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:49,940
scenario<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks car and actually we not</font>

1748
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:52,040
knowing what those specific things are

1749
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:53,900
we tried to create a generic form of the

1750
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:57,050
key value so that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use other</font>

1751
01:22:53,900 --> 01:23:01,040
things as as a validator so that maybe

1752
01:22:57,050 --> 01:23:03,140
you know to register<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot bank you have</font>

1753
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:04,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have an ID or something and you know</font>

1754
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:06,980
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can pass that in through the key</font>

1755
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:09,769
value of this saying here's a registrant

1756
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:12,379
and here's their ID you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1757
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:14,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a response back from that outside of</font>

1758
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:21,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that was about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as generic was we</font>

1759
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:26,349
could make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so any other questions or</font>

1760
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:28,400
comments the request is to make this a

1761
01:23:26,350 --> 01:23:31,160
working group document for the work

1762
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:34,040
group to agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on in general</font>

1763
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:35,690
you know the primary<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for a</font>

1764
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:37,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group to this working group to</font>

1765
01:23:35,690 --> 01:23:39,769
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take to work on is is to move</font>

1766
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:42,679
it on to the standards track<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1767
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:44,900
publication you know the option to talk

1768
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:46,580
about drafts is always open in any case

1769
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:51,320
in the working group but you're looking

1770
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:52,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">for standards track for this so if</font>

1771
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:54,530
there's no more discussion I guess let

1772
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:57,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">me call the question and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look for a</font>

1773
01:23:54,530 --> 01:24:00,080
sense of the room here to folks agree

1774
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:03,380
that we should adopt this work as a as a

1775
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:05,540
working group document and the you know

1776
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:08,900
what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means is is it's on a path to</font>

1777
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:10,400
go to standards track so all those in

1778
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:15,320
favor of adopting this as a working

1779
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:19,190
group document hum please and all those

1780
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:21,860
opposed I actually did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not hear any</font>

1781
01:24:19,190 --> 01:24:22,190
opposition in the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think that's</font>

1782
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:26,000
a good

1783
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:27,830
and we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> also do one last request on</font>

1784
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,239
the mailing list just to make sure but I

1785
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:31,250
think there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was overwhelming consensus</font>

1786
01:24:29,239 --> 01:24:33,199
here in the room to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward so</font>

1787
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:34,699
we'll post that question on the mailing

1788
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:36,919
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> too just to see if anything comes</font>

1789
01:24:34,699 --> 01:24:38,929
from that and Scott please Scott

1790
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:40,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hollenbeck here and not picking on Roger</font>

1791
01:24:38,930 --> 01:24:43,130
but I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a suggestion</font>

1792
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:44,960
for everyone as you are coming to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1793
01:24:43,130 --> 01:24:47,330
group and asking you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move a document</font>

1794
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:48,920
into the working group I'm sorry I

1795
01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:51,410
forget the number but we had a recently

1796
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:53,150
published RFC in the 7000 series that

1797
01:24:51,410 --> 01:24:56,480
described how to add implementation

1798
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:57,259
status sections to documents I think you

1799
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,429
know one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we are</font>

1800
01:24:57,260 --> 01:25:00,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">struggling with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that we have a very</font>

1801
01:24:58,430 --> 01:25:01,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">large number of documents here that</font>

1802
01:25:00,110 --> 01:25:03,980
don't seem to be getting a lot of

1803
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:06,020
attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really like to see people</font>

1804
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:08,030
adding these implementation status

1805
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:10,130
sections to the documents so that we

1806
01:25:08,030 --> 01:25:12,110
have a better indicator of who's

1807
01:25:10,130 --> 01:25:13,790
actually paying attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this who is</font>

1808
01:25:12,110 --> 01:25:15,949
actually spending time writing some code

1809
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:17,690
and what kind of experience are you

1810
01:25:15,949 --> 01:25:20,690
having as you try to implement the

1811
01:25:17,690 --> 01:25:21,949
specification so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do agree to take</font>

1812
01:25:20,690 --> 01:25:23,599
this on Roger I would ask could you

1813
01:25:21,949 --> 01:25:26,650
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider adding that particular</font>

1814
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:28,730
section right even if it's blank for now

1815
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:30,799
but that people would look at that and

1816
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:32,959
think yeah do I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try implementing</font>

1817
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,520
this and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know get in touch</font>

1818
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,690
with Roger give him the details so that

1819
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:37,699
he can add some information<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

1820
01:25:35,690 --> 01:25:40,610
document and I just asked God if you

1821
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:46,790
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> afford me what that RSC was it</font>

1822
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:49,219
talks about that next<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nielsen over again</font>

1823
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:50,719
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just repeat what</font>

1824
01:25:49,219 --> 01:25:52,550
I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> before there are no privacy</font>

1825
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:55,850
considerations in this document

1826
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:57,530
whatsoever and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the documents</font>

1827
01:25:55,850 --> 01:26:00,160
would really benefit from having a

1828
01:25:57,530 --> 01:26:04,580
strong consideration on laughs thank you

1829
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:06,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay any other comments do you have any</font>

01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:07,550
other questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> right no thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1831
01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:11,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">right well thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very much then</font>

1832
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:13,040
excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that leaves us with four</font>

formal request to the middle east but

1874

01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:11,059
those I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

1878
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:15,250
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the currently expired dress</font>

1879
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:15,250
right I think correctly<font color="#E5E5E5"> labeled are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1880
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:20,480
any any comments from the room about

1881
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:22,910
about these documents at the moment and

1882
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:25,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can a quick reactions I think my</font>

1883
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:27,290
suggestion is going to be to suggest it

1884
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:29,390
on the mailing list and give people a

1885
01:28:27,290 --> 01:28:30,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">pointer the documents and give everyone</font>

1886
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:34,100
a chance just to take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at them</font>

1887
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:36,920
again um i think i agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you i</font>

1888
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:37,530
suspect they do fall within the remit to

1889
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:40,530
this working

1890
01:28:37,530 --> 01:28:42,300
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> um probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to check with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

1891
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:44,610
ad to make sure that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not out of</font>

1892
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:50,100
scope from the Charter the Charter is is

1893
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:55,049
fairly narrowly scoped so to the extent

1894
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:56,880
these are our dab issues and I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1895
01:28:55,050 --> 01:28:59,640
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they might be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to fit</font>

1896
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:02,190
narrowly into our<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter but we'll have</font>

1897
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:03,690
to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lady</font>

1898
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:07,769
here make sure they fall into the right

1899
01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:09,419
place it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Louis I mean Jim and I at one</font>

1900
01:29:07,770 --> 01:29:12,180
time we're a ball chair for this topic

1901
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:14,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">about five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago six years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so um</font>

1902
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:16,800
the one question<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have here is do you</font>

1903
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:19,169
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these documents still need</font>

1904
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,900
more work as part of a working group or

1905
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:23,430
do you want to make sure these documents

1906
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:26,099
get proper you just the matter of

1907
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:28,170
publicizing<font color="#E5E5E5"> or I mean doc Ewing is to</font>

1908
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:30,060
give a standard document that you could

1909
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:31,370
refer to like do they mean much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

1910
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:37,170
work with is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to get these</font>

1911
01:29:31,370 --> 01:29:38,910
published so as more data points I've

1912
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:40,920
been pushed the registry select for

1913
01:29:38,910 --> 01:29:43,860
example the optional reseller field

1914
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:46,680
trailer name the optional register

1915
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:48,750
expiration date we will need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add</font>

1916
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:50,280
those ladder fuels<font color="#CCCCCC"> in to do that I screw</font>

1917
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:51,450
because if sunrise we start using those

1918
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:53,460
data fields I mean we will need to

1919
01:29:51,450 --> 01:29:55,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">escrow those at some point so I think</font>

1920
01:29:53,460 --> 01:30:03,900
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we still need to do some work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1921
01:29:55,170 --> 01:30:07,290

<font color="#CCCCCC">right so um I think yeah my my comment</font>

1923
01:30:07,290 --> 01:30:11,640
would be to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the suggestion on the</font>

1924
01:30:09,330 --> 01:30:13,950
mailing list and between now and when

1925

1926
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:19,349
chat with our ad about about these

01:30:55,239 --> 01:30:58,809
on filling some gaps in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> depth that</font>

1943
01:30:57,310 --> 01:31:00,040
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are implementing our DAP you</font>

1944
01:30:58,810 --> 01:31:02,409
might actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a peek at</font>

1945
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:04,090
all right and two<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I will</font>

1946
01:31:02,409 --> 01:31:06,339
probably be bringing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working</font>

three if you are interested in client

1950
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:15,969
authentication and being able to use

1951
01:31:13,869 --> 01:31:18,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">that information to limit exposure of</font>

1952
01:31:15,969 --> 01:31:20,290
PII and all that fun stuff I do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1953
01:31:18,489 --> 01:31:21,848
document<font color="#CCCCCC"> that describes how you can</font>

1954
01:31:20,290 --> 01:31:24,790
implement our gap with federated

1955
01:31:21,849 --> 01:31:27,159
authentication take a peek please I've

1956
01:31:24,790 --> 01:31:29,019
got running code any working experiment

1957
01:31:27,159 --> 01:31:30,848
if you want to look at it the experiment

1958
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:34,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">is open to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> public anyone can touch</font>

1959
01:31:30,849 --> 01:31:37,449
this right now okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> option</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or document</font>

1960
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:39,520
number two if you've taken a look at the

1961
01:31:37,449 --> 01:31:41,169
search functionality that's available in

1962
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:43,119
korad car I'd up you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be wondering</font>

1963
01:31:41,170 --> 01:31:45,280
what were those authors thinking when

1964
01:31:43,119 --> 01:31:48,210
they came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this it's kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of lame</font>

1965
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:50,050
its kind of restrictive kind of useless

1966
01:31:48,210 --> 01:31:52,480
but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens when you're</font>

1967
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:54,310
dealing with rough consensus anyway I've

1968
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:57,610
