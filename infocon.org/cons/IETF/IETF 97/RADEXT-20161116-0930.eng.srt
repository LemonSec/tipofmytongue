23
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:45,940
actually helping you doing the minutes

24
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:49,060
you could use a pipette we could all do

25
00:01:45,940 --> 00:02:00,130
minutes but I need one designated person

26
00:01:49,060 --> 00:02:05,770
anyway yeah remote participants are

27
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:07,958
usually the best minute taking mmm<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

28
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,788
guys I'm the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only chair here today so I</font>

29
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:13,260
don't have a chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> of taking minutes</font>

30
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:13,260
myself so it really has to be somebody

31
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:23,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so Ryan is 30 minutes thank you um</font>

33
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,149
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will give a short overview about</font>

34
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:31,750
our document size now now talk much that

35
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:33,189
is overview um as you will see<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that</font>

36
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,630
overview it's a bit special this time

37
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:39,049
because um pretty much

38
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:41,840
most / almost all of our documents which

39
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,910
we have on the charger are pretty much

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,890
done so we don't have anybody talking

41
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:49,220
about active working group grafts this

42
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:52,730
time so instead we will have plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

43
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,859
new things to talk about and I think

44
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great opportunity to</font>

45
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">think again about what radix to be doing</font>

46
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,050
the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's an influx of work</font>

47
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,800
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I find that pretty well so there's</font>

48
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,190
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a 10-minute presentation</font>

54
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:22,100
so enemy is actually presenting this in

sac and he is aiming for an ad

56
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,530
sponsorship but this is something we

57
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:29,120
should well<font color="#E5E5E5"> we might want to be aware of</font>

58
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:33,440
even though there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> radius in the</font>

59

very well received and very vivid

63
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:45,470
discussions around it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's gonna be</font>

64
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:46,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hope and lastly there is a not</font>

65
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,830
quite ready work about proxy

66
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,410
considerations how to do proxy write and

67
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:55,010

70
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:04,280
surprised and finally our<font color="#E5E5E5"> five minutes</font>

71
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:07,070
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rapid next steps and actually</font>

72
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,780
well we should have 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes of leeway</font>

73
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,750
at that point so everybody gets to the

74
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,459
next meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on but again if you feel</font>

75
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:20,810
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to discuss something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please do</font>

76
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:23,600
go ahead so speaking about our document

77
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:27,380
status um so we didn't manage to publish

78
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,420
in RFC just yet since last ITF but we do

79
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,460
have one document in<font color="#E5E5E5"> DRC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> editor q and</font>

80
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,770
that's the radius extensions for IP port

81
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:37,090
configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> reporting it's in a</font>

82
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:39,200
legendary revision number 17 meanwhile

83
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,609
to be honest I thought we need lots of

84
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,930
at end of time this time to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

85
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">this one because it's sailed into a</font>

86
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:47,060
perfect storm when the IES do you value

87
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,740
I did it but as it turned out all of the

88
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,610
issues were solved by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the men in this</font>

89
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,870
and document was allowed to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

90
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,210
status i have on the slide is actually

91
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,860
from yesterday when the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

92
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,380
had a missing reference which was data

93
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,020
types but the idea is moving fast so

94
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:06,440
data types actually meanwhile proceeded

95
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:09,049
to the RC editor<font color="#E5E5E5"> q so both of these</font>

96
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:13,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">documents are going out any time now as</font>

97
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:15,319
soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the editor is done editing um in</font>

98
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">that context the other document we have</font>

99
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:22,819
data types in radius arm is still set

100
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:25,340
out here as<font color="#CCCCCC"> eyes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> g approved but</font>

101
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:28,610
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours ago it went to the RFC</font>

102
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,799
editor<font color="#CCCCCC"> q so these were two working group</font>

103
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,069
items which we don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do anything</font>

104
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,069
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore so can we considered down</font>

105
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:40,849
here and that's pretty much empty is our

106
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:42,560
charter set for two documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> um one of</font>

107
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:45,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">which we also have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very much done in</font>

108
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,979
terms of working group stage sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

109
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:51,080
a note on the jabber jabber so Allen the

110
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:54,949
Cook says the data tab was just accepted

111
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:57,229
for publication by the iesg and a new

112
00:05:54,949 --> 00:06:00,969
revision will be published after the

113
00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:03,710
April document has done its iono updates

114
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:06,320
so that the data type document includes

115
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:12,229
data type for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AP port</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tribute</font>

116
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:14,000
attributes yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay data types is going</font>

117
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:15,889
to have its fair share of iron actions

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,150
because it's creating a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge long list</font>

119
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:25,340
of every return registry but i guess not

120
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:26,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">a bit p phi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and anyway um so the last</font>

121
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,960
two documents we actually have on our

122
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:33,560
agenda is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dynamic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of our ization</font>

123
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:37,909
proxying we had a one in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last call</font>

124
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:40,400
just after the ITF 96 meeting and nobody

125
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:45,169
spoke up so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that as a good sign</font>

126
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,549
and this means my process when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

127
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:48,380
asked or completed without comments

128
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,960
means we can move forward with

129
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,940
publication so we still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to assign a</font>

130
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">deck document shepherds and do the</font>

131
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,320
document right up turns out that leone

132
00:06:55,849 --> 00:07:00,150
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> war isn't here today so</font>

133
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,640
well that was a mistake so we have a new

134
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:04,590
chef Rick no just kidding am so nearly

135
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,960
let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll sort it out who is</font>

136
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,940
shepherding these documents but it's on

137
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,060
its way basically and stuff in water be

138
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,670
done and the last document we have is

139
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:17,160
then my own document on considerations

140
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:20,190
on how to use eep response identity

141
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,640

142
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:25,410

143
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,810
it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rack up slide and that's</font>

144
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:30,210
basically all it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only document</font>

145
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,530
that is actually still<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the works in</font>

146
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:38,340
this working group in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

147
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:42,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">charter so then we have these proposals</font>

148
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:44,190
for new work so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jim chart want you to do</font>

149
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,850
the radios TLS this document at some

150
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:50,840
point so you if you don't have nothing

151
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,840
really don't have to say anything you

152
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:59,940
yeah I ran out of time in the last thing

153
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:03,030
I expect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an ID ready for Alan to</font>

154
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:08,010
look at within a month so it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

155
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:09,450
up everything linear<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and yeah this</font>

156
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:12,270
would be a document which is very

157
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:14,270
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside our chargers I think</font>

158
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:17,010
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is clearly knew were coming up um</font>

159
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:19,830
we also have the laura1 authentication

160
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:21,750
radios the<font color="#CCCCCC"> office submitted in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no to</font>

161
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,849
version or just be caught before the

162
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:27,030
cutoff<font color="#CCCCCC"> mmm and we discuss about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

163
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:31,590
today um<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good reception already</font>

164
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:33,390
so let's let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> see how it goes another</font>

165
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:36,030
document that is surfing around since of

166
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:39,689
why now is the radius extensions for

167
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:42,780
network assisted multipath TCP there is

168
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:44,640
meanwhile in our free version and the

169
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">authors requested a call for adoption so</font>

170
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:51,540
I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's any problem with</font>

171
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:53,600
that so as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I DF is over I will</font>

172
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,069
start a two-week call for adoption

173
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">please do read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the latest revision first</font>

174
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,360
and then form your opinion do you think

175
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,110
that's something we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be working on</font>

176
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:07,860
in a text or not

177
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:10,050
and last well maybe at least I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

178
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,450
know is the extended packet header for

179
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:15,359
radius there was a presentation last

180
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:18,140
time and an initial draft to be honest I

181
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,090
didn't hear any updates from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors</font>

182
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,650
they also got fair amount of beating in

183
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting so I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

184
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:27,120
their what their plans are for this one

185
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:30,780
unless I hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> from them I think we can</font>

186
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:35,460
drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> this off the radar unless they say</font>

187
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:39,750
otherwise right that's that's it for the

188
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:42,510
your document update so let's now think

189
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,370
about the video draft discussion and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

190
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:51,750
first one up would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Ryan for the</font>

191
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:59,460
radius extensions for mud and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font>

192
00:09:51,750 --> 00:10:02,820
seconds you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have just might good morning</font>

193
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,930
this is so this work is in conjunction

194
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,480
with some work that's happening the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OP</font>

195
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:09,689
started working group and you can go to

196
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,700
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide please so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

197
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,840
everybody understands for the events the

198
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,210
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks there's no longer any</font>

199
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,640
doubt<font color="#CCCCCC"> that how to devices are under</font>

200
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:20,430
attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we knew that already before</font>

201
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,020
but this is and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the some work</font>

202
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,750
we've been doing for some time<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

203
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:27,840
try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address this we understand that</font>

204
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,580
not only the device is under attack like

205
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,410
so are the network's the devices to

206
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,410
attach to and that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the focus</font>

207
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:37,400
that we've come from you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how can we</font>

208
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:39,540
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> increase in security the network</font>

209
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,220
from these things that are just it's

210
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,620
hopeless just assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're secure</font>

211
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:47,040
her ever will be secure sup next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font>

212
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">please so what our goal is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

213
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">protect the network from the things and</font>

214
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,710
put up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network I'm</font>

215
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,460
sorry to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep looking up here but I</font>

216
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:58,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't see otherwise and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the from a</font>

217
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,700
network security perspective think we

218
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,140
don't understand that the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> place to</font>

219
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,330
protect against something connected to

220
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,160
your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that the network edge</font>

221
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:09,870
where the support that this is connected

222
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:11,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to and that's what we'd like to do we</font>

223
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,360
also understand that most of these

224
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,730
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are gonna be authenticating</font>

225
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,600
themselves with 82 that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X so though</font>

226
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,370
there's some provision for that

227
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,130
but practically speaking many of them

228
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,199
won't we also understand that there'll

229
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:25,509
be a lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> types of IOT</font>

230
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:27,729
things showing up and we it's really

231
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:29,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to be impractical to assume that</font>

232
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,089
on your triple a server that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

233
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,740
going to know about them ahead of time

234
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:34,600
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to sign some sort of policy</font>

235
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,920
to them you'll certainly never really

236
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,360
know what kind of network access these

237
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,250
things need and you'd really like to be

238
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to restrict the neck great access</font>

239
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,560
to to what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is they just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need that is</font>

240
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:48,370
to try and reduce the threat profile of

241
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,989
these things so in fact most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the time</font>

242
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,509
they have very simple needs which is

243
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,920
they need to talk to an dhcp server get

244
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:56,410
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> address and then they've got some</font>

245
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,430
manager somewhere in the enterprise or

246
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,589
in the cloud that they have to actually

247
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:02,019
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to for example maybe they're</font>

248
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:03,509
relaying sensor data up to it or<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

249
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:07,240
they're getting data back down from<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

250
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:10,449
but what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really like is to just have</font>

251
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,850
these things be allowed on your network

252
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:14,620
to do just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just get dates to be for</font>

253
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,940
example and just talk to its supposed to

254
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,750
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> but how in are we going to know</font>

255
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:22,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and given the previous statements I</font>

256
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,189
made so the goal is with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

257
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,370
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> manufacturer usage descriptions</font>

258
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:32,170
where a manufacturer can describe usage

259
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:35,709
of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this device needs and go to the</font>

260
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,750
next slide please so the main draft is

261
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:41,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">this off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Terry working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group craft and</font>

262
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:44,410
very simply what the way that mud is

263
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,209
intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work and is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it their</font>

264
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:49,649
manufacture when you produce a device he

265
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:55,689
does a couple of things he crazy

266
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:58,240
basically a file on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

267
00:12:55,689 --> 00:13:00,939
particular format that describes if you

268
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,170
will what we're really interested in

269
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:04,480
what he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to describe is some</font>

270
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,880
information about network access policy

271
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,430
that's necessary and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty of the</font>

272
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,509
device woody manufactures the devices it

273
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:14,649
includes a URI<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of the discovery</font>

274
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:16,449
protocols that this thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to</font>

275
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:17,920
send out which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a hint</font>

276
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:20,620
telling that<font color="#CCCCCC"> where Kate if you want to</font>

277
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,630
know more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about me go resolve this uri</font>

278
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:27,459
and it'll tell you some interesting

279
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:30,370
things so this draft defines the format

280
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:32,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the file defines different what</font>

281
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:36,580
is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URI can be propagated by the</font>

282
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:40,960
device which could be a third DHCP

283
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:42,339
option or LDP tlv and then additionally

284
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,620
could also come in x509certificate

285
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:46,839
there's a certificate extension that's

286
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,670
been defined but for the purposes of

287
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,460
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion that's not as</font>

288
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:53,020
interesting as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other two so once</font>

289
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,450
those that you aright to the network

290
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,730
then the network can forward that to the

291
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,050
radius server and he can work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

292
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">associated device called the mud</font>

293
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:03,609

00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:05,110
resolve<font color="#E5E5E5"> the or I and discover what's in</font>

295
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,589
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> created</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ackles and then send it down</font>

296
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:11,410
to the access port on the network on the

297
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:12,580
network edge so what we've discovered in

298
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,550
when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were going through implementing</font>

299
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:18,700
this is well if this is coming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> dhcp</font>

300
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:20,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> LDP access port can pick this thing</font>

301
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,300
up but he really<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to</font>

302
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,819
get this to the radio server so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

303
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new attribute in radius to send that</font>

304
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">off to the radius server and that's</font>

305
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:31,120
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this draft is doing after all</font>

306
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:35,199
that explanation but it's a missing

307
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:38,020
piece of the puzzle next slide please so

308
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,550
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the is just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Pretoria Lee when</font>

309
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,069
I was just mentioning you can see at the

310
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:45,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">top that the thing is advertising then</font>

311
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:47,770
my dr<font color="#E5E5E5"> i then that network edge needs to</font>

312
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,120
forward that over radius to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> triple-a</font>

313
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:53,620
server which is working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this mud</font>

314
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:56,920
controller sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> role to resolve this</font>

315
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:59,170
mud file<font color="#CCCCCC"> My dear I to get the file back</font>

316
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,849
great the apples<font color="#E5E5E5"> and send them back down</font>

317
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,430
and the only thing missing is what's in

318
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:07,510
red so that's what this draft does next

319
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:15,209
line please in fact that's most of the

320
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:18,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">draft I guess is describing a attribute</font>

321
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:21,579
this necessary Ellen had commented

322
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,680
against the dash<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 0 that we should be</font>

323
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">using the data types draft so we'll be</font>

324
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,550
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the next version instead of</font>

325
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,770
putting the ASCII art in but we still

326
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:33,459
would need the same thing in the end

327
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:36,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide there's a little bit of</font>

328
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:40,030
context in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft around what I just</font>

329
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,949
described verbally and then there's some

330
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:43,990
security considerations in there about

331
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,220
well so she

332
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:50,440
you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> except this year I that's</font>

333
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:52,839
coming across<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe unsecured or if and</font>

334
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,570
another and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next steps that</font>

335
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,700
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Talon pointed out in his</font>

336
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:59,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">comments that maybe the radio service</font>

337
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,440
should be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little worried about what</font>

338
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:04,029
he's getting you or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrive in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

339
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,680
from this radius attribute that maybe

340
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:07,450
didn't come in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ascent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ocado fashion</font>

341
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:15,099
so the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things is</font>

342
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:17,020
generally yes if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URI comes</font>

343
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,500
unprotected you really shouldn't

344
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:22,180
completely protect it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

345
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,980
so there's two answers to<font color="#E5E5E5"> two sort of</font>

346
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:27,099
points here at one point is it's

347
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,899
definitely helping devices that are not

348
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,670
lying in that they are protecting

349
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:32,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">themselves and there's value in that and</font>

350
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,349
then the question is how do we protect

351
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,399
against devices that are lying and

352
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,870
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer is you need some</font>

353
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,050
correlating information some device

354
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:43,149
profiling or some other kind of events

355
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you're actually looking at the</font>

356
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:45,610
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this thing and deciding if</font>

357
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:50,200
he's really acting as that kind of

358
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:51,820
device or not this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's a little</font>

359
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,440
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a fuzzy answer but that's that's</font>

360
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,779
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much where we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the best</font>

361
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,490
possible approach really would be Ford

362
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:58,630
assembly<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or I in the certificate in</font>

363
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,000
which case we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need this radius</font>

364
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:03,189
option but in that case it's going

365
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,099
already to the triple a server it's

366
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:07,720
actually as part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fennec ation</font>

367
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:09,250
certificate authentication validation

368
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,140
he's going to actually discover the<font color="#CCCCCC"> URI</font>

369
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,449
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you can get the resolved and</font>

370
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,160
get the policy from there but as I said

371
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:18,089
we understand most devices aren't going

372
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,429
to act like that place to start with I

373
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:23,948
think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be my last slide yeah so</font>

374
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:26,829
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just a request for comments</font>

375
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:29,440
we're not ready to ask that for anything

376
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:33,100
beyond that at this point as the mud

377
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,480
draft proceeds we may asked we probably

378
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,649
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for this to be working</font>

379
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,800
group item but I think we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> wait a</font>

380
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:40,800
little bit that so any comments

381
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:50,960
so I come on a comment on jabber from

382
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">Alan vendors have historically had a</font>

383
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,030
hard time keeping web servers up for

384
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,770
example for for firmware updates and

385
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:00,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry could you see that yet so vendors</font>

386
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:04,610
have historically had hard time keeping

387
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:06,800
web servers up or keeping domains

388
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:09,560
registered so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a large chance</font>

389
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:13,600
that the URI is non-existent or

390
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:15,830
malicious so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a your eye</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

391
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,570
non-existent it's certainly possible

392
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:22,790
that is to say maybe the manufacturer

393
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:24,260
goes out of business right so if it's

394
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:26,420
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you're no worse than you were</font>

395
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:28,460
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't have a URI I would say</font>

396
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:32,030
that second<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all there's certainly</font>

397
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:35,590
strategies were you I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be put on a</font>

398
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:38,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">third-party server something like that</font>

399
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:41,389
actually Impractical circumstances I

400
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:43,490
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect the mud controller sort of</font>

401
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:45,140
operation<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably to cash it after he</font>

402
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,280
gets it the first time so he always<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

403
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,530
it available so that would help at least

404
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">a particular enterprise that has seen</font>

405
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:53,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of these before but it wouldn't</font>

406
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:55,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">worst help help other people have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

407
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,230
seen it<font color="#E5E5E5"> before but as I say if they</font>

408
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,820
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolve it well it's they're no</font>

409
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:03,560
worse off than they were before I'm

410
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:06,439
terms of malicious your eyes really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

411
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:10,460
just need to as I've said<font color="#CCCCCC"> before I'm not</font>

412
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:13,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure I've a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better answer then you need</font>

413
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:16,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do some additional device profiling</font>

414
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:18,860
and evaluation of the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

415
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:22,850
thing using maybe some IDs or something

416
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:25,370
the additionally of course there's you

417
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,990
can put<font color="#E5E5E5"> things on so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can put RT</font>

devices in particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans and there's</font>

419
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:31,310
other sorts of separation techniques

420
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:33,670
that could also might you must also do

421
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:35,510
along with<font color="#CCCCCC"> akal right there's there's no</font>

422
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:37,400
restriction here on what you would

423
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">normally do with your policy it's just</font>

424
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,250
we're trying to give the network a hint

425
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,810
of hey this is this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the kind of</font>

426
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,820
device it is and here's a hint about

427
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:45,909
what kind of access it needs and then

428
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,169
they certainly the radius server can

429
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,940
apply any kind of policy of months as he

430
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:51,920
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally we're just trying to</font>

431
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,549
automate the ability for him to know

432
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,159
what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and what</font>

433
00:19:53,549 --> 00:20:02,639
when it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do I don't know Alan if</font>

434
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:06,059
that answered your question and on um

435
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:09,330
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so uh personally to the pitching so</font>

436
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:12,029
Alexandra<font color="#CCCCCC"> probe on this I agree and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

437
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:14,158
maybe of course this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font>

438
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:17,190
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft but mostly of the mud</font>

439
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:21,899
draft that's that's going to be there it

440
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:25,019
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> because IOT devices will tend to to</font>

441
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:26,609
live much longer now without potentially

442
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:29,070
without for more updates then what we

443
00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:30,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">are seeing today so this could be you</font>

444
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:34,200
know it could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see how</font>

445
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:37,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mad draft advances in in the other</font>

446
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:40,169
working group on a personal note I i

447
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:42,509
find this work<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

448
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:47,220
think that this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'd</font>

449
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:50,940
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to see in the radius and then on</font>

450
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:52,590
jabber going back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alan so he's</font>

451
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,859
expressing his opinion that prancing

452
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:57,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jason is hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lots of buffer overflows</font>

453
00:20:55,859 --> 00:21:00,149
in Jason parsers and time out some

454
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:03,809
non-existent your eyes can affect radius

455
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:07,758
servers so just like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> general remark</font>

456
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:14,609
that parsing the mud file can

457
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:18,799
potentially be of some danger and that

458
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:18,799
it was at the mud filer than my dear I

459
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:25,199
so processing.js in his heart<font color="#CCCCCC"> so he's</font>

460
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:29,100
referring something to I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure I</font>

461
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,710
check<font color="#E5E5E5"> part and then 2 more comments so</font>

462
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:34,259
Alan agrees that you're you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are pretty</font>

463
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,850
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> answered answer his question and he</font>

464
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:37,980
also thinks it's interesting and useful

465
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:45,029
as work all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

466
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:47,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">comments okay thank you very soon yeah</font>

467
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:48,779
you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just a sec idea i also have</font>

468
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,879
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of questions all as an individual</font>

469
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:52,970
do you underst as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideal video I'm</font>

470
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:56,189
very sympathetic to the through the much

471
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:59,260
work I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to wrap my head</font>

472
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,880
around here so what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

473
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,460
on the network edge here is what we

474
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,930
would usually call the mass and device

475
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:09,360
they just try to authenticate with the

476
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:12,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">IOT thing but you know it's this draft</font>

477
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,780
basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nass also is the</font>

478
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:19,600
authenticated device by proxy well

479
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:24,600
actually we didn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that so</font>

480
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:27,250
if the then as should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be just forwarding</font>

481
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,659
me in it in a standard environment with

482
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,700
the radius server you should be just

483
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,040
forwarding you the URI off to the radius

484
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,780
server to decide essentially it's an

485
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,610
informative thing right the radius

486
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,960
server can decide I could ignore it or

487
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,419
he could decide to use it as I was

488
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:44,460
describing earlier so we and the

489
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:46,630
certainly you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom line</font>

490
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're showing from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the trip flies over</font>

491
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:50,080
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network edge after the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nez</font>

492
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,429
there's absolutely no change there

493
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,429
whatsoever effect in our implementation

494
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:56,320
you knows all existing attributes you

495
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,430
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brady's attributes is just cost</font>

496
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,360
because you're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

497
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,920
thing you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other device</font>

498
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,189
at that point you just we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

499
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,720
enable the ability to to decide what

500
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,780
those after it should be yeah that's

501
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,730
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> my point so hmm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

502
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:12,420
device can trigger the authentication

503
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:16,000
itself because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was gonna fight so</font>

504
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:18,430
then the man's here has to decide this

505
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,140
is an IOT device connecting to me and do

506
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:23,020
I have to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> this authentication by</font>

507
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,810
proxy roll forward and then my<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

508
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:28,540
is there is only this DHCP option and if

509
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:29,980
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nest will act on it</font>

510
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,620
and then do stuff and consider the

511
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:37,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">device being an IOT device but if that's</font>

512
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:40,290
correct um maybe there's some

513
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:43,840
interesting attack coming up itself

514
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:46,870
let's imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows PCs get very</font>

515
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,510
popular virus and they just have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send</font>

516
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:52,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">a dhcp option with the target</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they wanna</font>

517
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:54,250
do s and all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sudden everybody will</font>

518
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,750
try to get a huge file from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that web</font>

519
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,750
server and the web server goes down

520
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:07,450
okay I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> answers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes I mean I but</font>

521
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:10,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's no different in probably a lot of</font>

522
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:16,960
other situations<font color="#CCCCCC"> so in any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case here one</font>

523
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:20,680
must be careful with right yeah okay

524
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,390
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you and please if you</font>

525
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,610
have more comments send them on the list

526
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,930
will be producing an adapter one in a

527
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:37,360
bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time with resolving some of these</font>

528
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:39,940
comments okay thank you Brian then the

529
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,429
next one up is the HTTP packet signing

530
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:46,230
my idea to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1x and please give me a</font>

531
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:52,720
few seconds to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get skype and the slides</font>

532
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:54,340
up and running so um how long do you

533
00:24:52,720 --> 00:25:02,020
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call me with video without video</font>

534
00:24:54,340 --> 00:25:03,159
many time do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it now because we didn't</font>

535
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:12,250
pre announced that we need remote

536
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:14,470
participation possibilities and ok so if

537
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:16,180
audio is enough I'm told<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can</font>

538
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:18,360
just push the button and get in the

539
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,360
queue

540
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,550
any of them would work but neither of

541
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">them does</font>

542
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:18,870
oh wait a second now to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

543
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:23,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right so if you put up the slides</font>

544
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:26,409
this is work which came out of the

545
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:30,550
security area where there was some

546
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:34,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">discussion of the dhcpv6 and various</font>

547
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:38,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">dhcp security options and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pointed out</font>

548
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:41,250
that dhcp v4 was entirely insecure and

549
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:44,410
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> perhaps we might want to leverage</font>

550
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:49,540
in 0<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 and X</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you go to the next</font>

551
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:52,120
slide yeah there's no ties between 80 2

552
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:55,450
and X and dhcp so you have this

553
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:58,600
wonderful super secure TLS enabled

554
00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:01,510
method to get on the network you prove

555
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,820
who you are you prove that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

556
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:06,670
the network is and soon as you're on the

557
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:10,149
network you send this DGP packet and

558
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:13,750
hopefully someone somewhere who might be

559
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:16,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the current bgp server answers on the</font>

560
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:22,240
point from<font color="#E5E5E5"> ted lemon and various other</font>

561
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:26,379
DGP people was that the switch mostly

562
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:29,200
blocks all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad DGP traffic so you're</font>

563
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:33,490
pretty sure that you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

564
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:35,530
realty H&P server um but it never<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurts</font>

565
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:39,929
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have cryptographic signing in my</font>

566
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:42,910
opinion so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to the next slide</font>

567
00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:48,910
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is basically take a page</font>

568
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:52,960
from EEP you have a 2 and X msk various

569
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:55,320
derivation methods for it so like<font color="#CCCCCC"> TTLs</font>

570
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,420
there's you know this string<font color="#CCCCCC"> ttls</font>

571
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:01,178
signing key or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something and you just do</font>

572
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:03,460
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar 14 GP but this thing</font>

573
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:05,679
is that both ends can do I the same key

574
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:07,630
without communicating with each other or

575
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,250
without exchanging things and then you

576
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:17,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">just start signing packets and you gain</font>

577
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:29,700
some additional level of security by how

578
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:33,040
actual security at GP so next slide that

579
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:35,950
sorry still there I think we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

580
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:41,350
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide how does it work you sign the</font>

581
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:44,770
keys yes exchanging the keys so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

582
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:47,080
the beta 2 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> X Server more typically</font>

583
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:50,500
the radius server<font color="#CCCCCC"> leads</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to exchange the</font>

584
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:54,730
keys with the dhcp server and this is

585
00:28:50,500 --> 00:29:00,640
where the phrase you know insert magic

586
00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:03,400
he replies there's no api all between

587
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:07,390
radius and dhcp there's no shared

588
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:09,730
database there there's nothing these

589
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:11,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">keys tend to be fairly secure you</font>

590
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:14,350
probably don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put them in a</font>

591
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,180
database because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he used us on package</font>

592
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:20,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">them other people can get at your</font>

593
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:27,040
database so that sort of implementation

594
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:33,460
to find and open to discussion next

595
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:36,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide so what does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean when you sign</font>

596
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP packets it means that the</font>

597
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:40,210
servers can talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other but</font>

598
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:43,690
they're run by people who talk to each

599
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:45,640
other anything else and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is one of</font>

600
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,320
the questions that Ted London brought up

601
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:54,340
you know does it mean that it's a

602
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:58,300
trusted dhcp server well no because you

603
00:29:54,340 --> 00:30:03,129
know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a new thing we're adding</font>

604
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:05,200
with new new meaning all you can say if

605
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:08,790
the minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that the two servers have</font>

606
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:13,630
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to each other and exchange data</font>

607
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:15,310
next slide so problems yeah there's a

608
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:18,250
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of details not worked out it's sort</font>

609
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:19,870
of a stab in the dark at this point DGP

610
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:23,830
doesn't provide for capability

611
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:27,159
negotiation so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no way for either</font>

612
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:29,270
in to say that they could do this other

613
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:32,540
than they just start signing back

614
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:35,510
it's better to<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ex doesn't provide for</font>

615
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:37,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">this kind of capability negotiation so</font>

616
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:41,090
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no real way in any of the</font>

617
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:45,379
existing in conversations to say hey I

618
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:47,570
can do this dhcp thing you might

619
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:51,640
shoehorn it into the inner tunnel in

620
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:55,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">TTLs because that allows you to exchange</font>

621
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:57,650
any radius attributes essentially bought

622
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:59,659
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> generic and it's not really</font>

623
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:01,370
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for any other three batteries so</font>

624
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:05,600
there's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> lil wayne for either end</font>

625
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:10,399
to signal that this is happening so next

626
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:13,459
slide so the questions is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a good idea</font>

627
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:19,070
does it help security does it not hurt

628
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:23,330
security can it be implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> and will</font>

629
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:26,389
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement it I know for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me taking</font>

630
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:29,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">a look at it I can cheat a little bit</font>

631
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:32,600
here because I can radiate radiant /

632
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,179
dhcp server that caches the keys in

633
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,699
memory it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know maybe a thousand</font>

634
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:40,670
lines of code and a couple of flags<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

635
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:43,220
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> configuration file somewhere other</font>

636
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:45,020
people who have other implementations

637
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:49,720
will find this rather substantially more

638
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:53,180
difficult the question is is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it useful</font>

639
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:55,610
will people do anything with it this is

640
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:58,250
more the discussion for say where

641
00:31:55,610 --> 00:32:02,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">security area work where I expect people</font>

642
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:05,390
to hammer quite quite negatively but

643
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:16,460
it's it's worth a conversation I think

644
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:20,240
that's a questions yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alexander</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pal</font>

645
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:23,030
here on the mic just a short<font color="#E5E5E5"> question on</font>

646
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,000
do you have any<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea how the key</font>

647
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:28,639
exchanges will happen between the

648
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:32,300
triple-a<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the dhcp server so who is</font>

649
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,880
going to initiate the I mean in any

650
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:37,810
initial thoughts on how these<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys will</font>

651
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:42,040
be requested<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the dhcp server or</font>

652
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:42,040
pushed by the radius server

653
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:53,360
the simplest thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think from</font>

654
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:56,639
implementation point of view is for the

655
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:00,120
radius server to tell the dhcp server

656
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:02,809
that it has keys available and either

657
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:06,268
can push the keys via some

658
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:09,389
pre-configured secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> channel but</font>

659
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:12,509
otherwise the dhcp server has to ask the

660
00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:19,789
radius server every time now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dhcp</font>

661
00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:22,440
signing in RFC 3118 allows for a secret

662
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:24,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">identity so it doesn't just sign the</font>

663
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,460
package it says which secret and signed

664
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,759
with so that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the questions you</font>

665
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:32,610
could reserve a number there say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

666
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:35,399
the radius thing but there does have to

667
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:38,758
be some way<font color="#CCCCCC"> for these two systems to</font>

668
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:41,158
communicate or you know the radius

669
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:45,619
server could put a key into a database

670
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,619
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dhcp so that could look it up</font>

671
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:53,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thanks i finally saw this question</font>

672
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,990
really interesting but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

673
00:33:53,700 --> 00:34:01,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">relate to this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because this may be on</font>

674
00:33:54,990 --> 00:34:02,759
the mailing list or or other one<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

675
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,850
i would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question myself and I'm</font>

676
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:08,940
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit slow in terms of which keys</font>

677
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:11,909
are used where so um is this only for

678
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:17,359
EAP methods that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the TLS master</font>

679
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:17,359
session he basically um or

680
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:31,320
hello sir a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would have to be</font>

681
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:36,710
open for you only those eat methods

682
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:43,889
which derive a master session key so Sam

683
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:48,418
TLS TTL s ukk all that kind of stuff not

684
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:50,340
in d5<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just one phone up then that</font>

685
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:52,350
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key material only available to</font>

686
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:55,710
the triple<font color="#E5E5E5"> a servant the supplicant and</font>

687
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:59,990
not the one which is sending the MSM<font color="#E5E5E5"> PPE</font>

688
00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:03,510
keys usually yes those are separate keys

689
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:07,830
so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft as</font>

690
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:13,340
references to TLS to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TTLs think so</font>

691
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:17,400
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> MPGe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Kings are derived by taking</font>

692
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:22,470
server random from TLS and the client

693
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:26,100
random and the fixed string and then

694
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:30,330
don't appear a factual with that that's

695
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:32,069
fine for every eat method and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so did you</font>

696
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:34,860
do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar and say well you</font>

697
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:40,860
have these nests<font color="#E5E5E5"> katie's you go one</font>

698
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:46,880
willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to drive the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> msf</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kinky</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keys and</font>

699
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:46,880
you go another me to derive tht 37 keys

700
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:54,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">Brian wise cisco say Alan I think this</font>

701
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:56,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">is interesting um I do some work and the</font>

702
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:59,669
I Triple E a tattoo that one group on a

703
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:02,580
2 0 and X so I've had some kind of

704
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:05,160
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how we would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

705

extract the<font color="#CCCCCC"> king material and actually</font>

706
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not sure if anybody does that today</font>

707
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,310
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering at me it's an</font>

708
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:13,980
interesting idea if it could even be a

709
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:15,720
more with a general concept 4802 not

710
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">mine x ability to extract king material</font>

711
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:22,470
for different purposes such as TLS i

712
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:23,460
think has that approach today but we

713
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,709
certainly don't have that in the

714
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:28,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">standard i'm not sure how you would do</font>

715
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:31,190
that without changing the standard give

716
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,190
any thoughts on that

717
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:40,780
this requires any changes to get into an

718
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:43,570
ex it's just once you have that msk

719
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:48,760
derived from the deep session you derive

720
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:51,310
an additional key a subkey from that so

721
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:55,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it requires any changes</font>

722
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:59,350
other than implementation changes on the

723
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:03,010
radius server the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TTP the supplicant the</font>

724
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:04,630
dhcp client add the dhcp server and all

725
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:07,270
these systems now have to talk to each

726
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:09,060
other in exchange information but for

727
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:12,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">the point of view of 80 to annex the</font>

728
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:15,759
packets look exactly the same and the

729
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:17,680
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that changes in dhcp is</font>

730
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,440
suddenly the client packets are signed

731
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:26,109
and then the server responses are also

732
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:29,380
saw um do you I'm wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've just</font>

733
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:30,760
thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that TLS extraction</font>

734
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:34,720
method could do you assume the use of

735
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:36,970
epls and you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> msk and could you</font>

736
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:41,609
actually use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> facility to extract</font>

737
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:45,310
that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of getting King Farrel</font>

738
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:49,270
yeah I think so so my initial look

739
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:52,060
through the various eat methods bug show

740
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:53,740
that this seemed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be possible the hope</font>

741
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:56,710
is you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to come up with</font>

742
00:37:53,740 --> 00:38:00,580
derivation which is specific to each eat

743
00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:02,400
method but that might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be required on in</font>

744
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:05,049
which case you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to issue sort of a</font>

745
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,270
jumbo draft that would patch all of the

746
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:16,650
existing eat methods which I'd prefer

747
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:16,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">not to do sure okay thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

748
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:31,040
yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know on jabber by Jim sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

749
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:35,030
yeah so I'll not read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I would say</font>

750
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:37,250
that it's interesting or I I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

751
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:39,650
bitching that it would be worth thinking

752
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:43,790
about a more generalized idea of having

753
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:46,400
this especially for IOT devices where

754
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:49,670
you can you would like to limit the

755
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,500
number of key exchanges over the year so

756
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:53,720
you could you could use the radius

757
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:57,080
server to actually push lots of keys too

758
00:38:53,720 --> 00:39:00,980
many different servers so in this case

759
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:03,319
here we have the DHCP and the in the

760
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:06,080
access point for example but it can be

761
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:09,320
some other servers and if there is like

762
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:12,860
a generic<font color="#E5E5E5"> wave which this could be</font>

763
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:14,870
achieved like pushing the keys two

764
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:20,690
different entities that are not

765
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:26,049
co-located then that will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be that would</font>

766
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:28,820
be a nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have yeah so that</font>

767
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:31,300
that that's interesting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of</font>

768
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:38,140
value read<font color="#CCCCCC"> James comment on Jan or two</font>

769
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:43,010
my only concern with driving a DGP

770
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:48,680
signing key from the nsk that gets sent

771
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:50,870
to the AP is the MSM ppv<font color="#CCCCCC"> genes are</font>

772
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:55,850
visible to everyone in the radius

773
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:59,600
infrastructure but that's sort of bad

774
00:39:55,850 --> 00:40:01,880
for key security on the other end it

775
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,700
does mean that these thtt signing keys

776
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,500
are now independent of the eat method

777
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:09,049
and you don't have to patch on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

778
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,580
existing methods so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

779
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:14,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think desserts longer</font>

780
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:19,340
discussion in security area and lots of

781
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:20,960
flames and arrows from people there<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

782
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,540
so this is Stefan again as a personal

783
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,700
comments I was going to be in those

784
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:28,430
security our discussions and the thing

785
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:30,319
for me is in the Roman Colosseum like we

786
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:31,930
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an addy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rome it may very well be</font>

787
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,640
that the triple<font color="#E5E5E5"> a server the past</font>

788
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:36,669
he is on the other side of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> planet</font>

789
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:39,850
compared to the competitive dhcp server

790
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:42,610
which hands out the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address so in any</font>

791
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:45,819
kinds of a roaming scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this</font>

792
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:48,240
has no chance of flying high if on the

793
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:51,610
other hand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> MSM</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pbdes are being used</font>

794
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,709
maybe it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not perfectly secure but at</font>

795
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:54,640
least it has a chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> of surviving</font>

796
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,170
because it happens in the same

797
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,629
administrative domain because the access

798
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:00,190
point is in that same domain as the dhcp

799
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:04,900
server so<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worth thinking</font>

800
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:15,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">about yes that's that's a very good time</font>

801
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:23,200
to update to draft accordingly<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

802
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:25,270
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that was a good</font>

803
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,879
discussion let's continue in the same

804
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:39,930
spirit with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> laura1 authentication in</font>

805
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:42,850
radius hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh hello everyone I'm Arun I'm</font>

806
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:45,870
going to present the updates and the

807
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:49,810
current status on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> law ro and radius</font>

808
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:52,480
draft so since we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

809
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:55,330
buffer time I would take the opportunity

810
00:41:52,480 --> 00:42:00,130
to have a quick refresher of what is

811
00:41:55,330 --> 00:42:03,250
this draft about so next slide so this

812
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:05,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">is more about the authenticating the</font>

813
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:11,350
device which is really constrained in

814
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:14,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">resources so we have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lp1 architecture</font>

815
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:16,120
here which is which consists of n device

816
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:19,090
which is really constrained and the

817
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:22,150
manufacturer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network server so</font>

818
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:25,720
in the manufacturer he provides certain

819
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:30,130
amount of identifiers and the root key

820
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:32,609
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> N device and also to the network</font>

821
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:37,570
server he provision the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

822
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:39,610
keys and ID's so when the device wants

823
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:42,700
to connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the network he sends a</font>

824
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:44,530
joint request to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network server on</font>

825
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,910
the network server verifies the

826
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:49,329
identities and

827
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:52,960
dear session key and he sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> the joint</font>

828
00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:57,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">accept which is encrypted so here next</font>

829
00:42:52,960 --> 00:43:00,069
slide so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two main messages</font>

830
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:04,390
which are exchanged between the end

831
00:43:00,069 --> 00:43:07,960
device and the network server so the

832
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:10,390
join request has the identifier plus the

833
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:13,630
random numbers which is generated by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

834
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:18,160
end device whereas the joint response or

835
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:19,630
join<font color="#CCCCCC"> accept has the application random</font>

836
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:25,450
number which is generated from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

837
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:27,940
network server so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the rest</font>

838
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:30,669
of the entities or more specifically

839
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:35,710
related to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> raid radio part of the</font>

840
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:38,940
technology looks like so what this craft

841
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:41,789
is about to introduce a triplet server

842
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:44,609
into the existing authentication

843
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:49,510
procedure in order to push the

844
00:43:44,609 --> 00:43:53,710
standardized protocol so what we going

845
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:55,119
to do is to delegate the functionality

846
00:43:53,710 --> 00:44:00,190
of authentication from the network

847
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:03,400
server to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> grade a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server so we are</font>

848
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:05,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same kind of messages</font>

849
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:09,029
across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the radio what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to do</font>

850
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:11,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">is to introduce new radius attributes</font>

851
00:44:09,029 --> 00:44:14,589
suggest John<font color="#E5E5E5"> request and join</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accept</font>

852
00:44:11,799 --> 00:44:18,130
which are transferred using the radius

853
00:44:14,589 --> 00:44:20,880
protocol to the radius server so the

854
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:25,089
rated server does the job of

855
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:27,970
authenticating and returns the success

856
00:44:25,089 --> 00:44:30,640
or failure message to the radius server

857
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:32,649
sorry to the network server the network

858
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:40,420
server<font color="#CCCCCC"> in turn for us a message</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> N</font>

859
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:41,950
device so so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the few radius</font>

860
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:49,109
attributes which we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

861
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:53,618
introduce through this draft next slide

862
00:44:49,109 --> 00:44:55,058
so the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> status of its draft there</font>

863
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:58,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few modifications in the</font>

864
00:44:55,059 --> 00:45:01,570
introduction part in the section 1 which

865
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:04,360
inches or which emphasizes the

866
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:07,120
importance of the triple a server in

867
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:12,130
this scenario and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> added a reference</font>

868
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:16,060
to RFC 6158 radius design guidelines

869
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:17,890
which specifies the data structures

870
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:22,060
outside which are defined outside the

871
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:27,660
radius and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lp one they had the</font>

872
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:30,700
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group session in co ITF 97</font>

873
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:34,720
though in the current shatter they don't

874
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:37,660
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any specific specification on the</font>

875
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:41,500
radius infrastructure there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a</font>

876
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:45,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of interest from other private or</font>

877
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:49,450
other individual persons and also in one

878
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:51,550
of their<font color="#CCCCCC"> architectural draft they have</font>

879
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:56,950
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> or they have included triple-a</font>

880
00:45:51,550 --> 00:46:02,830
as a part of the architecture so what we

881
00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:04,990
are so what our plan is to keep updating

882
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:08,980
the draft with the inputs from LP<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1</font>

883
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:13,299
group plus the individual individuals

884
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:17,590
and wait for the next charter to be

885
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:20,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">included and also since we use the</font>

886
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:22,810
radius protocol for transport we would

887
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:27,759
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get the inputs from the radix</font>

888
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:30,610
group as well and check if it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

889
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:39,940
useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arabic eyes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are working to</font>

890
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:44,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">clockman yep excellent yep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok oh that's</font>

891
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,310
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one sly bot acknowledgments oh</font>

892
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:53,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok then Mohit so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I understood there</font>

893
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:55,630
is never reject there is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> join</font>

894
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:58,840
request and join except there is no

895
00:46:55,630 --> 00:47:00,910
joint reject yeah yeah there is no joint

896
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,830
reject as of now but if there is a

897
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:06,160
failure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't get any message in the</font>

898
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:10,890
network server so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder what would it</font>

899
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,890
do to the radius like

900
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,840
on the client and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> server side on</font>

901
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:19,070
what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of state machine handling and</font>

902
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:21,200
like how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it affect my</font>

903
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:23,960
implementation my current radius client

904
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:27,890
and server implementation if if there is

905
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:30,830
like if for some reason the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> triple-a</font>

906
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:33,140
server see that this device cannot be

907
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:35,450
authenticated or something is<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong then</font>

908
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:39,799
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> should it send to the network</font>

909
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:42,589
server and like let's open for

910
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:47,920
discussion actually right now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

911
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:50,810
current implementation in go so we don't

912
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:56,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually we have a failure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the in</font>

913
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:58,700
this step on the third step and so we

914
00:47:56,810 --> 00:48:01,910
failed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to generate the network session</font>

915
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:05,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">key and other session Keys maybe we can</font>

916
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:08,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">include a radius reject or access reject</font>

917
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:11,420
in this and like my second<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is</font>

918
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:14,660
more fundamental why do we need new

919
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:17,180
attributes why can't we just put like in

920
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:20,200
the access request access except payload

921
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:22,790
like maybe I'm missing something but

922
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:26,149
like what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so special that needs to be</font>

923
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:28,460
done here<font color="#E5E5E5"> which cannot already be done</font>

924
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:30,620
by putting like things in the payload I

925
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:33,620
mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the join request is a</font>

926
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:36,670
request and you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as a payload in</font>

927
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:41,779
the access request and then whatever

928
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:43,550
things you get back or maybe if you put

929
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:50,240
additional things in the access except

930
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:53,210
maybe then you need new ah my question

931
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:55,910
being is is are<font color="#E5E5E5"> there things that cannot</font>

932
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:58,310
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done by existing messages and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font>

933
00:48:55,910 --> 00:49:02,509
that for which you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need these new</font>

934
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:05,200
attributes the idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple</font>

935
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:07,820
attributes to transfer the complete

936
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:10,879
messages which are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lower for one</font>

937
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:15,620
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the session gives in different</font>

938
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:17,690
attributes so

939
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:19,130
a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> from me then radios always</font>

940
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:22,580
needs attributes to send data<font color="#E5E5E5"> from A to</font>

941
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:25,130
B um as part of the payload so if you

942
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:27,529
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is an attribute which can</font>

943
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:30,830
convey all this data here please let us

944
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:34,070
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'm not not aware of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> generac</font>

945
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:38,779
generally sending a bite screen in any

946
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:40,880
way so that's me i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that attributes</font>

947
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:44,990
are needed that's fun for me as an

948
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:47,510
individual in any case you will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

949
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:50,149
have the excess reject on the red part

950
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:51,440
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conversation in your spec because</font>

951
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:54,260
there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> radius hates more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

952
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">not getting a reply because this simply</font>

953
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:57,290
means maybe the radio service actually

954
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:59,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">dead and i have to ask a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

955
00:49:57,290 --> 00:50:01,340
server and have to fight<font color="#CCCCCC"> over and the</font>

956
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:04,210
ambiguity of non-response is either a

957
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:06,170
reject the organ<font color="#E5E5E5"> i remember in the</font>

958
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:08,870
implementation we have we send the

959
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:10,730
excess reject actually yeah so that part

960
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:12,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">is important if you can do without a</font>

961
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:16,480
negative acknowledgement on the green

962
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:16,480
side of things that's value your thing

963
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:23,380
yeah so when there is this part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

964
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:25,400
blue one with a manufacturer sense

965
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:30,110
enrollment data to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> radius server</font>

966
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:33,440
yeah how this one when it's born during

967
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:36,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">the manufacturing period or we can also</font>

968
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:40,810
use certain management protocols to

969
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:44,960
distribute the keys at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the root keys</font>

970
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:48,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay that's a bit interesting I don't</font>

971
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:51,740
let anybody talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my radius server as</font>

972
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:53,000
a radio said that means greater the

973
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:55,459
radio server does its thing and that's

974
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,920
it so I thought this blue arrow would be

975
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:59,870
like I believe I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said I get a scratch</font>

976
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,780
card with some yeah when it is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> pre</font>

977
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:04,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">configured on the device</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can</font>

978
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:08,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">also manually configure on the radius</font>

979
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:11,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I or but to the device you can</font>

980
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:16,070
use a management protocols tools in the

981
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:18,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece yeah if I sent them to my register</font>

982
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:19,370
that's fine if some manufacturer would

983
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:22,480
be allowed to send something why<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

984
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:22,480
you serve I would be you know

985
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:35,620
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like to ask like a general</font>

986
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:38,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">Alexander Pope a general question to to</font>

987
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:41,589
the group into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room is if there is</font>

988
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:44,740
an interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some point to and to what</font>

989
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:49,780
would be the the chances of getting this

990
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:52,149
document as part of the working group

991
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:54,670
item so of course we'll be publishing

992
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:59,350
this as individual submission for as

993
00:51:54,670 --> 00:52:05,520
long as there is interest but it's how

994
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:08,890
how is there any<font color="#CCCCCC"> interest here and yeah</font>

995
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,270
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it yeah if you ask</font>

996
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:13,600
me up front about how your chances<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

997
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:16,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">there it's a bit difficult but yeah this</font>

998
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:18,580
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that is doing radios for</font>

999
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:21,399
authentication things and that's what we

1000
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:24,520
decide radios for so it's certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1001
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:26,350
out of the line and I think it has

1002
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,940
chances yeah but in the end if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

1003
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:31,120
to have it as a working group item you

1004
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:32,320
have to a call for<font color="#E5E5E5"> adoption and enough</font>

1005
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:34,299
people have to say yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a good</font>

1006
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:37,420
thing to do and whether that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens or</font>

1007
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:46,770
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really um a question of the</font>

1008
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:46,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">future okay thank you</font>

1009
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:02,319
right then we have the last discussion

1010
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:04,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">mm which is then the proxy</font>

1011
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:19,390
considerations documents not talking the

1012
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:22,870
non document so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back so go</font>

1013
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:25,170
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next slide this this comes out of</font>

1014
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:29,290
some discussions with<font color="#CCCCCC"> gin chatted about</font>

1015
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:32,830
practicing in UDP<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp discussions</font>

1016
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:36,040
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> in in Berlin so UDP is required</font>

1017
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:39,160
to retransmit so proxies clients are

1018
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:45,060
required to be transmitted as per RFC

1019
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:48,850
1580 section 2.2 because<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp is reliable</font>

1020
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:52,900
tcp client<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't be transmitted and what</font>

1021
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:54,940
happens with proxies then so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to</font>

1022
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:57,730
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide there should be a very</font>

1023
00:53:54,940 --> 00:54:01,240
simple diagram so let's say there's an

1024
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:03,820
ass which sends data to proxy via UDP so

1025
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:05,649
then as clearly has to retransmit the

1026
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:08,260
proxy then sends things to another<font color="#E5E5E5"> proxy</font>

1027
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:11,190
via<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP clearly this does not read</font>

radius to the home server via UDP in

1030
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:24,130
what does proxy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do now presumably</font>

1031
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:28,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">retransmit but none of the documents</font>

1032
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:35,110
make that clear so to go to the next

1033
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:37,960
slide even<font color="#CCCCCC"> worse RFC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 80 is almost a</font>

1034
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:42,670
decade old and very very few naz's

1035
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:45,370
implemented so that so RC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5080 has a</font>

1036
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:48,910
exponential<font color="#CCCCCC"> back-off for retransmissions</font>

1037
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:50,920
and most as is just do a fixed country

1038
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:54,060
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll be send five packets at</font>

1039
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:57,810
three-second intervals and then get up

1040
00:54:54,060 --> 00:55:00,960
also is the UDP retransmission behavior

1041
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:03,650
optimal and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1042
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:06,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bernard at least was very clear</font>

1043
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:11,830
or that for you TP chains of proxies

1044
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:16,729
each UDP proxy must not retransmit

1045
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:19,940
unless told to do so by re transmission

1046
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:26,690
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mass because this has to end</font>

1047
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:29,090
behavior that might work for routers

1048
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:32,720
it's not clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's the right thing</font>

1049
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:36,830
to do for radius especially once you

1050
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:38,509
have failover and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> these kinds of</font>

1051
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:41,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuffing especially in a complex</font>

1052
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:43,820
environment like<font color="#CCCCCC"> add your own so all</font>

1053
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:47,149
these proxy issues are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> adequate</font>

1054
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:51,440
covered by the existing RFC's so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1055
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:53,450
go to the next slide so what we know is

1056
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,460
the radio servers are relatively smart

1057
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:59,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and can be upgraded easily the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> naz's are</font>

1058
00:55:55,460 --> 00:56:02,060
dumb and they're hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to upgrade for</font>

1059
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:05,480
very good reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> mine loathes upgrade</font>

1060
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:08,509
my switches be clean there's no radius

1061
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:10,850
routing protocol so ideally you don't

1062
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:14,570
need to discover that the upstream

1063
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:17,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">servers down by doing retransmits you</font>

1064
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:19,460
get told by your routing protocol except

1065
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:22,910
we don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> them so all the signaling</font>

1066
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:26,000
has to be real time in band and then the

1067
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:32,569
question is what needs to be done<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1068
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:36,050
and how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it so next slide so I</font>

1069
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:39,770
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we would be useful to have a best</font>

1070
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:42,650
current practices just document covering

1071
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:45,020
proxy considerations but we also need

1072
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:46,400
consensus on what it recommends I think

1073
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:48,980
some things are relatively

1074
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:53,300
straightforward like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the design the</font>

1075
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:55,930
diagram earlier you know if a proxy is

1076
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:59,120
receiving packets over TCP and

1077
00:56:55,930 --> 00:57:01,879
forwarding them over UDP then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> proxy</font>

1078
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:05,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">is responsible for retransmits on the</font>

1079
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:10,160
UDP each side but<font color="#CCCCCC"> another documents say</font>

1080
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:12,890
that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the harder issues are UDP</font>

1081
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:15,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">proxy chains what do they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do I think</font>

1082
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:18,920
most current implementations to

1083
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:22,519
we transmit whatever the upstream

1084
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:26,250
retransmits but there's not a lot of

1085
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:28,259
consensus as to why this is a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

1086
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:30,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think especially when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font>

1087
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:32,880
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> add URL correct me if I'm</font>

1088
00:57:30,839 --> 00:57:39,859
wrong Stefan but most of engine room is

1089
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:43,890
all TLS anyways so next slide and

1090
00:57:39,859 --> 00:57:46,049
discussion do people have opinions on

1091
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:50,069
this other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Bernard who I</font>

1092
00:57:46,049 --> 00:57:55,200
suspect is not in the room I can confirm

1093
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:56,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bernard is not in the room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1094
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,500
before we start with the discussion

1095
00:57:56,910 --> 00:58:03,029
maybe I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to correct human cost you</font>

1096
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:05,519
are wrong turns out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have TLS in</font>

1097
00:58:03,029 --> 00:58:07,440
many countries but that's like 15 to 20

1098
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:11,368
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Jerome is now in 70 countries</font>

1099
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:13,680
worldwide so<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately the typical</font>

1100
00:58:11,369 --> 00:58:15,839
admin even the country level finds it

1101
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,730
easier to provision a UDP shared secret

1102
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:19,828
once and have a tea room for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next 20</font>

1103
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:23,309
years running rather than updating a

1104
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:24,509
certificate every year or so so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1105
00:58:23,309 --> 00:58:26,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">not quite at the point where we say</font>

1106
00:58:24,509 --> 00:58:29,819
everything is TLS this unfortunately

1107
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:35,630
plenty of UDP around so this is this

1108
00:58:29,819 --> 00:58:38,279
perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> basin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to define what the UDP</font>

1109
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:40,829
retransmission that reviewers are and

1110
00:58:38,279 --> 00:58:46,289
why those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> good ideas because right</font>

1111
00:58:40,829 --> 00:58:50,789
now my recollection is that I think

1112
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:53,309
going back to 2865 might be that old or

1113
00:58:50,789 --> 00:58:55,019
maybe maybe a bit later I was having

1114
00:58:53,309 --> 00:58:57,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussions with Bernard about this</font>

1115
00:58:55,019 --> 00:59:00,390
trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things you</font>

1116
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:02,880
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> with which retransmission behavior</font>

1117
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:06,690
was best at Bernard who's very very

1118
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:09,329
insistent that doing um what I'd call

1119
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:11,730
synchronous retransmissions would be

1120
00:59:09,329 --> 00:59:15,619
best where the proxy only retransmits

1121
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:18,859
when signal to to do so by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

1122
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:22,859
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very strong in that opinion but I I</font>

1123
00:59:18,859 --> 00:59:25,348
don't know whether that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than</font>

1124
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:28,339
having a proxy decided you three

1129
00:59:56,310 --> 01:00:04,130
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that edgy Rome</font>

01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:11,250
able to switch over to TCP because you

1133
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:13,500
can do psk even with us<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

1134
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:18,930
have to do certificates unless you want

1135
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:20,820
to do long jumps on which they may still

1136
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:22,350
actually find to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be especially the</font>

1137
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:26,610
country ones may find to be very useful

1138
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:30,660
if they can stop having to support lots

1139
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:37,340
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them but i think</font>

1140
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:39,960
this document is vital for us to do it

1141
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:44,610
is probably really important just for

1142
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:47,640
the pure UDP case we absolutely have to

1143
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:49,620
have this for the UDP<font color="#CCCCCC"> pcp case because</font>

1144
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:51,960
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea what's supposed</font>

1145
01:00:49,620 --> 01:01:00,930
to happen there and everything we

1146
01:00:51,960 --> 01:01:03,270
currently think is probably wrong yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1147
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:04,259
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only echo that bedroom we've been</font>

1148
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:06,900
doing this for more than a decade now

1149
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:12,390
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much like yeah it works</font>

1150
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:14,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">sawed off and that's it but nobody</font>

1151
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:16,200
really has has any good answers so far

1152
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:18,089
if we can find them that's great

1153
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,730
question is do we find<font color="#CCCCCC"> an answer that</font>

1154
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:22,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually fixes all kinds of proxy</font>

1155
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:26,040
problems or or is the best thing we can

1156
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:27,330
do is document them but it has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1157
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:31,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that somebody has to think about it then</font>

1158
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:31,100
has to put it in writing yet

1159
01:01:35,550 --> 01:02:02,550
oh hey nobody else at the mic so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess</font>

1160
01:01:42,450 --> 01:02:04,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's it goodbye Alan oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

1161
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:07,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">was it for the individual rough draft</font>

1162
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:09,510
discussions um so if one of the office

1163
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,859
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these documents say is ok I've got a</font>

1164
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:13,080
draft i want this adopted as a working

1165
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:15,870
group item please contact the chairs or

1166
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:17,430
just talk on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mailing list and we run</font>

1167
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:18,750
call for adoptions of those I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1168
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:23,069
there's plenty of interesting stuff here

1169
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:25,260
that radix could be working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on um but</font>

1170
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:27,270
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's it for today then so all</font>

1171
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:28,770
I can do is have a wrap up here there is

1172
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:30,450
this footnote about taste actually

1173
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:33,300
wanted to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this eep identity</font>

1174
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:36,779
response<font color="#CCCCCC"> raft mm-hmm so I didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

1175
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:38,250
the time to update that one I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

1176
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:41,340
we took away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous</font>

1177
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:43,620
discussions is that the basic premise

1178
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:45,060
that this draft is starting from namely

1179
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:47,160
that you could be in a situation where

1180
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:49,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have to do have multiple identities</font>

1181
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:52,109
to choose from and you don't know which

1182
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:54,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">one to choose is that everybody said</font>

1183
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:55,800
well it shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like that you</font>

1184
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:58,730
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have exactly one choice</font>

1185
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:01,080
how to authenticate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 given</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

1186
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:03,450
that I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be nice</font>

1187
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,710
it's been the world so far that

1188
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:06,509
especially if you take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

1189
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:10,050
Wi-Fi<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alliance past point past point</font>

1190
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:12,600
things there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a sequence of events</font>

1191
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:14,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> where this gone wrong is certainly</font>

1192
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:16,620
possible so it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you do end</font>

1193
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:20,490
up in this situation the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason being</font>

1194
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:22,140
that any network is not necessarily one

1195
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:24,689
network so you can't have an access

1196
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:26,460
point with one SSID advertising that you

1197
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:28,770
can connect to it with a multitude<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1198
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:31,170
identities and if you're particularly

1199
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:32,790
unlucky that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have identities with</font>

1200
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:35,040
more than one provider which are all

1201
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:38,340
compatible with this access point you do

1202
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:40,310
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that choice so I will rephrase the</font>

1203
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:43,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">document to point in the direction that</font>

1204
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:44,650
you only have to read this if things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1205
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:46,510
really wrong

1206
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:51,240
you've got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it right at some point</font>

1207
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:52,990
um but that's basically it so I

1208
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:58,899
certainly hope to have an update before

1209
01:03:52,990 --> 01:04:13,618
the next 90 °f and then that's it from

1210
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:13,619
this document so anybody any<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we are</font>

1211
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">here</font>

1212
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:28,980
different person anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tomorrow</font>

1213
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:38,420
