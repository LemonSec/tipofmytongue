by getting Reverend rescorla to explain

talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a lawyer might be a little</font>

68
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,669
bit better if you actually wanted legal

on the screen<font color="#CCCCCC"> so right now we're going</font>

77
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let Martin who's editing the text of</font>

78
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,080
this on the basis of the suggestion

79
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:41,490
that's already been discussed in the

80
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:43,349
list from Alyssa but you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

81
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,950
wondering why we're subjecting you to a

82
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:49,080
live editing session the chair is really

83
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:53,010
felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we wanted to get discussion</font>

84
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,390
here real-time high bandwidth so that

85
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:57,330
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go back to the list we can</font>

86
00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:00,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">report that that occurred we do not want</font>

87
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:04,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have this come back as a document in</font>

88
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:07,940
Chicago you want the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PR accepted and us</font>

89
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:11,000
ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move on so this document can go</font>

90
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:13,350
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> j sep and with security documents</font>

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,960
in particular because we think without

92
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:19,620
it the security abs will immediately go

93
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:23,099
there's a piece missing to your security

94
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,430
considerations please add same so

95
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:29,480
while Martin is live editing I will

96
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:34,160
remind you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the overview draft</font>

97
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:36,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">Herald also among the missing I should</font>

98
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:58,590
let me update this to be a picture of

99
00:06:36,570 --> 00:07:02,969
Harold here for a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's</font>

100
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:06,510
Harold we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

101
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:08,940
each missing person so he<font color="#CCCCCC"> has revved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

102
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:11,460
overview document and that the key

103
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,140
question here is it had been a normative

104
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,150
reference for a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

105
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,190
and so a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things are stuck</font>

106
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:24,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the artsy editors queue waiting for</font>

107
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:26,340
it to be public not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them so some</font>

108
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,659
of them will actually pop out once

109
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,340
overview is published so we wish to

110
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,490
change theory which had been that we

111
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,690
published overview last and say hey at

112
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,630
this point we're not going to change

113
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:39,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything at the overview level so we</font>

114
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:42,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to go ahead and publish it is there</font>

115
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:44,730
anybody who has an objection okay then

116
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,489
you can expect a working group last call

117
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:59,520
on that as soon as Shawn's tiny little

118
00:07:47,490 --> 00:08:02,760
fingers can go uh beat I'm sorry to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

119
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,320
list ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will pop it into an emacs</font>

120
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:08,190
buffer and get it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in just a second</font>

121
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:10,230
the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ecker did you</font>

127
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:29,760
case of life to the security draft we

128
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:31,800
intend to seek active review of it and

129
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,229
security architecture again we have done

130
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,479
this twice so far but the last time was

131
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:41,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">Headley over a year ago</font>

132
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:43,349
as time has passed on us but we also

133
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:46,139
intend to bring this to working group

134
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:48,630
last call shortly after the beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

154
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:58,020
do this in slides actually because this

155
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,690
is big enough that if I do it in a

156

single scrolling<font color="#E5E5E5"> Emacs buffer it's gonna</font>

getting a pink box up on it yeah so

163
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:24,189
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> mark Nottingham all I did here</font>

164
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:26,569
was exactly what i described on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list</font>

165
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,790
with one minor tweak to the sentence

166
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:32,870
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I moved this block up I did not</font>

167
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:34,160
touch mode 1 mode to know 30 mode for

168
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,860
all of that description I just copy

169
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,010
paste so that's literally from the

170
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">latest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> version of the draft from the</font>

171
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:44,450
website now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's wrong and there's</font>

172
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,760
another version in github you know too

173
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:49,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">bad um no I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I scan this and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

174
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:52,220
one on the website<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the one in github</font>

175
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:54,680
are in sync I said that there isn't

176
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,940
there is no draft in github otherwise

177
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,660
this would have been in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the form of a</font>

178
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:02,060
pull request and that's kind of annoying

179
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:04,189
this actually isn't github I can send

180
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,069
you I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find it I couldn't find</font>

181
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:09,440
it I can send a poor requested if if I

182
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:13,790
get a location I will send it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Ray</font>

183
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:16,070
after this meeting thanks Justin so the

184
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,530
the change here is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just rewrote</font>

185
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:22,010
this paragraph after the end I took

186
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:24,290
Alice's text with the amendment that

187
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:28,040
echo requested and I put it immediately

188
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:30,500
after that and then I took the rationale

189
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:33,349
that we had previously<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you scroll</font>

190
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:37,160
down a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> further you will see</font>

191
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:39,380
the rationale that would that that's the

192
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,719
app that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's where how and the other</font>

193
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:47,570
down down down down down down down down

194
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:49,310
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna so the main ideas for the</font>

195
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,500
design are the following I

196
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:54,229
deleted the one that I've moved up so

197
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,840
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the RTC web mailing list</font>

198
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,890
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> Center just a few moments ago so</font>

199
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,480
if you wish to look at on your own

200
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,220
screen please<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring up the mailing list</font>

201
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,080
text and you can read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it there so this</font>

202
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the restructuring we need to change</font>

203
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:09,529
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gathering all possible candidates to</font>

204
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:14,810
fix bug but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes that possible so</font>

205
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:16,850
gathering candidates at a mode not that

206
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:23,630
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is less privacy preserving than the</font>

207
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:29,630
that's that's the that I didn't get this

208
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:34,790
copy paste copy paste copy paste yes

209
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:37,910
that section so I i I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just copying</font>

210
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:39,650
pasting text so but so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is</font>

211
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,600
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> microphones and it's Justin's</font>

212
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:44,089
here yeah i'm using the microphone that

213
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,760
the first paragraph that the thing under

214
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:48,320
node one says you can only use node<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

215
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,640
when you get some for local media access

216
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,440
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> on which I thought was not we</font>

217
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,150
agreed on the other conditions about

218
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,270
what when you actually be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

219
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:12,040
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have load one alright so i</font>

220
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:16,040
confess that i was doing this lives and

221
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:18,199
I mean my point is that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font>

222
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,120
gather the design ideas this gathering

223
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,250
our planet is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> section that the</font>

224
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,870
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only things out ended</font>

225
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,780
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the screen gathering all possible</font>

226
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:29,540
candidates blah is that not is that

227
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:35,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft or not yeah okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

228
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:37,610
right so so the I mean let me try to

229
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:40,819
reduce yeah I guess I I mean so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

230
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:42,440
seems to me to contradict like let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

231
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:45,110
take a step back which is forgetting

232
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:48,589
about the text i think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> either</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

233
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:52,100
hatch is supposed to say is that you can

234
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:54,200
only do mode<font color="#E5E5E5"> one if you gain some form</font>

235
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,150
of user consent that that is that is

236
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,380
what census we have good<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's</font>

237
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,089
what I thought this supposed to say i do

238
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">not believe this text managed to say</font>

239
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:02,840
that although they should say several oh

240
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,490
it's sort of half does

241
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:08,030
and half<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't right so says it there</font>

242
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:09,440
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then but then oh sorry and and that</font>

243
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:12,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the former user consent is left up that</font>

244
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,610
is left up to the browser however we

245
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,260
suggest you that perhaps one way of

246
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,030
retaining user consent would be to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

247
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,950
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera microphone is that like</font>

248
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,990
that's essentially well yeah that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

249
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,970
text that you can see on<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen but not</font>

250
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,590
in the text from node 1 itself which is

251
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,270
your point is that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your concern</font>

252
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:32,750
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess I guess what I would say</font>

253
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:34,610
is that um I guess is yes but also I

254
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,430
think that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we agree on that</font>

255
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:41,060
substantive material then in the section

256
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:43,430
which you've highlighted like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

257
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:45,199
would remove the sentence starting with

258
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,390
gathering all possible candidates up to

259
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,920
the semicolon because that just creates

260
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,030
confusion respective knows what if we

261
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,089
respect to the statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the previous</font>

262
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:55,189
paragraph that is this the previous

263
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:58,510
poultry and then and then and then you

264
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:02,840
say this swartz and it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I basically</font>

265
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:04,700
like take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the take the stuff after the</font>

266
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,040
semicolon stuff it after the first

267
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,200
sentence in in the fruit of the previous

268
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,150
paragraph and then you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

269
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:15,860
something is coherent thank you that

270
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:18,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me all right let me see I</font>

271
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:21,560
can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> namely but no one must ah</font>

272
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:23,030
pues dr. user consent piss semicolon

273
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,160
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> swartz the typical blah blah blah</font>

274
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:29,120
finish that paragraph and then stuff on

275
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:33,560
the end where it says motu yep gotcha<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

276
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,960
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> also remove the section that the</font>

277
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,540
sentences in mode 1 the definition<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

278
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,950
mode one that says as such this should

279
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,099
only be formed when the user explicitly

280
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:45,110
is given consent it mentions the design

281
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,420
rational number<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> above which will</font>

282
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,400
now be below and we don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to repeat</font>

283
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,589
ourselves so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to cut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

284
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,709
i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send that to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the list okay</font>

285
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:57,500
well i think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think the</font>

286
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:59,390
actual positioning of the rationale

287
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:03,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">verses on roads like we can probably</font>

288
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:05,839
discuss that some other than work<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font>

289
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:08,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">mailing list I guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seems like in a lot</font>

290
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,310
like editorial of like you throw

291
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:12,050
something and then provide rationale for

292
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,940
or do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of explain the rationale</font>

293
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:16,639
and then you know sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of indicate what</font>

294
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:18,350
falls out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that design idea</font>

295
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,550
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the main thing is like what</font>

296
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:21,020
are the actual required on some we

297
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:24,829
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clear about that leading</font>

298
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:26,119
this meeting all right so I tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cut</font>

299
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:31,490
and paste what I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ecker was</font>

300
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:34,790
saying did I get it right yes yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

301
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:36,470
that that is also what i just sent it go

302
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:42,310
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to mode</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the description of mode 1</font>

303
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:47,360
above delete from as such<font color="#E5E5E5"> onwards</font>

304
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:53,560
because that that is covered<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the</font>

305
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,560
stuff we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just added delete that yes yes</font>

306
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:04,220
Magnus in the last graph of mode to the

307
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:06,400
sins mode to what instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying when</font>

308
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,600
local media access is not granted say

309
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:13,240
when consents has not been obtained

310
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,240
earth yep yeah when consent has granted

311
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:29,350
yeah let's let's let's make sure that we

312
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,350
use user rather than consent generally

313
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:51,440
done is there another above I yeah I

314
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,150
think we can walk or a deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font>

315
00:18:51,440 --> 00:19:00,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually know what gets off name is do</font>

316
00:18:53,150 --> 00:19:07,130
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a definition for that it's</font>

317
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:09,740
referenced up in the see it the second

318
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:12,170
well the second bullet other ideas for

319
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:17,210
design which are now below rather than

320
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:19,090
above ah problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so if we knew</font>

321
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,770
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rationale above does that actually</font>

322
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:25,220
just change this from<font color="#E5E5E5"> above to balloon</font>

323
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:26,629
well I I fee like this guy editorial

324
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,440
stuff you just probably not best done in

325
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:31,930
a pond or a boy

326
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:34,360
yeah I only<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want this to be hummed</font>

327
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:36,220
today so it might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be best done in a</font>

328
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,800
plenary form but that's what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

329
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,660
do that's what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing Magnus you've</font>

330
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,669
been standing patiently for a long time

331
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:48,490
yes because my issue isn't around

332
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:50,950
exactly i looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> ml4 and i assume</font>

333
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,290
this actually includes turn relays but

334
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:56,770
it's maybe should be slightly more

335
00:19:53,290 --> 00:20:00,280
explicit about enumerated so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

336
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:03,900
explicit about that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to stun</font>

337
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,899
relays because they different things

338
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:12,550
that actually is discussed in the

339
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:17,100
section after the modes are defined<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

340
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:20,350
yeah so the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of proxies is</font>

341
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:22,689
important to get right<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as Justin</font>

342
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:25,030
points out that's later on because we

343
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:27,430
don't want to say turn relay because if

344
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:30,389
that's application provided tone really

345
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:41,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we get it back into the soup so I</font>

346
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:44,230
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably okay so are there</font>

347
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:49,030
any other changes to this text that

348
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:51,310
people want now and and Martin I

349
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:54,250
understand you've sent the replacement

350
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:55,750
text to the list as well if you've met a

351
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:58,960
few tweaks since I did that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

352
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:01,560
center sure let's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through it</font>

353
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,560
carefully

354
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:12,550
above is still wrong but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put him star</font>

355
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:22,810
star star next to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we can just</font>

356
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:44,770
mark that as to be fixed I'm ready next

357
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:48,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">page please young lovers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right let's</font>

358
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:52,180
let's not do a hum in this room but we

359
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,830
can decide now I think everyone read

360
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,600
this you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that the the</font>

361
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:58,060
tail end of this is still correct so a

362
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,449
Magnus has asked for another moment for

363
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,450
this page

364
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,740
so none of this

365
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,629
text is really subtly changed right oh

366
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:39,010
I've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you'll notice it's it it</font>

367
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:40,630
goes from two to four explore but let us

368
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:43,780
assume that the editors will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

369
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:49,059
translate this into whatever format is

370
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:53,920
most appropriate this can be crammed

371
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:55,330
down that's what we're saying does

372
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:06,640
anybody still need to be on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this or can</font>

373
00:22:55,330 --> 00:23:08,230
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish moving down yep Justin I just</font>

374
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to note for you that we actually</font>

375
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:14,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't do what's in one we do to first</font>

376
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:17,290
and then bind specifically to the IP

377
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,480
address rediscover into um and that's

378
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,950
fine I i think you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can relax and</font>

379
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,570
language to make it less normative and

380
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:25,270
say you know for example or something

381
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:26,919
like that yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't think this</font>

382
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,270
forbid what we did I just wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

383
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,120
for you that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not weird yeah well one</font>

384
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:32,080
of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I need two starters</font>

385
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,449
what a pending update to this document

386
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">is replaced in this language with actual</font>

387
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:39,850
must should requirements strength floors

388
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:41,950
and I'll just make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

389
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:46,409
marked without any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of normative</font>

390
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,410
language thank you

391
00:23:53,950 --> 00:24:15,320
is there really ready to move the next

392
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:16,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">page ok so in graph for on this I don't</font>

393
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,110
know problem with this text but Justin

394
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:22,189
you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to want to note that this</font>

00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:59,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">find you I find nitpicking easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to read</font>

401
00:24:47,600 --> 00:25:02,030
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm satisfied with this talks do we</font>

402
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:07,210
still mention chrome in this document

403
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:10,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">for leaves so now that weapon roughly</font>

404
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:13,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I made a mistake of copying the old</font>

405
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">text that's fine</font>

406
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:26,129
so my name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is wisdom so the intention of</font>

407
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,799
oops number just for<font color="#CCCCCC"> hair is to say if</font>

408
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:30,929
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if if using web proxy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also for</font>

409
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">your web traffic towards the server</font>

410
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:35,390
that's the try what you trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

411
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:38,760
determine and then you're in this

412
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:48,240
consideration or what this is it just

413
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:49,650
the immediate path traffic so it's is it

414
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,500
the communication with the with the

415
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:58,590
radiant server or is it the WebRTC media

416
00:25:54,500 --> 00:26:01,620
traffic tits proxied so the intent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

417
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:03,600
the text as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand it is to say if</font>

418
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:06,809
the user is using a proxy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

419
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,928
purposes and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> parenthesis for the</font>

420
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:15,389
purposes<font color="#CCCCCC"> of anonymizing their traffic by</font>

421
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:17,039
passing it through that proxy then even

422
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:19,880
determining that the proxy is in place

423
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,020
yeah it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of challenging yeah and</font>

424
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,510
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are when you do finally</font>

425
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,668
determine that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the proxy</font>

426
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:34,020
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> WebRTC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're kind of forced to use</font>

427
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:37,230
TCP and that kind of sucks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

428
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:39,270
now going to do things that you unless

429
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:42,870
you have your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn server also bound</font>

430
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:47,840
by on the it's it's not trustable that's

431
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:47,840
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have the return thing hanky yep I</font>

432
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:54,050
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that takes</font>

433
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:57,740
does everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it needs to say in</font>

434
00:26:54,050 --> 00:27:00,470
that regard it's just when we could

435
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:02,600
write the entire essay on why it is why

436
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:05,840
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is enough for the</font>

437
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:09,439
document<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alan port but I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very confused</font>

438
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,629
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> how this relates to the difference</font>

439
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,480
between three and four before the mode

440
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:17,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">three forces to return server mode for</font>

441
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:21,890
said proxy but then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is talking</font>

442
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:24,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">about proxies and turn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP turn but</font>

443
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:27,380
please be turning the same text so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

444
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:32,500
mode for talking about TCP turn in the

445
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:32,500
previous one rather than HTTP proxies

446
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:44,720
yeah so so mode for is talking about

447
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:51,379
proxies period which which encompasses

448
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:53,750
both web<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP proxies and or the return</font>

449
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:55,850
stuff do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that more</font>

450
00:27:53,750 --> 00:28:00,950
explicit I think so yeah that'd be

451
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:02,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">helpful and it may be a socks proxy it</font>

452
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:09,890
does mention<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyclic Roxy's explicitly</font>

453
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:11,809
there hey exactly if<font color="#E5E5E5"> he mentioned return</font>

454
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:16,940
I think it would cover off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

455
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:18,920
the all the bases so no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it needs</font>

456
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:21,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be a little more expert I think I</font>

457
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:34,450
think what we really need here is a

458
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:35,740
definition<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what proxy is John thanks</font>

459
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:38,710
the other point here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

460
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:40,180
something which is browser configured

461
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:42,550
that application configured it's the

462
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:44,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">point this is correct yeah and that's</font>

463
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,790
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> critical point it's that</font>

464
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,169
I think we're going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

465
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,540
definition<font color="#CCCCCC"> of proxies it probably needs</font>

466
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:50,770
to happen in section 2 where it sort of

467
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:54,389
states the problem for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first time</font>

468
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,389
and it talks about proxies in place

469
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:01,890
sounds like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan should we are that as</font>

470
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,090
an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> and treat that as editorial</font>

471
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:05,470
well I'm sort of hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we would</font>

472
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:13,659
basically open issues and all these

473
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:15,190
things here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> well if we get a PR from</font>

474
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">Martin that covers the conversation</font>

475
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:20,800
today I don't think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to split it</font>

476
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,640
into multiple issues just because you

477
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,159
know they were there were raised

478
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:29,050
separately I think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can contribute as</font>

479
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:30,970
a and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single PR for for all of the the</font>

480
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:33,340
text we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so far the the</font>

481
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:34,690
definition of proxy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I agree is if it</font>

482
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,610
goes in section 2 would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a different</font>

483
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,620
PR and probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> that does not mine</font>

484
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:40,719
editing the pr here should really

485
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:43,110
concentrate on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what specific words in to</font>

486
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:48,940
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the definition of the modes and</font>

487
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:51,850
the depth a blogger so that this is yeah

488
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:52,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry Justin this this paragraph that we</font>

489
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:55,449
have at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom of the screen is the</font>

490
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,040
critical one we should keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on the</font>

491
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:59,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">screen while people contemplate whether</font>

492
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,790
they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that we are happy with</font>

493
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:04,120
this or not because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just</font>

494
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:06,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">reached that point right i think you</font>

495
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,340
know in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular paragraph i</font>

496
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:12,040
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the last sentence probably</font>

497
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:15,760
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be altered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit to</font>

498
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:18,610
refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to consent you know in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other words</font>

499
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:24,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if consent is not obtained</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IE the</font>

500
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:24,060
default case then mode<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 should be used</font>

501
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:30,490
right so you mean to say if consent does

502
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:33,130
not obtain user agent should use mode to

503
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:37,120
that they might choose a center policy

504
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:38,620
in certain circumstance and about that

505
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,169
and then we're saying this you know use

506
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:43,929
this by default here which<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think you</font>

507
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:47,309
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't typing feel sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm john</font>

508
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:49,860
is fine I know probably change

509
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:52,980
actually change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so I think the</font>

510
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:57,689
words we're looking for and unless user

511
00:30:52,980 --> 00:31:01,289
consent is obtained user agents should

512
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:02,879
use mode<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we pull this back so i</font>

513
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:11,158
can actually seen it<font color="#E5E5E5"> see this for a</font>

514
00:31:02,879 --> 00:31:15,769
second so you wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say unless</font>

515
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:21,929
unless user consent has been obtained

516
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:35,789
user agents should use mode 2 and then

517
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:43,860
though they may that's good call<font color="#E5E5E5"> Justin</font>

518
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:50,570
that makes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> better it's got other</font>

519
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:50,570
stuff on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you want to seize email</font>

520
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,120
does anyone

521
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:18,780
to get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the microphone to speak</font>

522
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:21,780
against this proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

523
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:27,780
mechanically what will happen now is the

524
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:29,760
PRS will get filed by yes yes I'll send

525
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">us back to Martin he'll file file a PR</font>

526
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:37,920
against the repo which Justin will

527
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:40,380
disclose and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

528
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:42,420
list with the PR for<font color="#CCCCCC"> for review on the</font>

529
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:45,000
list but my understanding is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody</font>

530
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:48,180
in this room currently objects other<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

535
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:13,200
taker<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the plan Harold by the way</font>

536
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:15,270
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arrived we agreed that people</font>

were ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take over view into</font>

538
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:20,690
publication so we will be starting a

00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:20,690
working group last call on it just FYI

540
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:29,670
that closes the business of WebRTC RTC

541

web for as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am aware unless</font>

there is somebody who wishes to get up

00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:40,620
to the mic and decide they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

something else seeing none thank you all
