52
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,070

57
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:12,900
and I here to present you the last

58
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:21,300
status of the draft called<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC 4960</font>

59
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:24,299
rotten issues so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the idea</font>

60
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,240
of this draft is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are describing</font>

61
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:31,370
issues found since<font color="#CCCCCC"> the publication of</font>

62
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:36,990
RFC 4960 which is the specification of

63
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:39,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">sctp we describe issues solutions for</font>

64
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:44,700
them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly extra we want to</font>

65
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:47,510
address them in the second draft RFC

66
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:55,500
4960 be so this draft is kind of

67
00:07:47,510 --> 00:08:00,930
prerequisite for this document so what

68
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:04,080
what actually happens inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> EF 96 yet</font>

69
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:07,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">first of all the draft was adopted as a</font>

70
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:11,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">workgroup draft and we published a</font>

71
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:17,550
document with a slightly different name

72
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:24,900
the current revision is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0-1 and it</font>

73
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:30,660
already addresses 40 issues since I TF

74
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:36,030
96 we describe six new issues and in our

75
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:38,400
list we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently 14 open issues</font>

76
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:42,449
but i think that nine<font color="#E5E5E5"> or 10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

77
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:46,260
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually addressed yeah we use</font>

78
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:49,460
issue tracker and in github so all holy

79
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:53,160
issues all revisions of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft and</font>

80
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:58,940
some of the discussions are there it's

81
00:08:53,160 --> 00:09:03,579
public and anyone can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> then publish</font>

82
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:06,610
issues so what what we see

83
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:08,110
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is yeah we we still have</font>

84
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:13,090
remaining issues and we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font>

85
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:17,920
them if there are some new issues we

86
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:20,860
will work on them actually we have some

87
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,160
issues some external issues I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

88
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:28,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">only published by coffers of this draft</font>

89
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:32,560
so anyone is welcome to publish issues

90
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:35,410
and video look at them and we also want

91
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,229
to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> feedback on this draft because</font>

92
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:42,189
now it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group draft to be we</font>

93
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:44,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">want some reviews and yeah we will</font>

94
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:50,290
appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> if if you send us comments on</font>

95
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:53,110
this draft yeah that's basically what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

96
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:55,750
wanted to say let's see so are any of

97
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:58,060
the issues significant and likely to

98
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:01,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">require attention by the working group</font>

99
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,310
or is are these turning out to be issues

100
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,990
that the author team that knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> sctp</font>

101
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,270
well can work through and<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposed</font>

102
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:11,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">regional resolutions for well majority</font>

103
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:14,069
of the issues are clarifications or some

104
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,290
editorial stuff or removal some

105
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:19,420
inconsistent things but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ram drive</font>

106
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,790
few technical issues so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

107
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,550
that it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really good if if you</font>

108
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,680
look at this document and and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing</font>

109
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:29,079
else bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> open technical issues to the</font>

110
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,930
meeting the meet the meeting in<font color="#CCCCCC"> chicago</font>

111
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,640
I think we basically decided that this

112
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,500
dress going to need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to meeting cycles</font>

113
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,260
arm that were probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be</font>

114
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">done with it until the August meet until</font>

115
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,350
the second meeting next year I'm looking

116
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,400
one of the ad she probably knows where

117
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:47,980
it is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I because I don't remember</font>

118
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:52,090
what we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> after Chicago okay okay</font>

119
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,920
so anybody's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interests sctp please read</font>

120
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,840
this draft this is a kind of nitpicking

121
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,099
details that necessarily get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

122
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:02,380
implementations right make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

123
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:05,830
work together any questions for max I'm

124
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:08,260
Sergeant<font color="#E5E5E5"> maximexi you care yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just to</font>

125
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:10,810
know that we have a few reviewers and in

126
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:15,130
some some offline discussions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

127
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:17,170
think that at least we know three names

128
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,540
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> volunteer to</font>

129
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:22,599
yeah we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're noticing the usual</font>

130
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:28,029
suspects are<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very much</font>

00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:08,290
name to become a working group draft so

146
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,300
we don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run an adoption call on</font>

147
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:14,139
it but we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be looking for people</font>

148
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:16,449
please read this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this lower</font>

149
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:18,970
effort service also known as scavenger

150
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:21,040
or less than best effort is becoming

151
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,680
something that people increasingly like

152
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,180
to see and diffserv and that draft is

153
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,040
going to be the vehicle for actually

154
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,140
specifying it in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fashion that we think</font>

155
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,490
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use so i apologize for goofing</font>

156
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,069
that but the good news is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have one</font>

157
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:35,110
less adoption called run on the list

158
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:38,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay Randy and that would luck that</font>

159
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,750
remote works<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so stream scheduler</font>

160
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:44,579
and user interface in are leaving for

161
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:47,019
sctp basically we've had a few minor

162
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:50,890
clarifications that gory had us put in

163
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:51,880
there's been no technical changes as far

164
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">as we're concerned it's ready</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

165
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,769
working last call um so you can start

166
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,930
that after the meeting maybe yeah we

167
00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:02,079
probably will because this draft has the

168
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:06,880
dubious honor of being the last gbg

169
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:09,310
draft in the in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> web RTC hairball or</font>

170
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,529
tar ball or<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever you call it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

171
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,689
not like to be last<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft standing in</font>

172
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:18,040
that one so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will probably last call</font>

173
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:21,180
it to uh in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the NFL in your future with</font>

174
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,170
the goal getting that out of here and

175
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,239
getting out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the way of what it was</font>

176
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,719
going to happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> web RTC as far as</font>

177
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,010
implementation status we have there's a

178
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,670
simulation on yet that has it in it as

179
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,860
well as

180
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,870
previous d stack which is also all in

181
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:38,290
the user space has this code in it it's

182
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">working so it's at we kind of move slow</font>

183
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,969
because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do code for</font>

184
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,290
everything so it but it gets there

185
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:48,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's so nice have stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> works</font>

186
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:51,880
yeah that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always a good idea next</font>

187
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:54,369
draft is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAT support this has been</font>

188
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,430
around for a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time there haven't</font>

189
00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:00,700
been any changes since the last IETF

190
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:02,380
there's a it sounds like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Michael</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has AV</font>

191
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,510
box implementation you started there is

192
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,270
actually a previous implementation in

193
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,600
previous d of this of a past version of

194
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:12,970
this draft that's been out in the

195
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,920
firewall / nat of previously for quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

196
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:18,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">while on the menus of updates i'm not</font>

197
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:21,459
sure there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> still some things to do I</font>

198
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,270
think this this draft split and merged

199
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,920
and merged and split and in the process

200
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:28,449
some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> text need to be shuffled</font>

201
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,640
around so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have NAT</font>

202
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,770
implementation points and endpoint

203
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,560
implementation points all in correct

204
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:38,439
places and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some</font>

205
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:41,109
issues with covering the ipv4 26 and

206
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,720
vice versa translation but there are all

207
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:46,180
things to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this one we're</font>

208
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">hoping we talked about Skye's schedule</font>

209
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,719
yesterday hoping that this will move

210
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:53,219
with an index meeting cycle will be

211
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:56,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wittenberg last call resolved</font>

213
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">have no word okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask a</font>

214
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:04,300
tangentially related question there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

215
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:07,300
carrier-grade NAT yang draft looking for

00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:11,050
a home raise your hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font>

217
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,280
familiar with how Nats work keep it up

218
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:16,930
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you understand</font>

219
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:20,439
carrier-grade Nats all right we aren't

220
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:27,130
completely clueless but Spencer I think

221
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:30,610
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some useful information final</font>

222
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:33,160
sctp draft is UDP encapsulation of

223
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:36,400
street sctp packets on additional

224
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,709
considerations there have many changes

225
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,380
here explicitly describes handling of

226
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:43,360
embedded addresses and it's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ax and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

227
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,140
transformed<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it's going to transform</font>

228
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,200
into

229
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:49,660
69 51 bits which is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> original UDP</font>

230
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:53,410
encapsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> graph</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this will</font>

231
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:55,420
turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> into of 69 51 bits when copies</font>

232
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:57,850
spare time surfaces I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Michael</font>

233
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,380
yeah and at that point we'll run working

234
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:02,530
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> read-option on it let's play on this</font>

235
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:05,080
/ prog that's were going after Chicago

236
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,339
yes saw at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Prague yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's none</font>

237
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that sounds it sounds like sounds</font>

238
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a reasonable time and there's</font>

239
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,700
enough changes here that it really

240
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:16,199
should be abyss as opposed to and on an

241
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:19,810
update correction stock yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how</font>

242
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:22,990
important is what's being done here to

243
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:24,810
web RTC he says not shirring not being

244
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:29,860
sure he wants to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer well</font>

245
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:32,079
they use the UDP encapsulation yes and

246
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,460
it's it simple you<font color="#CCCCCC"> DP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and calculations</font>

247
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,010
implemented<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's out there it's</font>

248
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,600
implemented this the draft chant are the

249
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:48,610
best changing doesn't affect the

250
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:51,060
implementation at all thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got</font>

251
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,060
even bigger

252
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:06,329
okay all right anybody have any

253
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:15,530
questions or<font color="#CCCCCC"> comments on the sctp piece</font>

254
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:18,300
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda all right I get to try to</font>

255
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:27,389
impersonate Joe touch let's see if I can

256
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:28,680
do that so Joe's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on this</font>

257
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:32,100
raft for a while I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe it's been</font>

258
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:38,190
presented here in uh in TS VW g in the

259
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:43,080
past this is about a option space for

260
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:45,060
UDP and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> being done by taking</font>

261
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,100
advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the fact in a UDP packet</font>

262
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:50,129
there are two links which currently

263
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,689
supposed to match namely the IP UDP

264
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,500
length of both suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> describe the same</font>

265
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:58,200
package it is possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to adjust them so</font>

266
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:02,820
they don't and there's a little bit of

267
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:06,000
IP packet hiding behind the end of the

268
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:11,250
UDP payload and what Joe is looking at

269
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:17,280
here is to in essence use that as some

270
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:19,890
as some UDP option space it appears<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

271
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,590
work with implementations there's a

272
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,940
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff down at the bottom</font>

273
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:32,040
indicating the kinds of things one might

274
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:38,070
use UDP options for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok um new version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

275
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:39,990
this coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon interesting idea of</font>

276
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,450
hiding you to be optioned down there

277
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:45,210
that'll make you<font color="#CCCCCC"> DP behave like UDP</font>

278
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:47,310
light but use the UDP port that's been

279
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">them sorry use the UDP protocol number</font>

280
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:52,200
that's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a major obstacle to UDP</font>

281
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:56,880
light deployment that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not use the</font>

282
00:18:52,200 --> 00:19:01,560
same protocol number as up as UDP he's

283
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:04,770
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> some implementation code and there's</font>

284
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:08,540
a request for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group to pick</font>

285
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,540
this up as a

286
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:16,410
as a draft I'm a little cautious about

287
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:22,440
this one how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have read this</font>

288
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:24,630
draft um or read a read read the 03

289
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,860
version ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> fours way raise your hand if</font>

290
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:31,200
you've read this draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see two people</font>

291
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,510
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not enough to run a Hummer run</font>

292
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,400
run run a hum in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll take</font>

293
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">care of the op will take care of this on</font>

294
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,200
the list and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lori's is coming</font>

295
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:43,860
maybe tell us it's a bad idea or no

296
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,950
actually last I heard so I haven't

297
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:50,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">really paid much attention to this um I</font>

298
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:52,080
has any data been shown about how well

299
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,390
it works on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet any measurement</font>

300
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,429
data because if it actually did work

301
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,040
widely I think I would be very cool and

302
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:01,470
would be a pretty strong argument for

303
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:04,440
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> it please ask that question on</font>

304
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,810
the list<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay cuz Joe put on this slide</font>

305
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,730
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like new he's read his words</font>

306
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:10,620
compared with<font color="#E5E5E5"> legacy so far so clearly</font>

307
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,720
he's got some running code that does

308
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,310
something in some environment but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

310
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,490
right

311
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:32,780
any other question media yeah I could

312
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,280
even I find it you dip you like this

313
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,410
case pretty interesting actually I would

314
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,760
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know our leap like to hear</font>

315
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:47,720
anybody's interested in actually

316
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:51,379
adopting that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and using it speaking as</font>

317
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,930
an individual with scars from UDP

318
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:57,680
encapsulation and check some nonsense if

319
00:20:53,930 --> 00:21:02,120
this provides a better solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

320
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:04,250
people who don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the UDP you p</font>

321
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,110
checksum because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a trailer but</font>

322
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,640
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to actually check</font>

323
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,678
some a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that they care about</font>

324
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,470
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh say the port numbers in the UDP</font>

325
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:17,620
header and use the UDP<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol number</font>

326
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:17,620
as individual this could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be quite useful</font>

327
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:27,460
anybody else<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to come</font>

328
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:48,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're more discussion on list</font>

329
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:51,520
I hope okay and dr. Benson yes q just

330
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:54,429
check walking over<font color="#E5E5E5"> hello hello everybody</font>

331
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,668
so I'm Vincent and I will introduce you

332
00:21:54,429 --> 00:22:00,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">the update</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this document I already</font>

333
00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:02,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">presented that Berlin meeting so this is</font>

334
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:04,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">factoring version 2 and the goal is to</font>

335
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:09,820
add support<font color="#E5E5E5"> for congressional ethics</font>

336
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:13,390
codes to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact framework just to</font>

337
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:14,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">show just to to to point out the fact</font>

338
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:17,740
that we didn't try to patent anything

339
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:20,520
this document okay so this is a reminder

340
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:23,500
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> effect frame and what were posing</font>

341
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:26,260
very compact manga so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

342
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:31,380
follow-up<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ofc 6363 that was published</font>

343
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:34,390
in 2011 by myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aly and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mark Watson</font>

344
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:36,490
fact frame is in fact morishim layer

345
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:40,690
than a protocol which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it fits</font>

346
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:43,090
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> RP and UDP most of the time and</font>

347
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:45,159
the goal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to enable robust and</font>

348
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:50,620
scalable communications of contents and

349
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:52,510
particularly real-time contents so we

350
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,010
assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

351
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,679
interested by same content at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

352
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:59,110
time which makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it meaningful to use</font>

353
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:03,730
multicast and broadcast communications

354
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:06,850
that's the goal of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact frame it's</font>

355
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:09,159
already included in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 PP mbms so multi</font>

356
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:11,830
multi media broadcast and multicast

357
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:15,130
services and we start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have some</font>

358
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:18,149
deployment experience the issue is that

359
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:22,539
fake frame requires that you are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

360
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:24,428
block FEC codes which turns out to be a

361
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:27,309
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit inefficient in terms of</font>

362
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:30,299
latency it adds significant latency to

363
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:33,490
all the participants all the time and

364
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:36,129
this issue can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really solved totally</font>

365
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:39,460
solved almost by using conversion

366
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:41,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">alleged codes that works differently in</font>

367
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,970
very good reception

368
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,130
conditions receiver will not experience

369
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:47,590
any latency from this point of view when

370
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:49,570
I mean when I say in Latin see I mean

371
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,399
fake related latency of course that has

372
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:53,320
nothing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with the communication</font>

373
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,809
latency which is a different problem but

374
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,090
no latency from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fake point of view</font>

375
00:23:55,809 --> 00:24:00,928
and in bad reception conditions you

376
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:04,149
still have a very slow smaller latency

377
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:05,980
compared to that of block codes so the

378
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:08,080
goal of fake friend version 2 is just to

379
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:11,980
add conversion called support to this

380
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,480
specification the<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference is with the</font>

previous version<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i presented</font>

382
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">bearing out the following</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had an</font>

383
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:24,850

suggested by ifc 679<font color="#CCCCCC"> 32 so just do to</font>

385
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:29,918
tell you what's going on from this point

386
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,830
of view we already have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a implementation</font>

387
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,080
of fake frame version<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 so which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

388
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:39,340
commercial for which we start to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

389
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:42,610
some interoperability experience and

390
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:44,770
deployments and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am in the currently</font>

391
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:48,610
implementing fake friend version<font color="#E5E5E5"> 24</font>

392
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:53,080
based on these existing source code so

393
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:54,639
that's it then we also added an

394
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,290
additional section at the end of the

395
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,960
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> that explains what are the</font>

396
00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:01,678

mistakes in the document but nothing

399
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:10,299
very important I would not like to go

400
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:13,179
into details but just highlight one

401
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:15,750
point so we also make progress in terms

of blog<font color="#CCCCCC"> vs. congressional</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> English</font>

00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:27,130
that honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking I don't</font>

understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> why this work has not been</font>

407

done before because I really really a

408
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:34,750
big improvement in terms of latency by

409
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:37,419
using a conversion factor cut it really

00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:41,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes sense to do that so you have the</font>

question for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> group and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would like</font>

419
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,580
the following should we continue calling

420
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:06,940
this version 2 or should we just say

421
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:09,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">well this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not date of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FC 6363 that</font>

00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:12,910
would be absolutely so some background

one additional capability being able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

434
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:42,880
at the effect and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Connie ID that</font>

435
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,830
identify the feck scheme and if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">a fake skin that does not support that</font>

437
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:48,790
this receiver does not support then you

438
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,610
just have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or no I don't want I</font>

439
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:54,190
cannot and then you choose an

440
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:56,020
association for instance this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is exactly</font>

441
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:57,610
the same mechanism regardless of whether

442
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,230
you are using black cards or

443
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:02,530
convolutional codes no change from this

444
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:04,510
point of view I so<font color="#E5E5E5"> fat point this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

445
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:06,580
probably the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most important one there is</font>

446
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:08,470
no version number in fact friend Vikram

447
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:10,840
in fact is not really a protocol as I

448
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:14,290
said smashing layer there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no effect</font>

452
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:25,689

454
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:31,720
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it makes it clear that we</font>

455
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:34,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> support additional effects schemes</font>

456
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:37,210
from the implementation point view it

457
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:39,610
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> i liked the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is</font>

458
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:41,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different in fact when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you try</font>

459
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:43,030
to implement both Russian one version to

460
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,940
you will see that there's a big

461
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:48,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">difference in implementing conversion</font>

462
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:50,860
cut support<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not speaking about the</font>

463
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:52,870
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> scheme itself which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font>

464
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:55,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">different but just the way you have to</font>

465
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:57,370
manage packets the way you have to

466
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:01,270
manage symbols<font color="#E5E5E5"> data management all those</font>

467
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:03,760
aspects are more complex with this

468
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:07,210
version<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the main benefit I</font>

469
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,970
see in having this version to tag to

470
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:13,750
this work

471
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:16,240
so if you have some opinion on what to

472
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:20,590
do version 2 versus an evolution<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an</font>

473
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:27,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">existing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IC and then let us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we will</font>

474
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:30,100
depreciate no nothing special<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let</font>

475
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:34,000
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that i can ask ask a few</font>

476
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:38,520
questions from you hear ya<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what had</font>

477
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,350
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> change in RFC 6363 the pcrc</font>

478
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:44,740

479
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:48,550
implement what implement this work yes

480
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:51,400
we change all the mentions that were

481
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:55,210
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific to block codes so for</font>

482

<font color="#E5E5E5">instance if in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ifc 63 63 text mentions</font>

483
00:28:55,210 --> 00:29:00,340
that okay we accumulate a certain number

484
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,690
of sauce packets and then we create a

485
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:05,649
blood guts and then you do a fishy

486
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:09,580
encoding make it simple then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

487
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:11,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that into the following way so we say</font>

488
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:14,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in case of block codes then we</font>

489
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:16,899
accumulated rather blah the same text

490
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,270
but in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of convolutional codes then</font>

491
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,400
we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else this is basically</font>

492
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:24,430
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> main difference in our between I've</font>

493
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:28,030
see 653 and what we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposing and we</font>

494
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:30,700
do that throughout the document whenever

495
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:33,180
it is required so we add something else

496
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:35,440
we don't remove anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what causes</font>

497
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:38,460
implementation differences that you

498
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">describe it sounds like the 6363</font>

499
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:44,680
protocol is kept intact you simply

500
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:46,990
change the way the compression codes

501
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:49,120
work so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get stuff out of</font>

502
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:50,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">them fast recursive comp using</font>

503
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,500
convolution codes these are block codes

504
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:58,630
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes we do not remove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

505
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:00,460
if you use a fake friend version 2 in

506
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,740
the traditional way with blood codes it

507
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,990
won't make any change to the receiver

508
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,930
they won't notice anything that does

509
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:09,850
absolutely nothing new yeah but you have

510
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:12,280
this capability of using something else

511
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:15,459
of using different obstacles and in fact

512
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:18,490
a fact frame is agnostic is more less

513
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:21,520
agnostic with respect to the block<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

514
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:25,470
the cuts you are using

515
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:30,629
we are so so far in<font color="#CCCCCC"> I c63 you can use</font>

516
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:32,560
maybe five different block FC codes

517
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:35,140
receiver will not necessarily support

518
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:39,820
all of them what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are proposing is</font>

519
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:42,370
just adding some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more FC codes that were</font>

520
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,560
differently to this list this sounds

521
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:46,830
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an extension updates I think what</font>

522
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:50,169
you just said is that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I take a</font>

523
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:53,560
version to sender and try to

524
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:56,440
interoperate with a version 1 6363

525
00:30:53,560 --> 00:31:00,129
receiver the receiver see is a bunch of

526
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,600
codes advertised<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody support and so</font>

527
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,520
much it simply doesn't recognize and

528
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,439
picks one picks one that supports

529
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:09,250
everybody falls falls falls back to

530
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:12,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">using one of the block codes yes if you</font>

531
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:16,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to have a backward compatibility</font>

532
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:18,610
and you are a version to sender<font color="#E5E5E5"> than you</font>

533
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:20,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">should I think the best solution is to</font>

534
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,929
have two different sessions one with the

535
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:26,290
locals 11 convolutional codes and let's

536
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:28,840
let it do it's not big overhead in terms

537
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:32,440
of network communications because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

538
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:35,800
addressing a single flow addresses tens

539
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,120
of thousands of receivers it's not big

540
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,850
deal from this point of view and it's

541
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,649
easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix funny we should look at on</font>

542
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:44,020
the list but base<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you've described</font>

543
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:47,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I what I think I'm hearing sounds</font>

544
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:49,120
like an extension<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 63 63 and oh by the</font>

545
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:51,280
way there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some language in there that</font>

546
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,020
didn't anticipate convolution codes that

547
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,180
requires some what are effectively

548
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,110
editorial substitutions to avoid saying

549
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,150
things that aren't true about

550
00:31:56,110 --> 00:32:00,909
convolution codes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so by extension</font>

551
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:04,720
you mean do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not add this notion of</font>

552
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:08,830
version 2 but just continue as<font color="#E5E5E5"> effect</font>

553
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:11,860
frame if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I send um what's the difference</font>

554
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:14,290
in receiver behavior if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say version</font>

555
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:19,240
too but only advertise the block codes

556
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:26,350
in the in the setup oh sorry I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get</font>

557
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:28,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay sender sends the setup code info to</font>

558
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:31,060
the receiver<font color="#E5E5E5"> and says hi I want to speak</font>

559
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:33,790
version 2 and here the codes I support

560
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:34,770
but lists only the block codes in 63 63

561
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:37,170
there's a ver

562
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:39,450
to tag have any effect on the receivers

563
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:41,340
behavior no absolutely no effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

564
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:43,410
then that i'm pretty sure you've got an

565
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,659
extension you know have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be an update</font>

566
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:47,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">because there is text that doesn't apply</font>

567
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,050
the convolution codes but this sounds

568
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:52,020
like we ought to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about this</font>

569
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:54,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">as an extension to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6363 because that</font>

570
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:56,610
those are all really good backwards

571
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,710
compatibility answers yeah okay okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

572
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:07,550
we will get rid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of further discussion to</font>

573
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:13,590
notion okay good thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and okay who</font>

574
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:17,100
work here hang on hey go hey okay so

575
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:20,100
next step well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't expect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

576
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:24,629
measure change in these<font color="#E5E5E5"> documents</font>

577
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:27,959
anymore I think it's now quite stable my

578
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:29,580
first to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on is to finish this</font>

579
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,700
implementation of way that will be done

580
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:34,350
for next IDF and just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sure</font>

581
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,960
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't miss</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything important</font>

582
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:40,469
but well I've already implemented the

583
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,380
center side now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to finalize the</font>

584
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:44,730
receiver side I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm okay but I</font>

585
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,310
would be more confident when it's

586
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:49,770
working very well that's my first point

587
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:51,690
and second point so it makes no sense to

588
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:54,480
have a flag framework if we don't have

589
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:57,030
an effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> scheme to put in it I mean</font>

590
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,960
conversion effects Kim so what I'm

591
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:04,530
proposing here is to specify this very

592
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,930
basic conversion<font color="#E5E5E5"> facts Kim called I'll</font>

593
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:09,029
see randomly<font color="#CCCCCC"> not codes it's pretty</font>

594
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:10,350
simple to explain I can explain to you

595
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:13,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">in two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes you will understand</font>

596
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:15,179
there's nothing complex in it and so we

597
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:17,669
have to specify the code details but

598
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:19,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not big deal the signaling aspects</font>

599
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:22,139
while we already implemented it so I

600
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:24,418
guess it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be okay like that's always</font>

601
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:26,879
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some expansion from this point</font>

602
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:29,370
of view and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask for inr</font>

603
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:32,220
expression for the effect the new

604
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:34,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">freakin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kuniaki oh that's anyway this is</font>

605
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:36,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way we I want penetration works for</font>

606
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:38,810
the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a basic solution basic</font>

607
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:42,450
scheme that while using a lump image

608
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:44,850
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it okay sounds from process</font>

609
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:47,310
standpoint what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would you like the</font>

610
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:48,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">working group to do when and I'll give</font>

611
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:51,210
you a strong man

612
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:54,690
go go go go I'll give you a straw person

613
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:56,670
proposal we can think we can start from

614
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:58,530
there which is it sounds like you've

615
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:01,410
gots implantation work to do and you

616
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:05,460
need you need to write up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

617
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:07,560
on this slide so you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a dress and</font>

618
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,240
so sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the next means like you</font>

619
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,700
likely have a draft or two that we can

620
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,350
look at adopting at that point yes for

621
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,270
next meeting actually make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

622
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:23,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">ladies what can go pick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them addiction</font>

623
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:27,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">be sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there is interest yeah I can</font>

624
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:29,730
also mention that I'm keeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

625
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:31,230
networking we<font color="#E5E5E5"> so trooper well this work</font>

626
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:34,350
in fact this work has been initiated

627
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:37,950
there and so there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more people</font>

628
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:42,690
they're aware of this and night to read

629
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:44,640
and comment on this large<font color="#CCCCCC"> eggert so are</font>

630
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,720
there other people implementing this so

631
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,629
will there be an independent

632
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:51,930
implementation buddy as far as I know no

633
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:53,970
not yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be so</font>

634
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:56,040
this is a sort of a general comment that

635
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:59,279
I that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always make for these you know</font>

636
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:02,460
more specialized things um because if

637
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,770
the authors also implement the code it's

638
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:07,560
it's great that you're doing this but um

639
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:08,940
and it's better than<font color="#CCCCCC"> not doing it but it</font>

640
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,930
would be even better if somebody else

641
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,870
would read the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> and try to</font>

642
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:15,180
implement it in there right um shall

643
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,529
shine because otherwise if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have you</font>

644
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:19,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys are the only people implementing it</font>

645
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:20,930
why do we need a standard and yes

646
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,069
especially as it is not open source

647
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:25,379
implementation so I do understand this

648
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:27,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">ss-sure there are implementations in</font>

649
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:30,180
turbo inter proble implementations for

650
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:34,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">fixed frame sure but not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say</font>

651
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:36,509
this one this extension<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay be start</font>

652
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:38,400
jabber comment David may be about to ask

653
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Corey is interested in</font>

654
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">how many people in the room we've read</font>

655
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:45,509
the draft that certain if you okay let's

656
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,980
go find out how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people read the</font>

657
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:52,290
draft raise your hand I don't see any

658
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:56,670
hands raised anything yeah yeah bro it's

659
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:58,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">an impressive draft because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fast free</font>

660
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:01,740
is quite impressive it's quite long it

661
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,430
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe 60 or 70 pages long and we are</font>

662
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:07,078
the shoe

663
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:10,020
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> well five pages more perhaps five</font>

664
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:11,790
six MOS is great i don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i might</font>

665
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:16,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggest you but let's eat on the halls</font>

666
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:17,670
I'm sorry yes I would just like if you

667
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:19,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">do the diff and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you should look at the</font>

668
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:22,230
diff between<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've c66</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

669
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:24,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">document it's not that long right so</font>

670
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:25,410
what I would suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would couple</font>

671
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:28,920
suggestions one is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> buttonholes</font>

672
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:33,808
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the hall to read the draft the</font>

673
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:37,950
second is if this turns into an<font color="#E5E5E5"> update</font>

674
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:40,140
you don't need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reproduce all the 6363</font>

675
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:42,509
text you need to write the text on new

676
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:45,569
convolution codes and then explain what

677
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:47,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">chain what has to change in 63 63 to</font>

678
00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:49,319
allow them you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to you don't</font>

679
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:53,550
have to completely replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> 60 36 all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

680
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:55,250
texts 6363 and obsolete it yes so what

681
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:59,640
will happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when you've done 62 63</font>

682
00:37:55,250 --> 00:38:02,130
remains a work remains an adopted RFC

683
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,779
and then you have this additional draft

684
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:06,390
that says here's how to do convolution

685
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:08,730
codes with 63 63 you know by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

686
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:10,470
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> texas 6363 gets changed as</font>

687
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:13,410
follows to a lot of convolution codes to

688
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:15,509
work ok so the annex<font color="#E5E5E5"> the appendix that</font>

689
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:19,410
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> added that explains the differences</font>

690
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:21,869
would be sufficient for that um it's

691
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:23,759
probably a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> starting point in</font>

692
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:26,869
essence the difference is opposed to

693
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:30,990
writing a 63 63 bits that completely

694
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:33,359
replaces that RFC you right what is what

695
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:36,390
is in effect a companion document that

696
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:38,970
is red with 63 63 to tell you how to

697
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:42,299
start to q3 63 and get convolution codes

698
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:43,859
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> addition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to block codes okay and i</font>

699
00:38:42,299 --> 00:38:45,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">just had structure among other things</font>

700
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:46,950
it's likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> the result in a much shorter</font>

701
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:52,160
draft maybe we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get more people to</font>

702
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:52,160
read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

703
00:38:54,940 --> 00:39:09,529
in the other business I think we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

704
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:14,329
I believe tsv area meet this afternoon

705
00:39:09,529 --> 00:39:16,730
is that correct yes and so bring general

706
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:20,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">transfor questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the TSP are a</font>

707
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:20,799
meeting thank you very much everybody

708
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:52,940
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right yeah and and</font>

709
