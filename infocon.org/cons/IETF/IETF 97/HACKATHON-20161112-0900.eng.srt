00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:09,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ietf and I wanting to open this</font>

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,000
event and welcome you all here thank you

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,399
for coming good crowd great to see you

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,920
here and I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the previous</font>

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,560
events as well of course and I always

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">found it very interesting what you guys</font>

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,580
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on what the participants in</font>

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,440
those events were working on so I'm

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,589
excited to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see what what you're going to</font>

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,170
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today and tomorrow and of</font>

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">course we're here because the essence of</font>

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,000
the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the ITF as well is not</font>

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,429
just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know specifications and papers</font>

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,260
but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's about running code that's</font>

15
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,390
what actually makes makes the internet

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,670
work so we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build that we're</font>

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to figure out what kind of cool</font>

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:52,109
things we can actually innovate and

19
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:53,699
build here and get going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm not</font>

20
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:57,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk any longer I'm just going</font>

21
00:00:53,699 --> 00:01:11,310
to let the co-chairs jaws and Barry take

22
00:00:57,269 --> 00:01:13,860
over and again welcome great<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font>

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">you Yuri and yet to those of you who</font>

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know me I'm Charles echo been</font>

25
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,770
working with the IETF to put on these

26
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,259
hackathons for a while now this is

27
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:26,369
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sixth the version of it</font>

28
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:28,170
already if you can believe that and as

29
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:29,250
you already mentioned really the key

30
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,240
thing here is we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to produce more</font>

31
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">running code ideally if that's open</font>

32
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,048
source code it's even better the idea

33
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,180
being that it not only then serves as a

34
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,619
way to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some of the standards</font>

35
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,719
that we're defining but actually to help

36
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">you understand them a bit better having</font>

37
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,679
the specs great having some code that

38
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,000
implements<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's even better and hey if</font>

39
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,450
you can grab that code and start

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,429
integrating it into whatever project or

41
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:55,829
needs you have that that's that's even

42
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:57,329
better still so the goal there being

43
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,669
that we want to speed up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the work that's</font>

44
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,199
going on in the ITF not only to define

45
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,749
the standard but to adopt it get it

46
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,329
implemented and get it deployed<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

47
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:08,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so that's all great but we also want</font>

48
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,228
to collaborate that's very important to

49
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">have some fun here take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of the</font>

50
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,220
fact of these people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are around you</font>

51
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,110
the people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you always</font>

52
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,940
gravitate to and and and it's great to

53
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">see them right but</font>

54
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,510
talk to the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know we</font>

55
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,920
have just a wealth of talent and skills

56
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,940
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of standards in terms of</font>

57
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,530
programming I see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot it you know</font>

58
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">familiar faces a lot of new faces so get</font>

59
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,630
to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people around you and really</font>

60
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,490
take advantage of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course</font>

61
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,070
cookies or whatever the local rendition

62
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:45,390
is is going to be great and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

63
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:49,109
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> beer more on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later so a couple</font>

64
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:52,250
serious things we operate under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the note</font>

65
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:54,570
well as everything else in the IETF does

66
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,520
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't seen that yet check</font>

67
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,720
check that out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

68
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,130
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there's nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really in the</font>

69
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,300
note well that talks directly to code so

70
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:06,000
we've done a little work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

71
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,160
still a work in progress I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,720
think we have a know if we have it more

73
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,090
defined than this kind of this loose

74
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,650
definition that I have here but the idea

75
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,570
here is that in when it comes to code

76
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,950
you're operating under the note well but

77
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,079
we thought we'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> give a little bit of</font>

78
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,119
clues as to how it maps to code so

79
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,190
you're still you're free to work on any

80
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,220
code you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want usually there's going to</font>

81
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,020
be some rules around that code a license

82
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,200
around it you're subject to the rules of

83
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in terms of how you use and</font>

84
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,310
contribute to that code base the code

85
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you work on here itself is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

86
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,000
ietf contribution what is an IHF

87
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,489
contribution is when you come to the mic

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,100
give a presentation or something like

89
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:45,959
that the stuff you put on these posters

90
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,160
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it would be in any working</font>

91
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,840
group sort of meeting when you're

92
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:54,150
contributing that way that's kind of the

93
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:56,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">way it works here as well and to help</font>

94
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">you collaborate on code this is totally</font>

95
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,149
optional but if if you don't already

96
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,800
have a place where your codes hosted

97
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,510
because if you do that's just keep

98
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,130
working doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you you normally do</font>

99
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,280
but if you need a place to put your code

100
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:10,650
so that the folks working on it can work

101
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,170
with you together we created a an

102
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,810
organization within github where we host

103
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:18,450
the projects and so if you've never used

104
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,668
get or github before we have just a

105
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,950
brief tutorial for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> there some links</font>

106
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:25,830
and you can see here we have a few

107
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:28,320
projects from previous hackathons so if

108
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,990
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this for your project</font>

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,599
for your team let me know

110
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,770
your github ID and if you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,050
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create one that's very</font>

112
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,549
simple and we can get a project created

113
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:45,030
for you and you guys can then share your

114
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:47,040
code using this so let me briefly run

115
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,020
through the agenda this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> roughly where</font>

116
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,790
we're at now doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kickoff and I</font>

117
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">promise not to take too much time with</font>

118
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,890
it as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as we finish with this we're</font>

119
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to end with kind of pointing out</font>

120
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:02,849
where the various project teams are and

121
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:05,340
then Barry and myself and yari will help

122
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,500
you if you need any help<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll help you</font>

123
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:11,190
find the right people here get you

124
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,110
settled and and working is part of a one

125
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,820
or more teams here so that's really

126
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,620
important it we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend as</font>

127
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,450
much time<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that as it takes usually it</font>

128
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,950
doesn't take much time at all but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

129
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,210
critical to get every one plugged in and

130
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,120
working on something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's of interest</font>

131
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,280
to them where<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can contribute lunch</font>

132
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,660
will be brought in here hopefully it

133
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,820
works for you can just stay here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

134
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,560
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work through lunch that</font>

135
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,590
would be fantastic we can really make

136
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,300
the most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time together we'll have</font>

137
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:40,590
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about snacks brought in in the</font>

138
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:42,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">afternoon and then in the evening we're</font>

139
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,010
actually going to have dinner brought in

140
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,450
as well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just before that will kind</font>

141
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">of have this little sort of optional</font>

142
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,469
progress check just to make sure that

143
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,500
everyone's working on something that's

144
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:54,600
of interest will let if anyone wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

145
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,550
it's a time when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can share what's</font>

146
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,590
happened so far maybe if you have some

147
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,120
thoughts about you you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask some</font>

148
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,710
questions to the group see if you can

149
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,200
pull in people with other expertise or

150
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,060
or anything like that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

151
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,039
good conversation starter so that then

152
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,450
when we do break for dinner you guys

153
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,250
might want to sit at different tables

154
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,719
right and get to discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> with other</font>

161
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:31,170
and the ITF<font color="#CCCCCC"> network is still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be there</font>

172
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,010
thing though is to realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

180
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,270

181
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,390
when we're going to start and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

182
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:23,159

211
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:41,728
mentioned the project presentations and

212
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,929
just these have to be very brief because

213
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:48,120
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get them all done in an hour</font>

214
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:49,650
and so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it think of we</font>

215
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,260
have fewer projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think this year</font>

216
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">cuz just fewer teams but we may have to</font>

217
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,340
adjust us a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's going to</font>

218
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">be around four minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going to be</font>

219
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,330
the time limit you're going to have

220
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,760
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> three maybe five will let you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

221
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:05,120
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> but keep that in mind and really</font>

222
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,650
it's what was it you were trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

223
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,910
what did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> achieve and then very</font>

224
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">importantly what's kind of the the</font>

225
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">lessons learned or the highlights that</font>

226
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,150
you want the ietf to take away and maybe

227
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,939
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to bring into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your working</font>

228
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,990
group based on what you learned the

229
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">judges we mentioned we'd be having some</font>

230
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,170
judges they're really going to judge you

231
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,170
based on those goals that you saw at the

232
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:26,579
beginning you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what kind of code are</font>

ITF 97 if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use those hashtags we'll</font>

247
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,490

that we award for whoever takes that the

249

251
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:21,000
want to thank our hackathon sponsor

252
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">Huawei they sponsored the last two and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">super competitive right it's more</font>

263
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,080
things for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be aware of so the</font>

264
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,550
hackathon ends at four pm but for those

265
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,350
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to continue to be able to work</font>

266
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:55,620
together we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to set aside some</font>

267
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:58,830
space within the IETF lounge I have a

268
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,810
little pointer here to where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's</font>

269
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:03,000
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sixth floor just one floor up</font>

270
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,530
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be right in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle that's</font>

271
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,470
right where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are now actually two</font>

272
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,120
anyways just right up there so during

273
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,590
the week if you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to use that</font>

274
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,500
just kind of informal thing you don't

275
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,900
need to reserve it

276
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,760
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything but to show up and it's just</font>

277
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:21,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">a way that you can gather work on code</font>

278
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:24,010
together and on Thursday as we've done

279
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:26,470
in the past will have a table<font color="#E5E5E5"> at bits</font>

280
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,850
and bytes and the idea being here if

281
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,470
there's something you worked on in the

282
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:32,170
