00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:11,129
jection in a coordination delia mirkwood

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,129
wrong hmmm yeah let's rock start

3
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:17,640
restarting welcome to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second session</font>

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the HTA p working group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the week</font>

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,140
we've got just one hour unfortunately

6
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,759
and we have a number of presentations so

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,220
we're going to walk through those as

8
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:29,470
quickly as<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can these are going to be</font>

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:32,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">the beginning of a number of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> discussions</font>

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,719
it's not going to be the end so please

11
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:36,669
if you do have comments keep in mind

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we do have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very little time for</font>

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:41,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">each presentation this is the note well</font>

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,550
which you should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with now if</font>

15
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,930
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not then then spend some time</font>

16
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,830
with it away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the working group</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

17
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,790
then come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're you're</font>

18
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:51,250
comfortable and this is our agenda<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

19
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:53,410
the day so we've got what is it now six

20
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:56,590
presentations hopefully in 60 minutes in

21
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,819
60 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do the math um let's go</font>

22
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:05,049
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get started I think let's jump</font>

23
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:12,940
right into it my case and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

24
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:14,340
pink box the famous pink box doesn't can

25
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:21,970
you work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with him to rape ones and see</font>

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:25,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay okay hello I'm Emily</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Stark I'm here</font>

27
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:27,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the chrome team um this is an old</font>

28
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,340
version of slides so this is gonna be a

29
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:33,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">little exciting we'll see how cos so um</font>

30
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:36,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm here to discuss a proposal called</font>

31
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:39,520
expect CT which is can be approximately

32
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:43,960
thought of as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> chesty s4 certificate</font>

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,390
transparency um I suspect that many of

34
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,030
you are very familiar with certificate

35
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:52,360
transparency if you're not I'll give a

36
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:55,869
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of background um CT is a</font>

37
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,990
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that allows public logging of</font>

38
00:01:55,869 --> 00:02:01,780
certificates so um concrete concretely

39
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:05,289
in the context of this presentation you

40
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:07,540
can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a TLS server that has a</font>

41
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:10,119
certificate that certificate gets

42
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:14,010
submitted to one or more<font color="#E5E5E5"> certificate</font>

43
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:16,569
transparency logs those logs provide a

44
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,890
verifiable promise that they they plan

45
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,929
to

46
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:23,079
operate that certificate in a way that

47
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">can be publicly audited this verifiable</font>

48
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,180
promise is called a signed certificate

49
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:30,280
time soon put an SCT and the server will

50
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,230
provide these s cts on the connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

51
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">the client which can verify in the TLS</font>

52
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:37,510
handshake that that a log that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

53
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:42,070
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> trusts plans to publicly</font>

54
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:44,950
incorporate this certificate um so

55
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,420
significant transparency ideally in the

56
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:50,859
future we would like to imagine that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

57
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:52,570
TLS clients would would would verify

58
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,640
certificate transparency information on

59
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:56,430
all connections that they make and<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

60
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,470
so would have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of benefits</font>

61
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,060
domain owners could monitor the logs for

62
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,060
certificates that they don't expect to

63
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,800
appear there um and they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

64
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,750
any certificate that is accepted by a

65
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,660
client would appear in a certificate

66
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,940
transparency log and it also provides

67
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:18,430
value for other parties who might want

68
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:22,269
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say monitor for CA misbehavior um so</font>

69
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,530
that's an ideal future but today site

70
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,790
owners<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get the full security</font>

71
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,610
benefits of certificate transparency

72
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,500
because there's no way to guarantee<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

73
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,690
any certificate that is accepted by us a

74
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,870
web browser actually appears in the CT

75
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:36,400
logs so site owners today don't get um

76
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,560
protection against a Miss issued

77
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,140
certificate that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't actually</font>

78
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:47,950
appear in the CT logs so an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ex like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

79
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:50,828
so um expect CT is basically an opt-in

80
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:53,170
kind of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a chess yes a HTTP response</font>

81
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:55,930
header that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a site can send to ask the</font>

82
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:59,048
browser to kind of hold them to CT to

83
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:01,060
require to require that<font color="#CCCCCC"> any connection</font>

84
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:04,570
to this site in the future<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some</font>

85
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:08,100
period of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> um is comes along with</font>

86
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:11,440
valid certificate transparency info um

87
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:14,680
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of a straw me on syntax</font>

88
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:19,450
from the draft um probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> very familiar</font>

89
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,070
from HS TF uh it wouldn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fight</font>

90
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">sends this response header asks the</font>

91
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:27,849
browser to to remember that the site

92
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:29,289
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be should be connected to with CT</font>

93
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:32,438
compliance

94
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:34,719
has a max age and much like<font color="#E5E5E5"> HP KP has a</font>

95
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,729
report URI so that the site can be

96
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:41,800
notified<font color="#E5E5E5"> of violations or</font>

97
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:45,188
<font color="#E5E5E5">misconfigurations and also much like HP</font>

98
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,490
KP comes with a report only mode one

99
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:50,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">example use case for this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a site</font>

100
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,210
might want to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gain confidence in</font>

101
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:54,099
its operations before going into the

102
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:59,710
enforcement mode where their users might

103
00:04:54,099 --> 00:05:02,229
start seeing failed connections so let's

104
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,149
see a couple of a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> high points</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

105
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:05,800
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull out here one of the main</font>

106
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:08,020
goals here is to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

107
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,919
easy to deploy familiar to site

108
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:15,580
operators especially easy to deploy

109
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:18,878
deploy soon and I'll talk um I'll

110
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,740
describe that a little bit more um but

111
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">also the the overall goal here is</font>

112
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,149
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give site owners away to to</font>

113
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:27,639
ensure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the certificates that</font>

114
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:31,539
you I accepts for their for their site

115
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:33,459
is a pure in the public CT logs um so

116
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:36,759
I'm missing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a slide after this one but</font>

117
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:38,080
basically I why I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um that it's</font>

118
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:39,309
especially important that this is

119
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,719
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that site owners can deploy</font>

120
00:05:39,309 --> 00:05:44,889
easily and soon is because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what might</font>

121
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:47,558
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of an elephant in the</font>

122
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:49,779
room which is that chrome recently

123
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:51,459
announced plans to require a CT for all

124
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:54,669
new certificates starting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> October</font>

125
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:56,589
2017 so you might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> wondering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how these</font>

126
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:59,289
things interact how they expect CT

127
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:02,019
proposal interacts with this chrome CT

128
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:04,659
requirement date and I'll say a few

129
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:07,330
things about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so so first of all we</font>

130
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:09,369
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a good chunk of value</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

131
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,308
be had and expects<font color="#CCCCCC"> et in kind of</font>

132
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:14,139
transitioning the ecosystem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font>

133
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:16,419
chrome CT requirement day and any other

134
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:19,529
CT requirement dates that might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

135
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:24,399
announced in future by other browsers um

136
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:26,619
so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if a site is is getting</font>

137
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,689
certificates from a CA and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CA is</font>

138
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:30,909
embedding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> s cts into the certificate</font>

139
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:32,999
the site might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use expect CT</font>

140
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:35,558
before the chrome CT requirement date to

141
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:38,199
make sure that their CA is doing things

142
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:41,019
properly so that they can find out now

143
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,160
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> not instead of in October when their</font>

144
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:45,460
site breaks

145
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,550
and it's out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their control um let's</font>

146
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:51,400
see so so that's so so expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> CTS sort</font>

147
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a step on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a gradual adoption of CT</font>

149
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,690

150
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,920
adoption of CT and other browsers and

151
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,200
then of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course there's also the</font>

152
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,240
consideration<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the chrome CT</font>

153
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,090
requirement date is for new certificates

154
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,990
so any certificate issued in<font color="#CCCCCC"> October</font>

155
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:14,650
2017 or later um will be required to

156
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:17,680
have to have CT information but that

157
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:19,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't protect sign owners from um old</font>

159
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:25,780
october or backdated<font color="#CCCCCC"> certificates so if</font>

160
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,630
a misbehaving CA hypothetically decides

161
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,419
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> back date back data CA I mean</font>

162
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:33,340
backdate a certificate um and not put

163
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,750
that certificate<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the CT logs that</font>

164
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,919
certificate wouldn't be subject to

165
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:45,660
Chrome's CT requirement um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay ignore</font>

166
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:48,340
this go back thank you um um ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> so um my</font>

167
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,490
my actual next steps here were to pull

168
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,960
out a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions and issues that came</font>

169
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,120
up on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list in the past few</font>

170
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,570
days um so let's see if I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember</font>

171
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">them all off to top my head um so one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

172
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,620
them was that came up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mailing</font>

173
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:05,169
list was some tactically weather should

174
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,970
be a set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hsps directives or a</font>

175
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:11,950
separate header as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft currently</font>

176
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:14,169
proposes um another one was the question

177
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:17,890
of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly the report only mode</font>

178
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:20,560
should behave so um the issue there is

179
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:22,450
that a site owner might expect and might

180
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,640
want the report<font color="#E5E5E5"> only mode to be</font>

181
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:28,150
remembered or cash the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same way that the</font>

182
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:31,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">enforcement mode is but um that's not</font>

183
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:33,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">how HP KP report only works or CSP</font>

184
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,860
report only so there is a questionnaire

185
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:37,419
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful to site owners what</font>

186
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,400
people how people expect to<font color="#CCCCCC"> require only</font>

187
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:43,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">mode to work and and what what is</font>

188
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:45,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">valuable for for for debugging or</font>

189
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,580
uncovering any misconfigurations that

190
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:51,970
that site owners might encounter and

191
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:54,250
finally um there is a question of what

192
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,150
it actually means to enforce CT which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

193
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't talked about in this</font>

194
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,090
presentation and

195
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,310
that's because browsers kind of have

196
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:03,700
their own idea of what it means to

197
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,530
enforce CT and that may vary from the

198
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,400
list of logs that they trust to the

199
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:12,360
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SVT's that they require etc um</font>

200
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:16,750
so expect CT as defined in the draft is

201
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:19,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> site asking the UI to hold them to</font>

202
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:23,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of whatever CT policy the browser</font>

203
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:25,240
the browser has and so the question is

204
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,430
whether that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful to site owners</font>

205
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,320
whether that is what site owners want or

206
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:32,500
if there is a desire for some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

207
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:36,280
more flexibility or for the expect CT

208
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:40,150
draft itself to define a policy so I'm

209
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:42,100
um looking for feedback from anyone on

210
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:44,680
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I'm specifically interested</font>

211
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:48,450
in feedback from site owners on what

212
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,800
they'd find valuable and useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks</font>

213
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,230
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> mountain Thompson not a site owner</font>

214
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think the the point of our determinism</font>

215
00:09:53,230 --> 00:10:01,450
is one that really needs a bit of

216
00:09:54,910 --> 00:10:05,050
consideration the sites that put this in

217
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:06,820
there in their header fields will have

218
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,740
to expect a certain degree of service

219
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,350
when they put this in a header field I

220
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,150
mean if your policy is like I believe

221
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:17,740
some browsers have currently which is to

222
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:21,939
ignore CT entirely then that may not

223
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:24,070
drive very well with the opposite policy

224
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:29,740
which is the most strict possible policy

225
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:33,580
that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine for for CT so I'm</font>

226
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:35,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">not sure that there's any there's any</font>

227
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">good thing I can recommend but having at</font>

228
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:40,180
least a baseline which is you must at

229
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,830
least go this far would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be good</font>

230
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,709
setting some bounds on what what the

231
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:47,890
policy might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very useful so</font>

232
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:50,500
um if I'm understanding correctly you're

233
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:53,260
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like uh the there's</font>

234
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:56,770
sort of a minimum bar that unexpected

235
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,300
sight must must meet but a UI is free to

236
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:01,360
enforce a strict door policy if they'd

237
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:03,430
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I think the that's true but it's</font>

238
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,650
also true that if you if you have some

239
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,839
uncertainty about the the extent to

240
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,130
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> a browser is going to enforce</font>

241
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,850
policy

242
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:16,980
then you end up risking being locked out

243
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:19,360
of your sight and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably the</font>

244
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,280
the harder line that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to draw</font>

245
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,960
which is if someone's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

246
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,800
stricter about particular aspects of it

247
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,940
then now I speak in ignorance of CT and

248
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,400
Ryan's going to tell me that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm an</font>

249
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:33,130
idiot but I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I would like at</font>

250
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,560
least the maximum to be set rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

251
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:38,800
that rather than a minimum I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Simone</font>

252
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:41,140
is less than less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than what a browser</font>

253
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,140
enforcement wants to enforce then we

254
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:46,840
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem yes that's why you don't</font>

255
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to do that well maybe that maybe</font>

256
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's one of the things that we can do</font>

257
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,579
here or maybe in this the transparency

258
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:57,939
working group right so Ryan sleepy um

259
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:00,340
I'm the one who made<font color="#CCCCCC"> that enough October</font>

260
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,860
so so it's all my fault<font color="#E5E5E5"> blame me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um so</font>

261
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:07,000
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think one of the things that</font>

262
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:08,980
we've seen that we saw just just sharing

263
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,390
an implementation experience that guided

264
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,950
and shapes on the sum of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and the</font>

265
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:16,030
feedback heard was extended validation

266
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,440
chrome had a policy that extended

267
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:20,470
validation certificates must meet a

268
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,930
particular CT policy and what we saw was

269
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,160
was in fact a number of CA is unable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

270
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,530
meet that policy because they have

271
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,600
trouble with reading comprehension we

272
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,280
see this with enough CA incidents that

273
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,070
reading comprehension is a very high bar

274
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,660
for running a CA but it was enough that

275
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,310
there were a number of EV certificates

276
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,620
out there that weren't even able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet</font>

277
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:41,260
you know that policy so I I do take your

278
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,480
point which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know there there's a</font>

279
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,210
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> specify policy but uh you know</font>

280
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,620
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the other hand a number of site</font>

281
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:50,770
operators weren't receiving feedback

282
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,850
that this their certificates weren't

283
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,020
working and understanding where their

284
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,550
certificates were working and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

285
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,370
something you know like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> report only</font>

286
00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:00,359
mechanism as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback right to sort</font>

287
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:03,300
of go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through reporting it didn't sound</font>

288
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:07,030
from from you know your discussion of

289
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:10,209
policy constraints<font color="#E5E5E5"> I certainly going to</font>

290
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:12,010
appreciate setting the maximum right

291
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:14,680
saying the most restrictive<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy but</font>

292
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:16,270
expecting everyone to enforce that but

293
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,920
you see that as as being a normative

294
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,870
requirement than to go forward with

295
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,500
expects a fee<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> must specify the</font>

296
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:24,080
policy in the document as

297
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,330
the normative requirement so<font color="#E5E5E5"> can I just</font>

298
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">do a quick interrupt and and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

299
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,050
great conversation but like we're

300
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,240
incredibly proud constraint yeah but

301
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:34,729
it's not so much yours<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the chain of</font>

302
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">reactions um can we just have a quick</font>

303
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,210
discussion of whether we think it's

304
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,130
interesting to continue this and perhaps

305
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,220
start working this area in this working

306
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:44,180
group I see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> thumbs up from Martin</font>

307
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,430
anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else have any strong opinions</font>

308
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:48,829
about that should we do at home uh-huh

309
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:50,239
what's to hob who thinks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

310
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,830
interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in this area for</font>

311
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">this working group I won't say adopt</font>

312
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,380
this document cuz nothing we're quite

313
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:56,240
there yet we've just started talking

314
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it but is this an area that's</font>

315
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,440
appropriate this group to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on hum</font>

316
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:06,800
now and who thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's not I'm now</font>

317
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:09,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good hi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cilla anchor I was</font>

318
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,270
wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether it is planning plans</font>

319
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,100
to continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on this for other</font>

320
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:15,439
protocols apart from HTTP as well for

321
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:19,940
example when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we add these new features</font>

322
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:23,390
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> HS TS and put in CT vlogs so these</font>

323
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:25,220
things are nice to have four in the TLS

324
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,720
layer we violate these abstractions all

325
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,040
the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we put this into HTTP layer</font>

326
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,890
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally understand why you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

327
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,740
this for ease of deployment and it's

328
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:35,630
much easier for sites to add HTTP

329
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,060
headers right now than to wait for their

330
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,980
openness so update to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but I</font>

331
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">would not like to see the stop here I</font>

332
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:46,850
would love to see a TLS extension which

333
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:49,550
has a CT I put expect CT as well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

334
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:52,640
we have a good forward-thinking solution

335
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:56,000
for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> done not just a stopgap yeah i</font>

336
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:59,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree i am interested in having a</font>

337
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,550
similar discussion for OCSP stapling<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

338
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,500
think the difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

339
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,959
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like for expect CT i would like to</font>

340
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,210
do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that browsers can implement</font>

341
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,940
and sites can deploy very quickly um

342
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,800
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Chrome a big chunk of</font>

343
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:15,080
the value comes from this period between

344
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,290
now and when the CT requirement date

345
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:20,690
hits but for something kind of and also

346
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:23,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">because expect CT kind of has a shop has</font>

347
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:26,300
a natural<font color="#CCCCCC"> shelf-life</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> built in but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

348
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,220
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like um OCSP stapling</font>

349
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,400
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would expect to be</font>

350
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:35,150
longer term I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think some other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mechanism</font>

351
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:37,640
might be better<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

352
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:40,040
just one more<font color="#CCCCCC"> note i uploaded this as an</font>

353
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:43,280
experimental draft um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really</font>

354
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,920
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if that's the that's what operator</font>

355
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,089
nice yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually have one quick</font>

356
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,979
question hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick question for</font>

357
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:51,020
you has any<font color="#E5E5E5"> there been discussion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

358
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:55,820
the potential relationship with likewise

359
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:59,689
work on<font color="#CCCCCC"> origin wide policy um uh sort of</font>

360
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:02,630
i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that i think the it's</font>

361
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:05,270
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the same answer like I don't</font>

362
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">really see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the origin paulo toward and</font>

363
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:09,560
security policy being something that

364
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:11,209
will be implemented and deployed in the

365
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,630
next you know that we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement</font>

366
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:17,420
and deploy in the next year so you want

367
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:28,370
something quicker yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Norris thank</font>

368
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:31,459
you very much thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you sure I will</font>

369
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:33,320
endeavor to get us back<font color="#CCCCCC"> on time okay I</font>

370
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,210
spoke briefly about a cache control

371
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,910
response hundred immutable when we were

372
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,620
last together in Berlin so since that

373
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:43,209
time I've put forward a draft and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

374
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:45,740
talk about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really briefly today ah</font>

375
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,750
so the basic problem facebook reported

376
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:50,150
the twenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of all of their HTTP</font>

377
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,600
responses were 304 and most of these

378
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:54,800
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> for resources that had not existed</font>

379
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,060
for as long as the max age on the

380
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,250
resource so it didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense</font>

381
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were revalidate in them and</font>

382
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:05,619
it turns out this is because people

383
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:07,849
press reload a lot on social media so

384
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:10,489
we've got a cache control extension

385
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:12,409
which is well defined by the cash in RFC

386
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,810
it's a simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> mechanism to assert that</font>

387
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:17,209
fresh responses would receive a 304 if

388
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:19,429
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be revalidated therefore</font>

389
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:22,070
skip the revalidation and<font color="#CCCCCC"> your reload</font>

390
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:24,110
gets faster this mission meshes well

391
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:27,409
with version the URL design patterns

392
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:32,570
where a particular resource only ever

393
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:34,160
has one version next great we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

394
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,860
running code so this has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> out in the</font>

395
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,630
field and<font color="#E5E5E5"> firefox for about six weeks</font>

396
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:41,030
facebook is deployed BBC is deployed it

397
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,410
the interplanetary file system includes

398
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,120
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't really know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is but</font>

399
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:47,090
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes me sound awful smart and future</font>

400
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,800
looking um

401
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:52,050
there are a lot of reports page load

402
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,610
times on reloads<font color="#CCCCCC"> were as much as fifty</font>

403
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,820
percent improves ninety percent fewer

404
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:58,139
transactions obviously basis it's based

405
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,240
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the content and whether people are</font>

406
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:04,010
pressing reload a lot you know do they

407
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:07,070
like me do they not like me reload next

408
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:11,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so there's an attractive there</font>

409
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:13,980
immutable 00 an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> up top you still</font>

410
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,960
have a max age because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> boat</font>

411
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,750
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> applies to still fresh responses</font>

412
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,220
and I got a bunch of feedback on it

413
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,050
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> with respect to</font>

414
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,360
intermediaries all which makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense is</font>

415
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:29,520
pretty easy to address and it requires a

416
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:32,100
one next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so 72 34</font>

417
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,040
defines cache-control extensions and a

418
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,750
registry for them but that requires IETF

419
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,040
review which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> we pretty much need</font>

420
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,270
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn this little thing into a</font>

421
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,909
document order to get it into the

422
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:43,740
registry is this something that we're

423
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:46,350
interested in working on is basically my

424
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,420
question and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beautiful thing</font>

425
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:51,870
about having two chairs now we can have

426
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:53,340
a clean separation of concerns I think

427
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,899
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a lot of discussion of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

428
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,090
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> from what I've seen a lot of</font>

429
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,740
interest in it ice<font color="#E5E5E5"> already saw a thumbs</font>

430
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:00,540
up in the audience well we'll just after

431
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,550
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask that so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can just</font>

432
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,379
probably unless there's any people that

433
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:07,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions or or put anything</font>

434
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,900
out we can probably just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a hum let's</font>

435
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:11,430
do a hum since the lines are gone who

436
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:15,870
thinks we should adopt this document

437
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:20,880
come now who thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should not all we</font>

438
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:23,939
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about it more I'm now who</font>

439
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,050
hums yes from the jabber jabber<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it</font>

440
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:30,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds like we're gonna adopt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

441
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:33,360
document right thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you thanks and next</font>

442
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:42,030
up is Ted can<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone take over jabber</font>

443
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:43,679
channel<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay so as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you folks may</font>

444
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:46,520
remember and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Berlin we talked a little</font>

445
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:50,400
bit about chaired dictionary compression

446
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:52,320
in particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charles said that y and is</font>

447
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,600
quite interested in getting an actual

448
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,399
spec for it since the specs board that

449
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,520
was available did not seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually</font>

450
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,150
reflect his expectations so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

451
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,070
it's

452
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,500
no that's a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> note not that okay</font>

453
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:07,379
so this is it on one slide this is the

454
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,780
entirety of the idea it's an HTTP 11

455
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,610
compatible extension that supports into

456
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,920
response data compression by sharing

457
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,750
data right it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little dictionary you</font>

458
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:19,020
send across and then whenever you look

459
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,820
at your CSS or footer or<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript or</font>

460
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,850
whatever it references the dictionary

461
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,379
rather than getting it for fresh it's

462
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:30,419
rocket science anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> they think that's</font>

463
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:32,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so uh the draft is out</font>

464
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,380
there now draft lee st ch spec

465
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,950
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> wishin was not able to</font>

466
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it so he sent me I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really what not</font>

467
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,470
sure why didn't send somebody else since

468
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:42,180
there are lots of other people he could

469
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:46,170
have sent look Ian could have done this

470
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:48,030
uh next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide the current</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> state of play</font>

471
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,580
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> some deployment but no standard</font>

472
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:51,899
specification there's been interest

473
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:54,570
expressed in getting a specification

474
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:57,680
done on some not sure whether it be

475
00:20:54,570 --> 00:21:00,629
standards track informational whatever

476
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:03,620
the current authors are not available<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

477
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:05,610
drive this but uh Charles makhna be uh

478
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,070
Charles has said that he would be able

479
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:11,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do it he was unfortunately not able</font>

480
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:14,010
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> here but I have his proxy little</font>

481
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:16,110
token that says one drafts worth of

482
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,340
effort from Charles but I'm allowed to

483
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:23,909
spend if the working group is

484
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:27,419
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there's nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

485
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:31,500
jabber chat room<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see two people at the</font>

486
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:33,090
microphone yeah okra scroll up so I did

487
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">skim the security considerations section</font>

488
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:39,120
I don't see anything about side-channel

489
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:40,620
attacks on compression so what stops

490
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,500
this from becoming the same cesspool

491
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:52,860
that we've already seen repeatedly Ryan

492
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:56,790
do you want to answer them nothing

493
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:58,649
finally yeah so this to this issue part

494
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,030
of part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what's happening you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

495
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,220
like that said is there's an

496
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:03,178
implementation that there was an early

497
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,590
draft doesn't quite match the

498
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:06,540
implementation there's an implementation

499
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,399
that needs change because by golly<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

500
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,290
security considerations or not not just

501
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,240
security considerations implementation

502
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:14,280
considerations<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that want to go</font>

503
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,470
forward the index team is quite

504
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,809
interested in this and like that said he

505
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,940
has a token to sort of go forward to see

506
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:22,590
if this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a tractable</font>

507
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,049
you know is there space that the

508
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,760
solution could emerge from or is this

509
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:28,710
going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of side channel so</font>

510
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,160
more or less the the drafters day

511
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:35,340
starting conversation I i think you know

512
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:37,110
we're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerned about not just that</font>

513
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,939
but also you know reliance on open<font color="#E5E5E5"> VC</font>

514
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:41,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">diff a variety of things that sort of</font>

515
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,110
come into play here but if the working

516
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,639
group wants to go forward and spend the

517
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:47,790
energy to discuss that would be

518
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,710
fantastic sure so so just to kind of

519
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:51,870
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very clear</font>

520
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:54,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">from Charles's discussion with us on</font>

521
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:57,270
this that they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not see this draft as</font>

522
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:59,910
ready and we don't either mm-hmm so it

523
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:02,010
would be the starting place and not the

524
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,660
finishing sure I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess my question is</font>

525
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,679
is there some theoretical reason to

526
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,210
believe we can remove the side shell

527
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,799
attacks here because if not is that

528
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,760
maybe we should do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> first before we</font>

529
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,860
start talking at the standardization

530
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">ever okay so Martin behind you is</font>

531
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,939
shaking his head no do you wish to add

532
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:17,610
to this month yes so someone times I I

533
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:20,370
think there's like a series of foot guns

534
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:23,549
aimed in varying directions maybe not<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

535
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:29,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">feet but certainly other sensitive</font>

536
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:31,590
places the there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are ways you can</font>

537
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,870
deploy<font color="#E5E5E5"> this potentially that are safe</font>

538
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,520
but there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very sort of narrow line</font>

539
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,260
to tread when you when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with this</font>

540
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,200
and deal with these<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of things even</font>

541
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,580
if you think it's safe it's probably not

542
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,440
and this is a discussion we didn't have

543
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,059
I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got up here to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

544
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sort of broader problem which is</font>

545
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:53,520
that we now have two drafts in this area

546
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:57,090
potentially more and over an array of

547
00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:00,330
solutions we should first decide well

548
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:02,129
whether we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually ever deploy</font>

549
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:05,070
something like this I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have</font>

550
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:06,300
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to be happy with them but do</font>

551
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:08,490
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> require</font>

552
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:11,010
okay right Ryan's not particularly happy

553
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:13,470
with them do we want to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

554
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:16,170
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there and then what is the</font>

555
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:17,790
right way to do this I'm not I have a

556
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,800
slight preference to two approaches that

557
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:22,290
use content and coding over what we're

558
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:27,050
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear about later but that may</font>

559
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:30,120
change based on later presentations okay

560
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:32,010
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this area this is we busy throw</font>

561
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:37,860
up our hands and gave up with this for

562
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:42,210
headers um and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean more or less</font>

563
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:43,770
right hum and so you know and that was

564
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,150
something that was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> really super</font>

565
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,500
high priority and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> burned an enormous</font>

566
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,470
amount of time on trying to get security

567
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,760
analysis up so just like I guess if

568
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,590
we're gonna be voting for whether we got

569
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,940
this I'm avoiding know until someone

570
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,340
shows me a paper that like demonstrates

571
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,350
is safe so i'm not i<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think we're</font>

572
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna ask for adoption today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well we're</font>

573
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,550
mostly putting it forward forward to see

574
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:04,020
if there's people in the room who'd be

575
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:06,389
willing to work with charles and others

576
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:08,850
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the problems in it right and</font>

577
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:11,850
so I certainly was not planning on

578
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:13,919
asking of the chairs first option but to

579
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:17,909
see where there's energy in the room to

580
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:19,620
work on this this class of<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem /</font>

581
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:21,720
approach so Ted we have another

582
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,800
presentation in the same general area

583
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's maybe we should go through that and</font>

584
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:28,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">then reeve it to this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> place out that</font>

585
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:28,370
have the bigger discussion yeah flat

586
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:43,170
yeah hi is left it's not from<font color="#CCCCCC"> cloud far</font>

587
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:46,980
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to lock my draft</font>

588
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:50,280
HTTP to<font color="#E5E5E5"> compression dictionary basically</font>

589
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:53,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is that you can use data from one</font>

590
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:55,770
HTTP to stream as a dictionary for

591
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:58,439
broadly<font color="#CCCCCC"> or deflate compression or any</font>

592
00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:00,330
other kind of compression even vc deve

593
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,000
compression is a dictionary for the

594
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:06,050
following<font color="#E5E5E5"> streams and that basically</font>

595
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,440
improves the aggression by significant

596
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:11,850
amount so we can also add them may be

597
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,730
static dictionaries to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> side</font>

598
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:17,280
proposal and basically what you do is

599
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,730
when you want to set a stream as a

600
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,350
dictionary you send

601
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:22,720
special frame called said dictionary

602
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:25,928
frame with the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for dead</font>

603
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,360
visionary and the client knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Ike</font>

604
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:31,270
need to keep part of the data for later

605
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:35,020
use and after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you just send use</font>

606
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:37,030
dictionary and you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that data as a</font>

607
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,639
visionary and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

608
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:42,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">also append several streams into a</font>

609
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:45,700
larger dictionary in that way you can

610
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:49,030
look into several previous file or

611
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:52,540
whatever and so the rationale is

612
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:55,030
obviously in it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in theory HTTP</font>

613
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:57,220
one use large assets and HTTP to use a

614
00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:00,700
smaller assets which is I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

615
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:02,230
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> true and but you know CPU time is</font>

616
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,059
getting significantly cheaper we

617
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:06,429
basically get two extra cords for the

618
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:08,860
same price every<font color="#CCCCCC"> year and the width</font>

619
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:10,450
cloth or use Jesus a dynamically

620
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:14,409
obviously no issues of that whatsoever

621
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:17,200
and next<font color="#E5E5E5"> year we're going to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

622
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:22,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">sky like cpu's with 50</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jays and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pjs</font>

623
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:26,740
can do very fast than any compassion and

624
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:29,530
you know today we see many new formats

625
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:32,080
like boldly in sandwich and there's a

626
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:33,700
CDN for example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to decide do</font>

627
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,699
you want to keep all those files in your

628
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,799
cash just in case one wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> gz points1</font>

629
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,510
broadly or you just you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know keep one</font>

630
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">copying and you just dynamically sir</font>

631
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:44,799
would ever come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> typing in and if</font>

632
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:50,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the approach then dictionaries</font>

633
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:53,799
improve compression ratio and so the

634
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:57,100
benefits are clear yeah with less waste

635
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:59,740
less bandwidth we see faster page loads

636
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:02,080
blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the special use cases</font>

637
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:04,270
for CDN again is when you do your origin

638
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,449
pool and you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> live persistent</font>

639
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:08,950
connection to the origin of HTTP to then

640
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:11,320
you can basically save a lot of

641
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:14,200
bandwidth with cloud where I have a tool

642
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:16,240
it's called railgun<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does n</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Delta</font>

643
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,730
compression to the origin<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

644
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">absolutely stunning and that's like if</font>

645
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:26,860
we standard like that it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a very</font>

646
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:28,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">very big use case and so just to give</font>

647
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,689
you some glimpse of the performance

648
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,650
we're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> here I did some analysis</font>

649
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:36,670
over to

650
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:38,260
thousand topple exercise well details

651
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:40,150
are not important but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

652
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:47,590
crawled over websites simulated the

653
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:49,690
dictionary compression a next and here

654
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:51,730
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lay the blue line</font>

655
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:54,550
that's the average compression<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

656
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:56,950
got over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 2,000 sides so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the blue</font>

657
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:59,320
line is very just load the website<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

658
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:02,770
the first time we can see there's like

659
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">over four percent improvement and that's</font>

660
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:07,150
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for music the static dictionaries</font>

661
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:10,240
that decorated but the orange line is

662
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:12,430
when there's like another click so you

663
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,710
load the next page on the same website

664
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:16,270
and then the compression goes up to

665
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:18,550
eighteen percent if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use large</font>

666
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:22,270
dictionaries that's with broadly dash 7

667
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:24,010
binary and if you do another click that

668
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:26,020
goes up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty-five percent and</font>

669
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:27,940
that's a crazy really crazy crush

670
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:31,690
improvement which five percent is

671
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:37,030
something you can get by just any other

672
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:41,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">algorithm and that's the media numbers</font>

673
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:42,670
are similar in next is a total again

674
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,560
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very similar we see almost</font>

675
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:48,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty-five percent for the total of</font>

676
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:51,399
those two thousand that we save next

677
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">ended by percentile we can see at the</font>

678
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:58,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">19th percentile the savings are fifty</font>

679
00:29:54,670 --> 00:30:00,730
percent which means we actually save 2x

680
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,830
it's a half the size of the original day

681
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:05,230
just thanks to using the dictionaries

682
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:07,570
and although I report<font color="#CCCCCC"> there seven</font>

683
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:10,450
numbers they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely the same for</font>

684
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:15,010
their five dish<font color="#E5E5E5"> six whatever it's it's</font>

685
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:18,070
very similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers and then here just</font>

686
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:22,560
an example if you go from deflate a che

687
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:25,060
to deflate dash for you just get<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1.0 for</font>

688
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:28,419
improvement and we do that because we

689
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:30,370
think that's worth it whereas<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you use</font>

690
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:34,210
dictionaries you get one point for this

691
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:39,010
XX at basically the same performance as

692
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:41,260
far as CPU concern next so the main

693
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:43,000
concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security like</font>

694
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:46,970
the previous

695
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:50,899
presentation and it's seriously it's

696
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:53,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard to really know if what we know</font>

697
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:56,739
today is even sufficient to estimate the

698
00:30:53,450 --> 00:31:01,399
performance implications of this

699
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:06,049
suggestion but at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we could</font>

700
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:10,090
give some tools to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client to to</font>

701
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:13,520
being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to disable on a pure / stream</font>

702
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:16,490
basis although also so I heard a

703
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:19,908
proposal to maybe use several a con

704
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:23,120
texts like<font color="#E5E5E5"> define for different streams</font>

705
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:25,700
which can or cannot be used to compress

706
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,830
in between and let the client decide

707
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,890
because the client has more data who's

708
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:34,220
the original of the of the request was

709
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:37,070
and basically the compression would be

710
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,169
disabled<font color="#CCCCCC"> by default so if you really</font>

711
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:41,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it you have to understand</font>

712
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:46,159
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing before you enable it</font>

713
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:49,789
and if you're an intermediary you also

714
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:52,580
use it to less you can told you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

715
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:56,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">reminder today most websites are non</font>

716
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:58,730
https websites and they really at least

717
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you give them more incentive to be</font>

718
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:03,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">HTTPS it's better than plain text I</font>

719
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:07,370
guess maybe maybe not everyone would

720
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:10,909
agree it's my opinion and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some websites</font>

721
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:12,559
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really don't don't have that data</font>

722
00:32:10,909 --> 00:32:14,929
that would be compromised such

723
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:20,240
compression and we I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should let</font>

724
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:22,580
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least enjoy the benefits next so</font>

725
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:27,200
another question was how it compares to

726
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:28,610
the previous and visitation so that's

727
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,890
not a competition that's completely

728
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:32,350
different use cases sin which is great

729
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:35,899
when you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> download a big dictionary</font>

730
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:39,500
ahead of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> or out of band and there</font>

731
00:32:35,899 --> 00:32:42,770
we also explore this use case for<font color="#E5E5E5"> n</font>

732
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:46,640
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proposal can work</font>

733
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:51,379
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> vcd obviously also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a dictionary</font>

734
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:53,539
and if you compress with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> visit of</font>

735
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:55,159
before and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then use broadly for example</font>

736
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:57,050
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> christian compression you obviously</font>

737
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:59,670
will gain more

738
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:01,409
obviously you don't need it there's very

739
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:03,030
little overhead you just send several

740
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:06,120
bites to set<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dictionary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and several</font>

741
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:07,710
bites to use it and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

742
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,600
use the whole layer stream as a

743
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:11,610
dictionary or the whole life asset just

744
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,260
some first bites because those are the

745
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:16,530
important for an area the creation of

746
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:18,420
the window also we've seen much better

747
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:20,220
compression ratio in the use case where

748
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:22,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do use Christian compression for</font>

749
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:24,780
broadly than for sandwich broadening and

750
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:29,280
the creators of broadly<font color="#E5E5E5"> also support</font>

751
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:32,700
this a statement so yeah you can append

752
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:35,129
streams together which means you have

753
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,800
better efficiency and also because

754
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:40,110
you're at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> HP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to layer you know which</font>

755
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:43,440
data was sent you know exactly what the

756
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:45,229
client has you can use dictionaries much

757
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,600
more efficiently than you can do on the

758
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:54,750
HTTP layer or on the application layer

759
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:57,409
and again minimal overhead next also not

760
00:33:54,750 --> 00:34:00,360
very important but you can also do X

761
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:03,260
more optimizations to their current

762
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:05,699
broadly<font color="#CCCCCC"> or deflate implementations to</font>

763
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:16,110
make it even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more efficient than it is</font>

764
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:18,929
today Landon yes so seriously i'm making

765
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:21,149
an opt-in is interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean one way</font>

field sandwich right when we do tackle

768
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,000
these side channel attacks would be to

769
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,649
attempt to narrow the range of things

770
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,168
that could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be compressed to things that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we thought were somehow safe um so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">would actually not work but you might</font>

785
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:00,390
that the attacker manages to basically

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,740
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> you make a request on his behalf</font>

788
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,830
they've ambient authority right so I'm

789
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,270
stripping cooking is what might might

790
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,840
work for that I don't know I don't know

791
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,340
what fashion of

792
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:14,740
things that would effectively break um

793
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:16,510
um so I don't know I guess my the reason

794
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:18,759
I got up was um because I thought that

795
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:20,910
everything else I've heard about defense

796
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,290
is as large<font color="#CCCCCC"> made about oh how do we like</font>

797
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,609
how do we handcuff the compression

798
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:26,259
mechanism enough that it can't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font>

799
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,850
as I channel and so I thought was

800
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,140
interesting you suggested instead of it

801
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:30,490
is it of handcuffing question<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

802
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:32,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a limiting the times you use it and</font>

803
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,580
if we're gonna adopt something like this

804
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,440
probably that seems are the most

805
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,150
attractive venue for for protecting

806
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,070
ourselves from it because I i I'm I'm

807
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:40,480
extremely pessimistic about our ability

808
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:46,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">to design a person ski Mitchell's</font>

809
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:48,670
Manhattan side channels ok now I I'd

810
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:51,910
like to point out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this approach I</font>

811
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:55,570
would also<font color="#E5E5E5"> benefit our for two would be</font>

812
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:58,000
a benefit to people using web api is

813
00:35:55,570 --> 00:36:01,060
across datacenters because it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

814
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,330
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to compress many smaller I mean</font>

815
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:07,750
tiny requests and responses and in such

816
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:10,630
cases it's often hard to build a shed

817
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:12,730
dictionary ahead of time so isn't this

818
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:15,640
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dynamic approach might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

819
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:17,650
beneficial I think yeah one last<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I</font>

820
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:21,100
test it was when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> type in google</font>

821
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:23,320
search every character e-type you get a

822
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:39,819
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON file and that's very beneficial</font>

823
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:43,750
nephews case for example if I want to

824
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:46,560
parole yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jenelle sounds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

825
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:56,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion either ones right for</font>

826
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:57,540
adoption so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just it is ok stuff so</font>

827
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:59,850
uh

828
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:01,529
I suppose anchor so insights like

829
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">CloudFlare you guys have multiple</font>

830
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:05,520
different domains on the same connection

831
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,260
and you have a giant search with all the

832
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,180
domains in them so are you not worried

833
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,280
about the connection coalescing effects

834
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:13,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">of browsers and how this works with ya</font>

835
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,350
smoothly that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we will</font>

836
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:19,010
let the browser decide if they will

837
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:21,600
allow or not allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> crossing compression</font>

838
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:24,120
they might indicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one website</font>

839
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,880
will have context zero dollar will have

840
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:30,029
context one and we'll just use cross

841
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,790
steering between those websites right

842
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:35,190
but the property is that the websites

843
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:39,029
would want to opt into this right like

844
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:40,980
so I don't the websites would want to

845
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,270
say that hey I don't want to share a

846
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,660
stream I don't want to share a

847
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:47,310
dictionary with another another psychic

848
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,770
even though I'm running on same like

849
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:52,460
connection as another side duties I hope

850
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:55,320
being hosted on CD and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope they don't</font>

851
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:58,820
use assets they don't trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

852
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:00,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">but yeah also something to consider</font>

853
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,790
button times I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the simplest thing</font>

854
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:06,000
in here is to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is</font>

855
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:07,830
constrained<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an origin and yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

856
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,300
the luck around initially I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

857
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:13,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best approach in the safe as well</font>

858
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:17,040
and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see from there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

859
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:18,960
thanks flat it sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we still need</font>

860
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have discussions on both of these</font>

861
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,700
approaches and how they might be used

862
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,020
and what the impact would be so I think

863
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just want to encourage folks to</font>

864
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:31,610
continue that well we're all here as

865
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:31,610
well as on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> list well that make sense</font>

866
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:43,890
sabar borough you can speak to Mike oh

867
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:46,770
nice oh do I get to press a button Craig

868
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:50,430
can you is it Greg Pratt can can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

869
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:51,930
um do whatever it is in the Miguel co-op

870
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:57,569
that you need to do make yourself known

871
00:38:51,930 --> 00:39:01,109

872
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:03,750
and now I get to press the red button

873
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:11,290
that's two times in two sessions mark

874
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:17,230
and though<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know hello oh hi um this is</font>

875
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:20,140
craig Pratt I'm I'm presenting on on the

876
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:22,420
live<font color="#CCCCCC"> random-access CR but you'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> notice</font>

877
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:25,540
that both Barbara and I'm not Barbara by

878
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:27,820
the way first of all Barbara<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> darsh</font>

879
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:29,680
acarbose there but there's they must

880
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:32,260
believe in my presentation skills so

881
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,629
much that they're having me do this

882
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:38,920
remotely or they're smart enough to know

883
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:40,900
that uh they said uh this is a topic

884
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,390
that that's somebody else should be

885
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:48,100
presenting who's not there anyway I'm i

886
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:52,770
heard you of my slides handy<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did not</font>

887
00:39:48,100 --> 00:40:00,339
receive your slides so now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't um</font>

888
00:39:52,770 --> 00:40:04,509
hmm we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up resolution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can go</font>

889
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:12,359
baby can I present remotely present look

890
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:16,330
good i used we have 10 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so sure</font>

891
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:20,220
okay so why<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go off and we'll</font>

892
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:23,290
swap the sessions around so next up is

893
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:24,939
think Takashi do you have your super

894
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,980
info just give you the tunnel uh yeah

895
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:34,869
give me the dongle then you can do that

896
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:43,660
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the background just a second oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

897
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:46,030
it's comma y de moment I'm taka see from

898
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:50,649
chromium<font color="#CCCCCC"> James I'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

899
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:55,210
kind of how to evolve the<font color="#CCCCCC"> WebSocket and</font>

900
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:59,320
maybe as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> net web messaging and hepg2</font>

901
00:40:55,210 --> 00:41:06,040
era so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of one possible</font>

902
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:08,260
solution for this kind of questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

903
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:12,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">I could just start with talking about</font>

904
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:16,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">the history so with on lips shift will</font>

905
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:19,460

906
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:22,460
sorry Raymond<font color="#CCCCCC"> I also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get to others she</font>

913
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:51,110
about the api's imparted to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> web</font>

914
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">socket so so one thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> either talk about</font>

915
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:57,260
is a we've been actively working on the

916
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:01,009
Fitch API and streams API which is kind

917
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:03,970
of a successor objects HR API which is

918
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:07,040
very legacy and cannot handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of</font>

919
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:09,890
answer to the lot of the demands<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

920
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,140
such as streamed uploading downloading

921
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:15,620
and kind of Rudy plex messaging<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

922
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:19,100
that so but we are kind of going to

923
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:22,400
dissolve all the discs issued by these

924
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:26,410
api's this kind of actively shipped and

925
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:29,560
being evolved to solve these issues and

926
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:33,020
so we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of sporadically</font>

927
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:37,400
having some discussion about how we

928
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:41,870
should have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web socket for the HCP</font>

929
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:46,100
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> eras should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be like so we've in 2013</font>

930
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:49,400
we've tackled this problem by kinda

931
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:53,060
trying to introduce some<font color="#CCCCCC"> WebSocket</font>

932
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:57,550
mapping to<font color="#E5E5E5"> http two frames directory or</font>

933
00:42:53,060 --> 00:43:02,840
just layering the WebSocket one point

934
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:09,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">WebSocket 1.0 just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dev 20 on to the the</font>

00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:11,270
stream of<font color="#CCCCCC"> hcp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so here's</font>

936
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:13,850
some data so we are still having this<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

937
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:17,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">WebSocket</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> above showing the based on the</font>

938
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:21,319
user matrix analysis of chromium about

939
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:23,720
0.7 percent of web pages visited are

940
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:26,290
using the web socket so I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

941
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:28,029
think about this as a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

942
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:30,490
adoption

943
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:33,460
and which we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> just take care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

944
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:39,279
this for the recipe to era so next<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

945
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:41,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">please so in the last almost two years</font>

946
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,870
now we've been discussing what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right</font>

947
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:47,440
thing to do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is one solution i</font>

948
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:51,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">propose and me and when boys proposing</font>

949
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:54,340
so that is a this kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> introduced a</font>

950
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:57,160
new frame types so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just say that</font>

951
00:43:54,340 --> 00:44:00,430
this isn't a new media type but is based

952
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:03,430
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> web socket framing but dropping</font>

953
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:06,609
all the transport layer stuff such as a

<font color="#E5E5E5">ping pong signaling go across signaling</font>

955
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:12,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes and some scenes and unnecessary</font>

956
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:15,670
such as a masking which we've introduced

957
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:20,500
for the because of the Cross podkova

958
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:23,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">tacking on exact but just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a WebSocket</font>

959
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:25,810
framing as a we already have a lot of

960
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:28,480
library and<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sub a framework</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

961
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:32,100
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a WebSocket encoding such</font>

962
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:37,240
as the links code links header like that

963
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:42,390
but we don't introduce any new mapping

964
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:46,439
or kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> internship designs using the</font>

965
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:50,350
HTTP to layer stuff but just keep us

966
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:53,080
just inside the HTTP 1.1 semantics so I

967
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:57,580
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we use this this framing</font>

968
00:44:53,080 --> 00:45:03,850
inside the HTTP response and request

969
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:06,370
body<font color="#CCCCCC"> message body dead part so I've</font>

970
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:12,299
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduced this as a media type</font>

971
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:16,210
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> user for the story for the web</font>

972
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:19,060
programming would be using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:21,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sapien of each API to do streamed</font>

974
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:24,850
uploading<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data and receiving of data</font>

975
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:28,810
and possibly that could be just too

976
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:34,839
depressed to be almost equivalent to the

977
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:37,480
fat WebSocket can do and the story could

978
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:40,390
be so I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just talk a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

979
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,860
what we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing for the streams API so</font>

980
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:43,690
we had

981
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:47,320
finally double side on the lighter side

982
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:52,800
of stream<font color="#E5E5E5"> API which is kind of going to</font>

983
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:55,570
represent the sink and source of data

984
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:59,830
will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lapid lapped by these interfaces</font>

985
00:45:55,570 --> 00:46:02,140
and we also introducing a concept named

986
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:04,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the transform stream that is kind of</font>

987
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:07,299
connecting the disk readable and

988
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:10,180
writable stuff with a transform stream

989
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:13,750
that could implement such as a diff rate

990
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:18,910
being a stream or JSON encoding and

991
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:21,220
parcel or horrible that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so I mean</font>

992
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:23,470
that this kind of framing could be also

993
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:27,399
implemented in the former but this

994
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:31,089
transform stream concept so the first

995
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:34,810
step could be introducing that transform

996
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:38,740
stream 400 wish protocol and framing and

997
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:41,710
then so as we buy the compatibility with

998
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:43,899
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> WebSocket as we have a lot of the</font>

999
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:49,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">already deployed WebSocket stuff and</font>

1000
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:53,680
asset so we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just proceed to bind</font>

1001
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:55,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">the web socket API with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wish and hep-2</font>

1002
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,390
and together with some fallback

1003
00:46:55,810 --> 00:47:01,270
mechanism or sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nice handshake or</font>

1004
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:04,980
something and then estero<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:13,480
easily migrate to this stock so

1007
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:17,560
WebSocket wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> over HTTP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to so that's a</font>

1008
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:19,930
story we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are kind of sitting and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

1009
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:22,420
to also mention that you know going to

1010
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:24,910
take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a bunch of the WebSocket</font>

1011
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:28,420
compatibility stuff so not only the

1012
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:31,330
framing but the people are heavier using

1013
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:33,550
the sub protocol systems which<font color="#E5E5E5"> will so</font>

1014
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:36,340
get one point their heart that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font>

1015
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:39,340
of proposing allowing the client to

1016
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:44,410
offer the proper protocol candidates to

1017
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:48,130
to be used and the Saba responds with a

1018
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:51,220
chosen prod sub protocol so this is this

1019
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:55,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens inside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the WebSocket semantics</font>

1020
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:58,839
but we could just implement this in the

1021
00:47:55,269 --> 00:48:01,629
form of the HTTP 1.1 semantics such as

1022
00:47:58,839 --> 00:48:04,089
the one proposed way is using the accept

1023
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:07,539
header and content type hitter to

1024
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:10,089
declare the proper offered some

1025
00:48:07,539 --> 00:48:12,880
protocols and our other<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sabha to choose</font>

1026
00:48:10,089 --> 00:48:16,149
one and this respond in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the form of the</font>

1027
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:19,539
content type effect so not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1028
00:48:16,149 --> 00:48:22,868
topic but we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been discussing how we</font>

1029
00:48:19,539 --> 00:48:25,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">should a guarantees a kind of enough</font>

1030
00:48:22,869 --> 00:48:28,929
compatibility with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web socket but</font>

1031
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:31,869
almost all the answers we cut recurrent

1032
00:48:28,929 --> 00:48:35,019
hub have been summarized into the idea

1033
00:48:31,869 --> 00:48:37,989
we published for this meeting so I'd

1034
00:48:35,019 --> 00:48:41,919
love to you you to take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

1035
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:45,459
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> and give us some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feedback</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and your</font>

1036
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:47,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">opinion about the wizard this makes</font>

1037
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:50,769
sense for the British of the WebSocket

1038
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:54,429
was a tp2 and possibly quick or some

1039
00:48:50,769 --> 00:48:56,709
more pho protocol layering so that's it

1040
00:48:54,429 --> 00:48:58,449
so take a ship we've only got like three

1041
00:48:56,709 --> 00:49:00,098
minutes for tournaments but I'm actually

1042
00:48:58,449 --> 00:49:10,019
very curious how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people have read</font>

1043
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:14,380
this draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think yeah summarize</font>

1044
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:15,879
three or four yeah Martin yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mountain</font>

1045
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:20,909
Thompson is this just service and events

1046
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:20,909
on crack support<font color="#E5E5E5"> with server sent events</font>

1047
00:49:21,329 --> 00:49:28,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok since since the past um so service</font>

1048
00:49:26,949 --> 00:49:30,849
and events looks very much like what

1049
00:49:28,209 --> 00:49:32,319
you're describing ah<font color="#CCCCCC"> WebSockets was</font>

1050
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:34,809
intended to replace service and events

1051
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:39,429
yeah now we're sort of coming full

1052
00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:41,349
circle so I the caution that this has

1053
00:49:39,429 --> 00:49:45,219
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> poor latency properties in certain</font>

1054
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:46,809
circumstances and service and events had

1055
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:49,929
bunch of other problems that this

1056
00:49:46,809 --> 00:49:53,049
potentially suffers from as well yeah it

1057
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:57,909
kind of yet absolutely brilliant cut in

1058
00:49:53,049 --> 00:50:00,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">contrast to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issues but the and this</font>

1059
00:49:57,909 --> 00:50:03,869
guy as I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though considering</font>

1060
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:08,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's also issues we should proceed with</font>

1061
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:11,470
this pass and yeah

1062
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:13,840
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're we're just about</font>

1063
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:15,640
out of time for this one I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

1064
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,650
there's maybe two threads here one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1065
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:20,650
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the general future if any or the</font>

1066
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:22,450
evolution of web sockets and it's not at

1067
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:24,280
all clear to us as chairs that this

1068
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:26,230
working group is the right place with

1069
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:29,170
that discussion to happen I think good

1070
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:31,630
nodding and then the other discussion is

1071
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:34,240
if that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> future evolution of</font>

1072
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:36,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">WebSockets has a relationship with HTTP</font>

1073
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,759
in some fashion what should that look

1074
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:42,640
like and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe the next step for this</font>

1075
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:45,400
might be a barb off or a separate list

1076
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:47,859
or resurrecting the old<font color="#E5E5E5"> web sockets list</font>

1077
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:50,230
or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I by I guess it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was I keep</font>

1078
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:52,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting told to go to dispatch yeah</font>

1079
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:54,910
dispatches<font color="#CCCCCC"> my supplies yeah and we can</font>

1080
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:57,070
have that discussion there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank</font>

1081
00:50:54,910 --> 00:51:00,609
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the presentation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ring</font>

1082
00:50:57,070 --> 00:51:02,440
Craig back uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eureka I'm Craig I'm so</font>

1083
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:07,660
sorry your presentation was classified

1084
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:08,980
as spam by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gmail oh he asks a request um</font>

1085
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:13,930
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the queue I think me the dog</font>

1086
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:15,130
back Oh jungle yes I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna try</font>

1087
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:20,589
pressing the button anyway okay here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1088
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:24,970
go awesome hello did I say spam okay Wow

1089
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:28,590
okay um I'll try to make this quick to

1090
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:35,319
be technical gmail called it spam not me

1091
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:37,120
okay no no problem um okay so go ahead

1092
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:39,820
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> go forward a slide here so this is a</font>

1093
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:42,730
pretty few people have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been down this</font>

1094
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:45,220
road and no one has survived but

1095
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:48,340
basically was it seems like a pretty

1096
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:50,770
simple problem that no one has has quite

1097
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:55,090
figured out the right answer to how do

1098
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:59,110
you have a live or continuously

1099
00:51:55,090 --> 00:52:02,320
aggregating resource which you can also

1100
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:05,560
support random access on using a range

1101
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:08,080
requests um so there's a number of

1102
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:10,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">examples of this I come at this from a</font>

1103
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:12,730
video angle but there's lots of there's

1104
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:15,480
more it seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more examples</font>

1105
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:20,530
now than there have been in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past</font>

1106
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:22,090
anyway next slide please<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so here's</font>

1107
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:25,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">the basic problem</font>

1108
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:30,430
in a bite range spec last<font color="#E5E5E5"> bite position</font>

1109
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:32,589
is optional but in in a response you

1110
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:35,730
must provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> a last bite position which</font>

1111
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:43,780
implies that a partial content is a

1112
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:49,120
bounded is a bounded response body<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1113
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:50,920
next slide please so here's some of the

1114
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:53,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that have been considered this</font>

1115
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:57,220
isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even all of them just changing the</font>

1116
00:52:53,890 --> 00:53:01,930
a be enough for the bites range unit and

1117
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:04,209
hope to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not blow up too many things new</font>

1118
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:06,790
range unit for a lot for live this is

1119
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:10,030
what the current draft was that this

1120
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:13,300
time was allocated for we've allowed

1121
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:18,250
that to expire I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is qualifies</font>

1122
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:20,140
in the two rusted to be usable and Roger

1123
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:21,900
combs also demonstrated there's a

1124
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:24,640
variety<font color="#CCCCCC"> of software that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't handle</font>

1125
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:28,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">except ranges with anything other than</font>

1126
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:30,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">bites and none in them so now we have a</font>

1127
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:33,250
another option which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really the</font>

1128
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:37,029
fourth option that's been proposed down

1129
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:39,970
this path which was late submission my

1130
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:45,160
apologies for that next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> please</font>

1131
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:50,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">will this is pretty simple the concept</font>

1132
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:52,420
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that the client can pass a vote</font>

1133
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:56,470
voice some of this formatting got messed

1134
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:59,470
up my apologies for that that basically

1135
00:53:56,470 --> 00:54:00,910
the client well there's two there's two

1136
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:03,339
important things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> client who's</font>

1137
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:06,640
dealing with with live content needs to

1138
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:10,210
know it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know first of all it's</font>

1139
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:12,850
live and secondly it also needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

1140
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:15,040
where is the point where where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop</font>

1141
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:18,580
where I can still randomly access

1142
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:20,380
content without getting flow controlled

1143
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:25,120
by the production<font color="#E5E5E5"> of content on the</font>

1144
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:26,790
server so currently the open-ended bite

1145
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:31,660
bite request serves that purpose

1146
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:34,690
perfectly if I do<font color="#CCCCCC"> byte 0 dash it the</font>

1147
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:35,540
server gleefully gives me back the

1148
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:39,530
current

1149
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:41,540
range and then the star is a good

1150
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:46,220
indicator that the representation length

1151
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:49,520
is unknown but the what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> proposing</font>

1152
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:52,040
here is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> possibility of using instead</font>

1153
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:54,670
instead of changing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a B and F well</font>

1154
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:57,259
let's work inside the current a BNF and

1155
00:54:54,670 --> 00:55:01,430
just say let's just say well what if the

1156
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:04,370
client uses a very large number instead

1157
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:07,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">of star or some other mechanism that</font>

1158
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:10,100
requires a new BNF in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1159
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:12,529
the this the client would would pass

1160
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:15,860
some very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large number that this in this</font>

1161
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:17,980
case it's this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 to the 64th or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 22</font>

1162
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:20,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">63rd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that</font>

1163
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:24,320
something that's hopefully pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

1164
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:27,080
to parse the if the client sees in the

1165
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">response that same number back see the</font>

1166
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:31,700
equals equals that supposed to have a

1167
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:34,009
bubble<font color="#E5E5E5"> around it then it knows hey this</font>

1168
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:38,569
is a server that<font color="#E5E5E5"> understands how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1169
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:42,890
return me a live response that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

1170
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:45,110
that's the clients indicator that it can

1171
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:46,460
that it can do random access so at this

1172
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:50,060
point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time at the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

1173
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:51,890
exchange the server knows well the

1174
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:56,540
client knows where is the randomly

1175
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:58,879
accessible content end 9440<font color="#E5E5E5"> 83 83 and it</font>

1176
00:55:56,540 --> 00:56:03,470
also knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's live content that</font>

1177
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:05,180
can provide unbounded range responses so

1178
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:06,799
in response that you can see here it's

1179
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:08,569
actually providing a response that

1180
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:11,210
starts earlier than the random access

1181
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:13,900
point for instance to establish the

1182
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:16,430
beginning of framing in the content and

1183
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:22,130
it wants a it wants a response that's

1184
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:25,040
unbounded next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide please a current</font>

1185
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:27,860
server that doesn't understand any of

1186
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:30,080
this will when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide a number</font>

1187
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:32,450
that's too large and out of bounds will

1188
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:34,759
simply give you back just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like with the</font>

1189
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:39,140
open and arrange<font color="#CCCCCC"> request will give you</font>

1190
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:41,240
back some some smaller number that

1191
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:42,710
represents the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> balance now it's</font>

1192
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:44,600
important to notice between<font color="#E5E5E5"> these two</font>

1193
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:47,090
with live content it's common for this

1194
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:50,049
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be going up continuously so</font>

1195
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:54,440
here we were at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 99 for</font>

1196
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:56,360
083 83 in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> were at 99 for 1000 but</font>

1197
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:57,650
the important thing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client is hey</font>

1198
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,990
wait a minute this guy didn't give me

1199
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:01,240
back the same large number therefore he

1200
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:05,120
doesn't understand anything about

1201
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:07,910
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with large unbounded range</font>

1202
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:10,130
responses and live content<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna</font>

1203
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:11,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">treat him just like I'm gonna I'm gonna</font>

1204
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:19,700
have to do this some other way polling

1205
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:24,770
or some other mechanism um next slide so

1206
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:31,629
that's it um hope that was fast enough

1207
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:31,630
any any thoughts on this nice and fast

1208
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:41,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the last slide the example</font>

1209
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:44,360
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sabah that doesn't know about</font>

1210
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:48,319
this wouldn't it return range not

1211
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:53,030
satisfiable in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> only it's only</font>

1212
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:54,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">if the start of the range it ranged nuts</font>

1213
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:56,570
has filed was reserved before when

1214
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:59,000
there's zero overlap so as long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1215
00:57:56,570 --> 00:58:02,540
start of the range is before the end of

1216
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,190
the range the accessible content range

1217
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:08,990
you should be getting a partial content

1218
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:11,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">according to RFC ok we'll wrote that</font>

1219
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:12,770
yeah some mutton<font color="#CCCCCC"> thompson this</font>

1220
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:14,060
understanding the constraints we're

1221
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:17,560
operating under this doesn't seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all</font>

1222
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:21,290
crazy it's awful high praise indeed um

1223
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:23,000
but this is this is this actually looks

1224
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:25,960
workable which is the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I've</font>

1225
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,680
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that in this area</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1226
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:30,950
congratulations thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for coming up</font>

1227
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:33,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">with something clever yes indeed um well</font>

1228
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:36,200
you have to we have to thank Patrick for

1229
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:37,460
some inspiration on this one I don't

1230
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:40,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly what he had in</font>

1231
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:42,520
mind but it's close I think to something

1232
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:46,430
he has yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cygnus does I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

1233
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:48,560
so I I think it's also a problem that

1234
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:51,649
some people are having that it's really

1235
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:53,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">annoying and so I have no problem with</font>

1236
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:56,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">proceeding with something like this so I</font>

1237
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,290
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question is is is that I</font>

1238
00:58:56,120 --> 00:59:01,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't had a chance to look at the</font>

1239
00:58:57,290 --> 00:59:02,660
draft is it you know just documenting a

1240
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:05,560
pattern of use it doesn't

1241
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:07,879
any new protocol elements here well

1242
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:10,279
there's definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> an understanding here</font>

1243
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:15,620
between client and server I don't know

1244
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:17,630
how we characterize it exactly but so

1245
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:19,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Chicago Caleb's I think that our</font>

1246
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:21,860
hope here is to actually probably

1247
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:24,440
publish it as a informational RFC or

1248
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:25,670
something so that everybody kind of

1249
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,620
starts using it this way hopefully

1250
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:29,660
whoever wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use so my suggestion</font>

1251
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:31,880
would be we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more people to read the</font>

1252
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:34,549
draft and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a call for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adoption on</font>

1253
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:36,400
the list I think so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> can I mike</font>

1254
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:39,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">bishop can I just clarify one thing is</font>

1255
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,780
the exceptionally large number is that a

1256
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">magic number or does the client just</font>

1257
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:46,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">make something yeah I thought about</font>

1258
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:48,560
using a magic number but right now it's

1259
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:51,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">the client can pick whatever it likes I</font>

1260
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:55,310
thought magic number was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just too too</font>

1261
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:58,490
gross but i was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to to to</font>

1262
00:59:55,310 --> 01:00:01,220
to the 63rd to 263 minus 42 or something

1263
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:03,140
like that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be great but no it's a</font>

1264
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:06,200
client's choice that what's important is

1265
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:08,870
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Equality test on the previous slide</font>

1266
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:12,830
so the server basically acknowledges if

1267
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:16,029
its support by returning<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same number</font>

1268
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:18,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">back we're gonna kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cues now yeah</font>

1269
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:21,170
there's no need for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a magic number here</font>

1270
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:23,990
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is fine there is</font>

1271
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:27,680
potentially a sort of interaction here

1272
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:31,399
where the client a client that receives

1273
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:33,669
a response in this form that doesn't

1274
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:37,760
realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's made this request</font>

1275
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:42,470
could they pick up<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they pick a large</font>

1276
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:45,440
number and that comes echoed back and if

1277
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:48,049
they if they weren't implementing this

1278
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:50,180
spec a server<font color="#E5E5E5"> that does implement this</font>

1279
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:52,370
spec could end up confusing the client

1280
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:55,730
years ago that is that is that is the

1281
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:57,859
hazard so um we're at a time oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1282
01:00:55,730 --> 01:01:00,800
yeah we're out of time sorry we might

1283
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:03,470
mention once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I give this info yeah right</font>

1284
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,670
my only<font color="#E5E5E5"> question now is you know it</font>

1285
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:06,470
sounds like people want this to be

1286
