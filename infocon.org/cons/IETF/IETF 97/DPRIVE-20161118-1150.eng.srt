just touch on them here they're both

153
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,910

<font color="#CCCCCC">that be a must shouldn't you make</font>

162
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:53,319

get the draft

has the upper texting should and the

165
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:03,400
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the list was why isn't that</font>

166
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:05,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">a must the answer was the draft has</font>

167
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,300
written this way to leave clients some

168
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:09,610
flexibility because for example if they

169
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,500
are configured with many upstream

170
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,630
recursos what that would force them to

171
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,790
do is try<font color="#E5E5E5"> every single one of them to</font>

172
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:19,270
get an authenticated connection before

173
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,800
it could actually do dinner service and

<font color="#E5E5E5">so if we're going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't go down a</font>

178
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:31,900
taking the latency hit so it would be

179
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,760
really good to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> feedback on which of</font>

180
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:39,160
these directions a working group would

181
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:42,270
prefer the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is that the</font>

182
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,680
way the draft is currently written it

183
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:47,010
allows for all the possible outcomes of

184
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:51,160
opportunistic as described in the

185
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:53,490
opportunistic RFC which is 73 54 there

186
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:57,640
is a paragraph in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that draft that says</font>

187
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:59,440
opportunistic clients may hard fail and

188
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,670
such it says if they believe there's a

189
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,680
really good reason they should be able

190
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:05,829
to authenticate so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if a</font>

191
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:08,770
server has advertised potentials and it

192
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:11,560
has them it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the possibility</font>

193
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:14,170
of heart failure so this is enumerated

194
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:17,530
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft again the question was is</font>

195
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:20,890
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really valuable in a DNS context or</font>

196
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:23,050
is it just much simpler to keep this

197
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,970
simple take heart failure out and say

198
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,589
opportunistic clients always always go

199
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,910
back to clear text to get service

200
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:30,220
because people who chooses profile

201
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:35,290
really want to use actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

202
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:38,320
dns responses the the small want one

small case that I'd sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of seen that</font>

204
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,640
that paragraph aloud was for example I'm

205
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,040
an opportunistic client I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

206
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,310
credentials I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a server</font>

207
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,780
authenticate I do 100 connections and

208
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:52,000
they will authenticate and then one

209
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:54,730
stops the next one the authentication

210
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,370
fails so that's an indication

211
00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:00,700
something's wrong as a client I might

212
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:05,320
decide to act on that and not continuous

213
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:07,100
service although the flip side of that

214
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,200
is well it could just be

215
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,030
if get expired or something went wrong

216
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,050
I'm opportunistic I should carry on

217
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:17,089
anyway so again feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> on whether that</font>

218
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:21,740
hard fail really make sense a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS would</font>

219
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:25,730
be would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> great just to reiterate</font>

220
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:30,080
there is an implementation of this draft

221
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:32,510
in stubby which is the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> demon mode</font>

222
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,730
of get dns which has the NSF a TLS

223
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:36,020
what's implemented in that is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> option</font>

224
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,180
to pick either a strict or an

225
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:41,840
opportunistic profile and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can also</font>

226
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:45,920
configure a name or an SP code pin set

227
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:49,280
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the basis for authentication art so</font>

228
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,490
lastly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I apologies couldn't resist all</font>

229
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:56,300
the other protocols did it so and Dennis

230
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:58,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't but seriously what I really think</font>

231
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">we would like to do today is get some</font>

232
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,740
consensus on moving the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft forward</font>

233
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:06,860
it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last big piece left in</font>

234
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,650
terms of the recursive do stub picture

235
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,810
and it's slightly stalled at the moment

236
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:13,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">so if we could possibly even get</font>

237
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,540
volunteers from the room to commit to

238
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,640
reviewing this that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be great</font>

239
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,380
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try and</font>

240
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,270
define an<font color="#CCCCCC"> end point for the last call</font>

241
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,770
and how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move that forward so that's</font>

242
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:26,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">the requested to the working group today</font>

243
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:28,340
I think that's it is everything

244
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:33,800
questions comments on either of the

245

<font color="#CCCCCC">the choice of must should I think that</font>

247
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:40,790
it's not too big a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it</font>

248
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:43,970
does not it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not create problem for</font>

interoperable Intel operability because

in all<font color="#E5E5E5"> case it's only local policy</font>

actually the most should hear in that

interoperability<font color="#E5E5E5"> their advice that we</font>

259
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:12,680
give so what we could do is just to say

00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,390
okay here are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the possible choices here</font>

261
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,420
are the consequence functions a

262
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:20,300
consequence of strict is you may not

263
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:22,579
have any DNS service in the

264
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">case a consequence of opportunistic is</font>

265
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:28,960
you may be in the queue and be exposed

266
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:32,240
cetera on so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should not in my opinion</font>

267
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,400
argue too much about Muslim should in

268
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,370
this case because they have no Intel

269
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:40,720
probability consequences so don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry</font>

272
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:52,180
I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> reviewed it yes I will but you</font>

273
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,040
have a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of open questions that I</font>

274
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:57,339
think I'm the cause of some of them so I

275
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">promise to re-review it if other people</font>

276
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:02,380
will review it and I won't do it if you

277
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:05,829
don't um on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two questions um I think</font>

278
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mus should question on this is</font>

279
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:09,430
only about opportunistic and I think

280
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,310
you've already done a good enough job in

281
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,719
the earlier sections on telling people

282
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,719
how to choose between strict and

283
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,210
opportunistic so an opportunistic

284
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,760
someone doing opportunistic who wants to

285
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:24,700
be strict like didn't understand the

286
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,610
earlier text they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be stripped so</font>

287
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,230
your example of a actually this is on

288
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,110
the next one so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the current one</font>

289
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:34,540
is fine but on the going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to clear text</font>

290
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,250
your example of well what if they've

291
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,990
connected hundred times and now they

292
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,760
notice this they're not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

293
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,910
opportunistic if in fact they're

294
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,680
noticing this and they're logging this

295
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:46,390
they really are being they're acting

296
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,729
like they're strict they should be

297
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:51,580
choosing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the strict profile and again I</font>

298
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:53,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">think you did that fine before so I</font>

299
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,060
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> these two questions are sort of</font>

300
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,279
for people who are choosing

301
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:00,310
opportunistic but they didn't understand

302
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,110
it so in this case I would absolutely

303
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:03,550
say should fall back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear text</font>

304
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,680
there's absolutely no reason to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fall</font>

305
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:07,329
know if you've chosen opportunistic not

306
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,310
to fall back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear text we don't have</font>

307
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:12,850
an indicator for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if someone</font>

308
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:15,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">was at an indicator if someone's paying</font>

309
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,870
it if the human or the system is paying

310
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">attention the indicator they probably</font>

311
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:23,170
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be stripped so I I believe</font>

312
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:25,000
both of these are be liberal because

313
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,319
we're talking opportunistic not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

314
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">because we've defined strict but we've</font>

315
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,220
also told people how to choose between

316
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:32,260
them so you're suggesting leaflet as a

317
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:36,640
shirt and remove<font color="#E5E5E5"> heart fail as an option</font>

318
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:40,029
absolutely hi this is Daniel<font color="#CCCCCC"> Congo more</font>

319
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:43,839
so um I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the scenario that you</font>

320
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:45,370
described<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sarah that says I you know</font>

321
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,779
make the<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection for a hundred times</font>

322
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,000
and then at that point suddenly

323
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:51,490
something fails I think you're

324
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,350
describing a client that maybe learns to

325
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,630
move from opportunistic district or

326
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,130
something like that

327
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,290
right that may not be a strictly

328
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:01,189
opportunistic strictly off in it sorry

329
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:04,260
that may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a purely opportunistic</font>

330
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:07,920
profile right you the two profiles that

331
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:09,990
we provided are sort of a amnesiac right

332
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,069
we said this is a mode you can operate

333
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,660
in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is another mode you can</font>

334
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,420
operate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and it doesn't include any</font>

335
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,860
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like shifting modes over time or</font>

336
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,410
anything like that if we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

337
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,800
define some kind of sensible policy for

338
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:24,089
how you could learn or latch or from one

339
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,170
to the other or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that I</font>

340
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,230
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a separate</font>

341
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:29,370
discussion so I'm fine with<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font>

342
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,680
opportunistic mode is opportunistic and

343
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:33,300
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> with what Paul said and then if we</font>

344
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,120
wanted to find something that like is a

345
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:39,209
cleverer more stateful way of being that

346
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:42,150
we could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as a separate draft I'm</font>

347
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:47,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">hearing that hot file is toast for this</font>

348
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:49,290
draft dan York I would just note that

349
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:53,069
you're actually right their debts for

350
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:56,990
the record<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's 7435 is the I'm really</font>

351
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,990

362
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">Stuart Cheshire thank you and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looks</font>

363
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">like an Andrew in the back ajs so a way</font>

364
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:42,810
to think about this is if you

365
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:45,450
participated in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 73 5445 discussion</font>

366
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:47,850
you know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to define</font>

367
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:50,100
opportunistic you absolutely should be

368
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:52,620
reviewing this document because if you

369
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,830
had an opinion then this is the best way

370
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,300
to know whether your opinion was valid

371
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:59,040
actually I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure your opinion was valid</font>

372
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:04,110
this is the best way to prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your</font>

373
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:05,790
opinion was valid um I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a pound</font>

374
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,409
set over there who hasn't offered to

375
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:10,570
review yet

376
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:12,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">just write them down okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we can</font>

381
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:25,350
opportunity to volunteer to review the

382
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:29,530
draft it's a nice draft oh yes

383
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:33,250
volunteering sorry are ya thank you sir

384
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:46,780
okay thank you and next<font color="#CCCCCC"> ed NSO padding</font>

385
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:52,390
profiles do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh click your</font>

386
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:54,460
scenes here thanks everyone um so this

387
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:56,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">is about the drafters sent in the</font>

388
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,809
individual submission draft me<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hope</font>

389
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,640
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> deprived betting profiles i sent it</font>

390
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:03,280
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before the deadline</font>

391
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,370
so understand if well not too many

392
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,120
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have read it so a short recap</font>

393
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:11,678
what seediness you're petting all about

394
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:15,669
even even recent cryptid<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns there's a</font>

395
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,990
there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> probability that you might</font>

396
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to gather some kind of</font>

397
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,800
information based on the size of the

398
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,110
encrypted packages so there's a size

399
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:28,300
based correlation<font color="#CCCCCC"> side-channel attack on</font>

400
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:31,928
on on encrypted units so the idea was

401
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:34,570
then to conceal the original message

402
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:37,170
size by reading it in some way<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

403
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:42,490
what we did we published RFC 7-830

404
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:47,530
inmate is here which arm has an IDI na<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0</font>

405
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:50,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">option that essentially has just certain</font>

406
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:54,100
lengths of croft headed to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> package</font>

407
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:56,440
preferable 0 bytes um in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that draft are</font>

408
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,419
in the Darcy however there's there was

409
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,480
deliberately no specification of the

410
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:03,040
bedding<font color="#E5E5E5"> lengths because we found that it</font>

411
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,190
would be easier to specify the option

412
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:08,290
right away and talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the actual</font>

413
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:13,120
application of that options the later

414
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:14,678
point in time um so actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font>

415
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,178
ongoing implementation work i have

416
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:17,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">listed a couple of the implementations</font>

417
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:20,559
on that page<font color="#E5E5E5"> i hope it's up to date if</font>

418
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:23,470
you don't find your implementation

419
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,908
on theirs and you should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an email so</font>

420
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,980
in multiple implement is actually

421
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:28,600
approached me and said so what's what's

422
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:32,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">the right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> padding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yanks do i use what</font>

423
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,969
what in what way to a pit so there was

424
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:37,689
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> text available regarding possible</font>

425
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:40,299
strategies arm and even further there is

426
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,980
no text available<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the quality of a</font>

427
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:44,559
certain strategy how do we actually

428
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:48,009
measure the quality of a certain

429
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,690
strategy in which we paid um even<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

430
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:52,779
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> interestingly is there a single</font>

431
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:56,559
best strategy is there the pony<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

432
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:59,139
all want and we believe that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

433
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,908
wrong spot for too much creativity so we

434
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:04,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that you can you can do a lot of</font>

435
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:07,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">things wrong and we need implement their</font>

436
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:09,549
guidance so I created the Strommen

437
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:12,700
proposal that's actually very short

438
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:14,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">craft it's the fully baked that contains</font>

439
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,019
a couple of options so the most obvious

440
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,669
option is you simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> do no padding which</font>

441
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:21,669
obviously doesn't improve the situation

442
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:23,799
at all you can do fixed length bedding

443
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:26,830
which obviously is easily discoverable

444
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:30,539
by a single packet so it doesn't improve

445
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:33,580
the situation as well um you can do

446
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:36,850
create the packet the message to certain

447
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:38,139
law flings you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose the witch</font>

448
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,509
which block lens you want to pay it

449
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:43,149
seems like most people either go for 64

450
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:46,809
or 128 bit by<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's at the current point</font>

451
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:49,059
in time you can of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah do random</font>

452
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:52,960
lengths back there petting so you use a

453
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:54,490
uniformly distributed size of pairings

454
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,549
that you spread out<font color="#E5E5E5"> across all your</font>

455
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:59,889
packets and you can also randomize the

456
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:01,539
block lengths you appeared there like it

457
00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:05,229
probably a couple of more strategies arm

458
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:07,149
and it sort of talks a little bit about

459
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:11,860
the pros and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cons for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each profile of</font>

460
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:14,559
strategy so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I received a couple of</font>

461
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:17,350
comments around good it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

462
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:20,080
great start<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm I did clarification of</font>

463
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,549
one strategy I received comments that

464
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,168
there might be more strategies for

465
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:25,690
example what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we call the full monty</font>

466
00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:28,269
strategy which is parish message to the

467
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:32,169
absolute limit of of the message size

468
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:33,519
and so I had the impression that it

469
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:34,240
would be interesting to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

470
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,080
group and moving

471
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,640
what would be a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so um the</font>

472
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,530
most exciting thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing this week we</font>

473
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,240
had a hallway discussion yesterday that

474
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:46,480
was really great it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like about an</font>

475
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,309
hour arm so and what what we find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

476
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,400
this there is actually ongoing research

477
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:53,260
by a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the quality</font>

478
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,720
estimation of that strategies so

479
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:58,840
danielle<font color="#E5E5E5"> has some data that he's going</font>

480
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at sarah said she probably would</font>

481
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:04,090
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get some research papers even</font>

482
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,590
in and we also found out<font color="#E5E5E5"> i need to</font>

483
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:09,669
change it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft that padding</font>

484
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:11,830
shouldn't consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> TM l.d.b.d</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the TCB</font>

485
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:13,059
message length to buy prefix we actually

486
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:16,120
didn't know what the correct description

487
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:17,980
of that was but UDP and<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP a message is</font>

488
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,239
differ by lengths of two and we

489
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,280
shouldn't consider that for petting

490
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:25,570
because there is a certain use case that

491
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,070
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it discoverable so and also</font>

492
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">we were concerned about client</font>

493
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:32,889
fingerprinting so if a client follows a

494
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:35,020
specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> reading strategy arm then it</font>

495
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:37,630
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to fingerprint a</font>

496
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,220
client based on its mating behavior so

497
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,140
that's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good thing and a single</font>

498
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:44,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">golden strategy that we can come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font>

499
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:46,270
with prevent this<font color="#CCCCCC"> um we also found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

500
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we might need to consider future</font>

501
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:52,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">Adina's options especially on the query</font>

502
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:55,690
side because this might change the query

503
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,120
size of of messages and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> media t</font>

504
00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:02,500
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> fruity proof on that and so</font>

505
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:04,290
regarding which strategy is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best we</font>

506
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,090
probably found a formula that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like</font>

507
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:08,920
its privacy game versus bandwidth and

508
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:13,629
processing costs so we need to look into

509
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:17,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so a question um what are the next</font>

510
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:18,670
steps so hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> more research is</font>

511
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,320
coming in soon so we gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at some</font>

512
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:23,770
data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we received from from</font>

513
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,928
recursive DNS operators like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

514
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:28,720
with my recursive DNS operators at a

515
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:30,640
local university as well um and more

516
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,350
like the questions that I'm sort of like

517
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,630
channeling you guys is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this a problem</font>

518
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:36,820
that the working group sings a exists

519
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:39,010
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pH should be addressed and yada yada</font>

520
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:42,639
the next logical step is this document

521
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:47,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually something that we can r adopt</font>

522
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,760
as a boilerplate without having a red

523
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,250
face

524
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,540
or it is for this working group so

525
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:57,330
that's it I had five minutes and

526
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:59,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">comments questions how many people</font>

527
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually read the draft or the</font>

528
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,510
discussion around it oh yeah we were

529
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:08,310
gonna ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool I get</font>

530
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:11,040
where you half dozen<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah Derek line I'm</font>

531
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:15,210
hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll permit me a very naive</font>

532
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:17,340
question where or which wich of the ones

533
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:19,200
described would you say or what are the

534
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:24,689
advantages or disadvantages specifically

535
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:27,960
of just padding to say MSS um well I

536
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:30,690
think it's a resource question if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

537
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a mobile client maybe and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your may</font>

538
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:35,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">be concerned about betting each energy</font>

539
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:36,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">every message to the full monty lengths</font>

540
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,010
of what we have but that's that's

541
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,350
something that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to research</font>

542
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:43,379
what's a real impact the ways that we

543
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:47,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">can we can probably pay it each query to</font>

544
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:49,590
256 bytes arm and no query is larger

545
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:51,810
than like 120 or something or or padding

546
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:55,050
to 1280 MTU kind of things you sort of

547
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:56,669
adding to a concise message as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

548
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:58,860
there are probably more strategies and

549
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:01,800
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to describe them arm the</font>

550
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,360
question is whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to like have</font>

551
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,620
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop the kombucha bigger bigger all</font>

552
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,959
the time with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the strategies and</font>

553
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:09,810
then finally like compact<font color="#E5E5E5"> it again to</font>

554
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,460
the one strategy we came up with it's

555
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,870
the good one so it's a question of what

556
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,370
such strategy for the threat I wasn't

557
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:17,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">offering it as yesterday I have no idea</font>

558
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:20,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">if it's a good idea or a bad idea has</font>

559
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:22,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">been just a padding to a fixed like um</font>

560
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,270
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're ready Kelly from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a princess</font>

561
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:26,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">room to you from a privacy perspective</font>

562
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:28,770
petting each and every message to the

563
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,120
absolute maximum after yeah I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> quick</font>

564
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,680
sort of does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> too i think at the</font>

565
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,449
moment right the initial quick exchanges

566
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,890
I think they Pat it out to Gibby<font color="#CCCCCC"> garant</font>

567
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:36,540
among other things to make sure that

568
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:39,690
there aren't any path MTU problems but

569
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:44,220
like you just had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP MSS or</font>

570
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:47,460
something right anyway thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you Paul</font>

571
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,920
Hoffman um I have I have concern not

572
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:52,950
like researched concern about some of

573
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:54,780
this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> two reasons one is I believe</font>

574
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the privacy are trying to get is</font>

575
00:26:54,780 --> 00:27:00,060
over the name itself the length of the

576
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:01,470
name<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blank name but it ignores the</font>

577
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:04,530
fact that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be other</font>

578
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:08,070
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero options possibly to it so if</font>

579
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:11,190
you say pad<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 100 bytes which seems</font>

580
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:14,668
like enough for most domain names is

581
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:16,679
that 100 bytes including the Eden s0

582
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:18,720
that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> already that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that the</font>

583
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:20,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">other eating of 0 options are not and if</font>

584
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,799
it is including the other eating at zero

585
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,409
options then that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one has to be</font>

586
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,150
added<font color="#E5E5E5"> last etc you now have have</font>

587
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:30,870
introduced a processing thing I think

588
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:33,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focused on just we're</font>

589
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:38,219
trying to add length privacy to the

590
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:40,830
domain name that in fact a number in you

591
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:43,980
know if we figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out normal domain name</font>

592
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:46,110
sizes and add some<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that light like we</font>

593
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at those sort of long tail knowing</font>

594
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to miss some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

595
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,299
and so we're gonna add zero padding or

596
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:54,510
you know obvious padding to some of them

597
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:55,770
but get<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety-five percent in I think</font>

598
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,600
that'll be ok and I don't think it's

599
00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:00,750
going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of characters I think</font>

600
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,299
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're really talking 50 or</font>

601
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:05,190
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so maximum i think</font>

602
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:11,400
is a really bad idea for many was damned

603
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:14,909
and your plugin oh it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that early</font>

604
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:17,970
in the morning um but um it you know so

605
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:20,580
if the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> statement is it's just</font>

606
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,740
the length of the name do a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:24,780
of research on<font color="#CCCCCC"> name links</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do</font>

608
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">ridiculous ones and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we'll be</font>

609
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,789
fine because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't be adding that</font>

610
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:33,590
much um yeah a couple of couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

611
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:36,210
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that so first what the I</font>

612
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:38,010
what's the current way<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current</font>

613
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:41,159
implementations work in a way that they

614
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:42,720
had betting as the last option after all

615
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:45,000
the other in ens your options have been

616
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,159
added<font color="#E5E5E5"> yep and all the implementations</font>

617
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm aware of to petting to a certain</font>

618
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:52,230
block lengths 64 also be atomic so and

619
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:54,150
regarding coming back to a question

620
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:56,120
about is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to conceal the name</font>

621
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:59,520
itself the queue name or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

622
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:01,229
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> understanding from from from the from</font>

623
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:06,418
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> academic working that the area is</font>

624
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:08,669
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the suspicion is that the whole</font>

625
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:10,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">length of the packet including the</font>

626
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:13,020
corresponding response is being used to

627
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:14,549
fingerprint the name so it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

628
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,299
help to conceal the length of the name

629
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:18,539
itself

630
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:21,119
it's the combination of the original

631
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:25,679
message links and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the response links so</font>

632
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:27,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay um so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

633
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,119
it's okay it gives you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like a</font>

634
00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:34,019
space of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a two-dimensional matrix</font>

635
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:36,330
of query lengths and response lengths

636
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:39,210
and once you got like only three packets

637
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:41,009
in that bin yeah and you see such a

638
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,899
combination coming in you can like guess

639
00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:45,149
between car games yeah it gets even

640
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:47,100
worse looking at a whole traffic of

641
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:50,248
require sure as they have like

642
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:53,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">Collateral dns queries like okay then</font>

643
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:55,950
then you should say if you're using this

644
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,799
you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> should do it last I think</font>

645
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:00,570
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 7 8 30 but I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look it</font>

646
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,158
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I think I don't remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it from</font>

647
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:08,539
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> ens you're petting must be the</font>

648
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:11,309
last option applies ok sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dickinson I</font>

649
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:14,700
just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> express support for this</font>

650
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:15,928
draft I've sat in for hackathons we're

651
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,759
different people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to implement</font>

652
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:19,889
this and every<font color="#CCCCCC"> single time they SAT</font>

653
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:22,799
there and said how am I supposed to do

654
00:30:19,889 --> 00:30:24,330
this um it's a real problem and I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

655
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,730
like to see it move forward quickly

656
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:28,259
because the sooner we have the same

657
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:30,450
mechanism across the implementations

658
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:32,669
more effective this<font color="#E5E5E5"> technique is going</font>

659
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:36,409
to be so I'm willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to review and</font>

660
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:40,619
commit texture<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool thanks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sarah thanks</font>

661
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:42,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">Allison Mencken um I also obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

662
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:44,759
much support the draft I am really<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad</font>

663
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,809
the question about the golden standard

664
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:51,779
surfaced because when you go to various

665
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:53,639
gatherings of privacy researchers it's

666
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:55,649
often<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case that everything you've</font>

667
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:59,428
done everything right and then a pattern

668
00:30:55,649 --> 00:31:01,738
from the DMS support gives you away it

669
00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:03,440
gives away what you are and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

670
00:31:01,739 --> 00:31:06,149
important to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be very</font>

671
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,940
indistinguishable in that front and also

672
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:11,639
remember that people may<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to use an</font>

673
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:14,460
agreed-upon port such that it's not

674
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:16,619
distinguishable this DNS so facilitating

675
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,080
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be a piece that isn't in the</font>

676
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:22,158
draft at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks for</font>

677
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming it's nice</font>

678
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:26,970
this is dkg as someone who's done

679
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,370
implementations of padding thank you

680
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:30,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much for advancing this I would be</font>

681
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:33,899
really happy if the working group would

682
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:39,810
consider this for adoption and I do also

683
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:41,340
offer to review<font color="#E5E5E5"> sale uh I I I want to</font>

684
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:43,139
see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> advance because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think if</font>

685
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,909
people can contribute as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> strap is</font>

686
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,440
under discussion if they have new

687
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:49,290
padding policy is like what came up

688
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,450
earlier about TCP MSS I would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

689
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:53,700
see those contributions happen on the

690
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:55,080
list I don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> specific preference</font>

691
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,730
because I don't have the data right now

692
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,960
but we're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on getting the data</font>

693
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:00,210
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully we can have something</font>

694
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,310
that's published that compares things so

695
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,450
if you have a proposal we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

696
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,950
framework to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to test that</font>

697
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,290
proposal but you got to let us<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

698
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,760
what the padding mechanism is so

699
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:10,440
gathering data and trying to do research

700
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:15,600
right now and I would love to have us

701
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:17,070
have a concrete recommendation John

702
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,699
Lavigne I'm sort of agreeing with Dan

703
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:23,580
here is I totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> endorsed the this</font>

704
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:26,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">drafted concept my concern about the</font>

705
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:28,350
about the details is that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

706
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:29,910
many options right now and I'm wondering

707
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:31,980
whether you know if people are really

708
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,570
doing vigorously doing research could be

709
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">Park it long enough to see if there's</font>

710
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:36,300
some of them would speak with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font>

711
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,860
the options we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw out throw out</font>

712
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:43,290
and give us ideally only one or two

713
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:47,030
options so go ahead so as a quick show

714
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:47,030
of hands who all has read this document

715
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:58,770
who all has read the document okay um

716
00:32:52,140 --> 00:33:01,230
let's try and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an idea on we'll do a</font>

717
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:04,020
quick hum on a call for adoption it

718
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:06,030
sounds as<font color="#E5E5E5"> though people who support it</font>

719
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,530
support it fairly strongly so we'll have

720
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:09,930
to do this on list as well but we'll try

721
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:11,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">and keep it really short and a reminder</font>

722
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:13,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to people to please comment on the list</font>

723
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:17,010
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do an on list call for adoption</font>

724
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:18,720
so we'll do a hum first for those who

725
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:20,820
think we should adopt this document and

726
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">then another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one for those who think we</font>

727
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:25,379
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> not adopt this document so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

728
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:32,280
who think we should adopt this document

729
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:34,410
please hum now and multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> homes in the</font>

730
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,879
chat room<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who think we</font>

731
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:42,150
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> not adopt this document please</font>

732
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:43,680
him now great for the minute taker there

733
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:47,400
was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of support for us adopting</font>

734
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,170
this we will do it on this but I'm

735
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">assuming this will be adopted so if</font>

736
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,770
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can also please stop providing</font>

737
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:56,490
feedback so you know it can be

738
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:58,410
incorporated as when etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be</font>

739
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:00,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">great yeah look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> call for</font>

740
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:03,240
adoption probably this afternoon has

741
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:06,240
that to get on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list we're not going</font>

742
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">to waste time yep and yep when the call</font>

743
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,418
for adoption happens please<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

744
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:11,610
review the document it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only six pages</font>

745
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:13,529
long and as you know the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

746
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:16,530
pages always boilerplate and you know

747
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:18,000
should must etc it's short I fear it's

748
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:20,399
going to crow<font color="#E5E5E5"> but as I said we can</font>

749
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,929
hopefully shrink it again like them to

750
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:25,469
you like you Rachel documents it's made

751
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:27,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">us thank you okay thanks so let me just</font>

752
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:29,668
double check that was all of the primary

753
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:31,850
set that was the primary sir okay so

754
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:35,580
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the primary set of things um</font>

755
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:37,860
the there's been sort of some push to it

756
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:40,110
have more of a sort of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> style</font>

757
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:42,330
of working group meetings so we're going

758
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:46,429
to experimenting with sort of a buff

759
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:49,590
style thing here on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phase to work</font>

760
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:51,000
our charter doesn't actually specify

761
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:53,460
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only work on the Phase one</font>

762
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,168
work but when we started discussing this

763
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,300
you know we'd always discuss their being

764
00:34:55,168 --> 00:34:59,609
phase one which is dubbed recursive and

765
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,830
then phase two which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a cursive to</font>

766
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:04,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">auth so we're gonna discuss the phase</font>

767
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:12,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">two stuff now I'm Stefan will be leading</font>

768
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:13,580
this yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess we'll start</font>

769
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,140
general chat it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be much less</font>

770
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:18,819
formal although this hasn't been a

771
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:21,620
particularly formal meeting so far so

772
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:24,980
picking<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a cartel I would also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest</font>

773
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:27,799
to review the milestones because now all

774
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:30,920
the milestones I've been done so we have

775
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do we are so unless we want</font>

776
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:38,780
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sleep we have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

777
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:40,850
some work so current state so I said the

778
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:43,160
cutter said that the primary focus is

779
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:48,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">the link between the stub resolver on</font>

780
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:52,700
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wizards 0 itself we have already ofc</font>

781
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:55,220
78 58 about step to resolve the

782
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:57,919
authentication and I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that profile</font>

783
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:00,439
document will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be published as well soon</font>

784
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:04,070
so basically this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> done great</font>

785
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:07,640
congratulations but door cutter also int

786
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:09,380
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can walk on the wizard virtual</font>

787
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,180
so additive link on any way we can

788
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:16,550
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> reach out if we think it's</font>

789
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:19,520
important my proposal is to reuse what

790
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:21,740
we have done with DNS over TLS I I don't

791
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,750
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the point of inventing a new</font>

792
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:26,569
protocol for the resolver to

793
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:30,500
authoritative link we already<font color="#CCCCCC"> have FFC</font>

794
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:33,920
78 58 we should we use it or the future

795
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:35,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the dtls as well but this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leaves</font>

796
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,640
the big issue which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a one of</font>

797
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:39,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication if you don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Datuk</font>

798
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,810
authenticate if you are completely

799
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:45,800
opportunistic it's okay we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

800
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:49,690
doing with over to<font color="#E5E5E5"> author a tat if TLS</font>

801
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:52,000
tomorrow no today even today but

802
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:54,710
authentication is of course a big deal

803
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,410
it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is quite different from</font>

804
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:59,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the stub to resolve a problem because in</font>

805
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:01,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">the step to resolve well you are very</font>

806
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:04,910
few service typically you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a static</font>

807
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:07,400
configuration for a few resolvers that

808
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:10,720
you trust and you have a TLS link with

809
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:14,270
them you you can even have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a static key</font>

810
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:17,240
so which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok I mean the static keep</font>

811
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:19,850
pinging is ok for this link but in the

812
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:23,660
resolver to authoritative the wizard

813
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:25,790
world do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not talk to a few machines that</font>

814
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:29,210
it knows about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it talks to</font>

815
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:32,150
hundred thousand dozens of thousands of

816
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:35,110
authoritative servers and most case it

817
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:38,540
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have a pre-existing</font>

818
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:41,180
relationship with them so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance a</font>

819
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:42,650
static key in the case of wizard were

820
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:45,020
too<font color="#E5E5E5"> authoritative is simply out of</font>

821
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:48,140
question so we need something<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

822
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:50,840
dynamic so there are many possible

823
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:53,600
techniques in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this draft</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried to make</font>

824
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:56,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">a complete</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list the goal of the draft is</font>

825
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:59,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">that to suggest one possible solution is</font>

826
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:02,180
at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage just to list all the</font>

827
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:04,400
possible tactics a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them for</font>

828
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:06,529
instance could be simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> anchored the</font>

829
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,520
public key of the authoritative server

830
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:13,790
in its name then we using delegation as

831
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:16,160
a way to convey authentication

832
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:18,050
information public information which why

833
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,690
it's already done in the script it's one

834
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:22,820
possible solution my goal here is that

835
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:24,740
to say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is a wide solution but</font>

836
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:27,950
just to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the problem is</font>

837
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:30,350
perfectly tractable and other

838
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:33,439
possibilities to use ordinary pickax

839
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:35,299
validation I mean in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TLS answer from</font>

840
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,390
the authoritative server you have a

841
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:41,260
certificate we can validate it the sort

842
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:44,060
of thing you can also put the

843
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:47,480
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the certificate in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

844
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:49,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS itself is then it's a bit tricky</font>

845
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,910
because then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chicken-and-egg</font>

846
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:55,339
problem but it can be solved under thou

847
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:57,080
also support solutions are we fell to

848
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:00,380
the draft if you want to have the listen

849
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:04,130
please if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forgot one possible solution</font>

850
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:08,840
in the draft send email<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the list pull</font>

851
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:11,690
request anything so one of the difficult

852
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:14,540
thing is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to find out how many</font>

853
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:16,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">solution that we use I mean we may</font>

854
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:19,310
decide that we have only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one way to</font>

855
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,129
authenticate the white one we may decide

856
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:23,600
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two and three but not of course</font>

857
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:25,730
I think in the draft there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are six</font>

858
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,830
possible solutions it's not realistic to

859
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:30,020
try all of them and there is a problem

860
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:33,080
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course if they give different</font>

861
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:35,990
results you have to choose which one was

862
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:38,900
white so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we decide to have two or</font>

863
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:41,919
three solutions we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> design of the</font>

respective pie

865
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:50,020
so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> concrete things to do in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

866
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:54,100
opinion we should try to decide not not

867
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:56,550
today but were<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the mailing list among</font>

868
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:59,770
the solutions in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft which one are</font>

869
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:02,230
interesting realistic then of course

870
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:06,130
white an<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet draft with it I</font>

00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:08,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't here for that by the way if so</font>

872
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:11,200
enough people volunteer to be a

00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:14,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">participants reviewers etc that one of</font>

874
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:17,230
the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would like to assess is if</font>

875
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:20,500
there is enough steam in the group to

876
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:22,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on this maybe we need to update the</font>

877
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,670
chart out while<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not really</font>

878
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:27,130
interested in the bureaucratic stuff

879
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:32,320
like that but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's necessary why</font>

880
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:41,560
not and then it's done so open to

881
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:42,490
discussion now and just affect<font color="#E5E5E5"> no you</font>

882
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,560
know we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have this discussion</font>

883
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:46,509
we also need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to negotiate with our ad</font>

884
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,180
and what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be doing after</font>

885
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:53,080
this potentially getting more deployment

886
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:56,470
experience etc is needed first but this

887
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:59,350
is dkg<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely think we should push</font>

888
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:01,720
for this I worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the question</font>

889
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:03,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">is how much team do we have and we judge</font>

890
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,319
it on the fact that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the last</font>

891
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,900
session on friday at the ITF i hope that

892
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:12,960
i hope we you know adjust for that

893
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:15,490
variable it would be a real shame to

894
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,360
wrap up deprived without trying to

895
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:21,160
address this this leg<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

896
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:24,060
get into which of the different

897
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:26,859
solutions i think is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right one here</font>

898
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:29,110
except<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that in addition to i</font>

899
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:30,850
think picking a very small number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

900
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:32,680
possible authentication mechanisms<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

901
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:34,299
think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should make sure that we also</font>

902
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,370
think concretely about deployment

903
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:38,350
strategy because we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

904
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:42,250
mixed network for a long time possibly

00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:44,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">forever because at the ITF we go with</font>

00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:47,610
the curse of the deployed base but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

907
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:50,560
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that we think about</font>

908
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:53,680
proposing concrete strategies for

909
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:58,630
recursive resolvers who don't know where

910
00:41:53,680 --> 00:42:01,029
they're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to appear that that can</font>

911
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,170
do this and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the case you know</font>

912
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,760
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we that we</font>

913
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:06,040
have a strategy for how to get how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

914
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,450
get there so yes I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should do</font>

915
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,890
the stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to make sure that</font>

916
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:11,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">it also includes implementation guidance</font>

917
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:13,808
that's practical and deployable in a

918
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:15,759
mixed network a related<font color="#E5E5E5"> implementation</font>

919
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:18,130
problem is that in the future if this

920
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,260
works resolve were talking to a new

921
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:23,829
authoritative it doesn't know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

922
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:27,010
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to choose between UDP TCP TLS on</font>

923
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:32,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">DTLS so certainly it requires some</font>

924
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:35,410
smartness<font color="#CCCCCC"> dan yerka coming in is Jabbar</font>

925
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,910
scribe relaying from<font color="#CCCCCC"> shanker he says I</font>

926
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:39,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is important work and</font>

927
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:41,140
supports adoption I think the scaling

928
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,900
properties of resolver to authoritative

929
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:46,270
may mean that DNS over TLS is non

930
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,619
optimal I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> this but it seems</font>

931
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:50,640
possible independent of the

932
00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:50,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication problem</font>

933
00:42:54,910 --> 00:43:00,160
and so I've talked to some people about

934
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:01,930
this before earlier than<font color="#E5E5E5"> this week and I</font>

935
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,618
said I was sort of negative on it

936
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:06,819
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a big concern about</font>

937
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:09,930
authoritative servers being open to

938
00:43:06,819 --> 00:43:12,690
attack on their CPU and memory on

939
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:15,250
opening up too many TLS connections in

940
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:16,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">the normal response as well Google does</font>

941
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:19,210
it and Facebook does it therefore

942
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:21,399
everyone can do it and my response has

943
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:23,289
been well they get paid to do that

944
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">whereas a lot of authoritative servers</font>

945
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:27,609
don't really get paid that much to do

946
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:30,010
things in this week though<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked with</font>

947
00:43:27,609 --> 00:43:32,259
dkg and I actually am now much more

948
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:34,329
sanguine about doing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

949
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:38,020
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are ways by pickings that frozen</font>

950
00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:39,490
since maybe TLS 1.3 only suggesting

951
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:42,190
using lipped occurs and such like that

952
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:45,250
so I am I am much much more positive

953
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:47,650
that we can probably deployed<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

954
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:51,280
without opening authoritative servers

955
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:54,549
who want to do it too easy cpu and

956
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,650
memory denial service attacks having

957
00:43:54,549 --> 00:44:00,309
said that one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't really see</font>

958
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:02,470
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your draft much is what we've just</font>

959
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:06,819
been spending time on which is profiles

960
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:09,308
for strict<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus opportunistic and I</font>

961
00:44:06,819 --> 00:44:11,470
would suspect that in the early days and

962
00:44:09,309 --> 00:44:13,660
maybe even later opportunistic will be

963
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:16,589
just fine for a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people and</font>

964
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:19,930
therefore I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with what Dan said</font>

965
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:22,319
that what we should do in whatever

966
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:24,700
document we do is we also specify

967
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:27,910
deployment strategies and it's perfectly

968
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:29,500
fine I think for a recursive operator to

969
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:31,149
be doing this opportunistically

970
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,950
particularly if they're a validating

971
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:34,960
recursive resolver if all they're doing

972
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:37,149
this for is to get encryption and they

973
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,890
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about who I'm talking</font>

974
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:41,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">to because they're going to do DNS SEC</font>

975
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:43,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">validation that might be sufficient for</font>

976
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:46,059
them I don't know I would I haven't

977
00:44:43,779 --> 00:44:47,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">written down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the chart of with the lines</font>

978
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:49,960
and such like that but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would suspect</font>

979
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:53,079
opportunistic would actually be just

980
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:54,730
fine as well so I very much support

981
00:44:53,079 --> 00:45:00,400
doing this work I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that this is a</font>

982
00:44:54,730 --> 00:45:04,000
very logical next step and I agree with

983
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">you that for doing authentication we</font>

984
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,260
should have a limited number<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

985
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:08,680
think it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just one we should</font>

986
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,670
have limit

987
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,799
number some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ones that you've</font>

988
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:14,950
proposed in fact work together well so

989
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:17,470
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do a DNS curve type naming</font>

990
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:20,200
scheme and<font color="#E5E5E5"> P kicks there's no reason not</font>

991
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:24,819
to and now that we're in a world where

992
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:26,230
it's fairly easy to get TLS certs it may

993
00:45:24,819 --> 00:45:28,660
be that one or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other would be just</font>

994
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:30,040
fine you know so that is we can have

995
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:33,940
both of those and someone might combine

996
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:35,800
them it's true that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> profile</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are not</font>

997
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:38,079
in the current draft because there is

998
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,609
one more difference between a stub to

999
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,890
visit van with other two authoritative

1000
00:45:39,609 --> 00:45:44,410
it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second case it's much more</font>

1001
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:46,540
difficult to report problem

1002
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:48,879
authentication programs to the users in

1003
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:51,670
the first case you can imagine to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1004
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,770
post popping up a message<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying there</font>

1005
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:55,540
was not possible to interrogation also

1006
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:57,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">deviations felt something like that in</font>

1007
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:59,680
though is<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to authoritative it's no</font>

1008
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:02,800
longer possible so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance a strict</font>

1009
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,720
is much more<font color="#CCCCCC"> dangerous yes I agree the</font>

1010
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:08,140
strict is more dangerous and therefore I

1011
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:10,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want us to insist on certain kind</font>

1012
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:12,339
insist on authentication although I

1013
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,859
certainly want us to allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because I</font>

1014
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:18,460
can imagine a world where a recursive

1015
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:21,759
operator would say I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to require</font>

1016
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:29,650
TLS authentication if the answers are

1017
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:31,900
not DNS SEC signed in principle I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1018
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:34,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">molar gumus on from cloudflare in</font>

1019
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:36,520
principle I support a work like this but

1020
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:40,299
there are certain serious scaling issues

1021
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:42,160
that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about when you</font>

1022
00:46:40,299 --> 00:46:46,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">sent a question to an authoritative</font>

1023
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:48,098
server it may be serving up hundreds of

1024
00:46:46,089 --> 00:46:50,828
use or you may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your network</font>

1025
00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:53,559
hundreds of a name author of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the servers</font>

1026
00:46:50,829 --> 00:46:56,500
and we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily want every</font>

1027
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:58,240
recursive farm to have a TLS connection

1028
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:01,240
to every combination of IP addresses

1029
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,368
between the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them so any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol</font>

1030
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:05,140
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to scale in this</font>

1031
00:47:03,369 --> 00:47:08,440
world is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of a</font>

1032
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:11,319
tunneling mechanism in my opinion so we

1033
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:13,720
can tell them somehow over the protocol

1034
00:47:11,319 --> 00:47:15,520
any questions for these address ranges

1035
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:20,200
just send them to me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll figure out</font>

1036
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:22,400
how to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to you almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I envision</font>

1037
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:25,250
this some kind of a proxy service

1038
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,619
not as<font color="#E5E5E5"> ins necessary connection directly</font>

1039
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:36,349
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nameserver just a trusted entity</font>

1040
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:41,059
on my network I think andrew is next and

1041
00:47:36,349 --> 00:47:44,059
then Allison I'm Andrew Sullivan um so I

1042
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:46,549
I guess I agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font>

1043
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:48,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">that people have said um i under i</font>

1044
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:50,930
looked at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that but</font>

1045
00:47:48,529 --> 00:47:52,339
I didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> very carefully and on it</font>

1046
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:54,049
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there there's an</font>

1047
00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:56,869
enormous number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of subtleties in there</font>

1048
00:47:54,049 --> 00:47:59,059
that I think the draft actually mentions

1049
00:47:56,869 --> 00:48:00,619
but that are maybe not entirely clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1050
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:04,430
people who have not operated this

1051
00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:06,680
infrastructure at large scale so I I

1052
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:08,538
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if this working group is</font>

1053
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:10,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to tackle this actually it really</font>

1054
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:13,039
does need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change its charter um</font>

1055
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,680
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the rest of the</font>

1056
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:17,450
IETF might be interested in this in a

1057
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:22,578
way that they were not interested in the

1058
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:23,779
stub to resolver case uh and and and

1059
00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:25,940
while<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

1060
00:48:23,779 --> 00:48:28,309
for somebody to object to that change of

1061
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,839
charter by getting up in public and

1062
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:31,819
saying no no privacy is a bad thing

1063
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:36,069
because they would be called down um you

1064
00:48:31,819 --> 00:48:38,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">know um frogs and so on upon them on the</font>

1065
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:40,130
the possibility of course is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if we</font>

1066
00:48:38,779 --> 00:48:41,599
don't do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the Charter</font>

1067
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:43,279
somebody will come along later if

1068
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,869
they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got an agenda about this and</font>

1069
00:48:43,279 --> 00:48:46,579
they'll complain that they weren't

1070
00:48:44,869 --> 00:48:48,529
warned<font color="#E5E5E5"> and though all the work will go</font>

1071
00:48:46,579 --> 00:48:50,599
for nothing so I would encourage us to

1072
00:48:48,529 --> 00:48:53,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">work out precisely what we were going to</font>

1073
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:56,210
do and then work out the range of things

1074
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:57,828
that are in this draft and some of the

1075
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:59,779
things that people just mentioned about

1076
00:48:57,829 --> 00:49:01,940
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope of the problems that are</font>

1077
00:48:59,779 --> 00:49:03,559
facing us because it's it's a it's a

1078
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:05,270
bigger piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work then I think it</font>

1079
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:06,859
initially<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks looks like just because</font>

1080
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:08,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've already got the model of the stub</font>

1081
00:49:06,859 --> 00:49:10,848
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> resolver while we all used to</font>

1082
00:49:08,869 --> 00:49:12,170
thinking of DNS is just sort of messages

1083
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:13,700
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are passed around but the</font>

1084
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:16,369
operational realities are very different

1085
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:22,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">thanks oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and thanks for the draft it's</font>

1086
00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:24,619
pretty good um so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1087
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:27,200
give more comments an email on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft</font>

1088
00:49:24,619 --> 00:49:29,329
but but I do also appreciate it<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1089
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:33,788
much I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to mention there's a</font>

1090
00:49:29,329 --> 00:49:36,260
there's a case where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might offer</font>

1091
00:49:33,789 --> 00:49:38,740
encrypted service to certain Authority

1092
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:42,290
natives because they have sensitivities

1093
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:44,450
and have people aware of or be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1094
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:48,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">be signaled that they can reach those</font>

1095
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:50,210
authoritative over TLS and it's a kind

1096
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:52,760
of a controlled case it's not the entire

1097
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:55,250
global infrastructure but for example

1098
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,760
authoritative that serve you know

1099
00:49:55,250 --> 00:50:00,530
controversial or dissident they

1100
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,570
information zones or things like that

1101
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:05,240
and I even<font color="#E5E5E5"> chatted a little bit with</font>

1102
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:07,370
Shane about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea that you could have</font>

1103
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:09,529
you like some instances of<font color="#CCCCCC"> root which</font>

1104
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:11,420
provide this and you just choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

1105
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:14,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to those if you think you need to lash</font>

1106
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:16,490
up a safer more private path all the way

1107
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:18,649
that's not quite the same as addressing

1108
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:21,129
making it bulletproof and making it

1109
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:24,020
available for the entire global<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

1110
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:26,300
so I don't know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can whether</font>

1111
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,680
that's a separate little draft to say we

1112
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:30,080
can use this in certain circumstances

1113
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,180
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have it now that could come</font>

1114
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:36,259
ahead of solving the problem in the more

1115
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:40,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">general case one of the consequences of</font>

1116
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:44,390
the first method the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS curve</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> adian</font>

1117
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:46,220
script didn't escape actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I there is</font>

1118
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:48,290
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mistake in the slide it's actually DNS</font>

1119
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:51,049
curve one of the consequences is that it

1120
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:53,500
can be used<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a form of signaling you</font>

1121
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:55,430
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that they can expect</font>

1122
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,410
cryptography and privacy from this

1123
00:50:55,430 --> 00:51:01,190
server something which you cannot done

1124
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:03,529
with cannot do with our FC 78 58 alone

1125
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:06,080
so maybe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should add something more</font>

1126
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:08,120
right have a way to offer that for as a

1127
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,130
service for certain servers that want to

1128
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,529
try it out yeah I think that's an

1129
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:15,680
interesting idea then is also another

1130
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:20,390
way to signal that y'all ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do TLS</font>

1131
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:22,810
and privacy you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess Mike and</font>

1132
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:27,520
and then John I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to respond</font>

1133
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:31,880
that's right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um its power angle</font>

1134
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:34,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">also mentioned the root servers and if</font>

1135
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,480
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you name is minimization there</font>

1136
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:39,880
may be an argument say you don't really

1137
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,880
need privacy at the root

1138
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:51,100
Oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> bubs Piniella good question a gun</font>

1139
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:52,839
hello this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is smokin from I see so stop</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the resolve the communications have</font>

1141
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:59,860
settled on TLS over<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP and this seems</font>

1142
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:03,100
fairly good for stop those other

1143
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:05,740
communications I am worried and I wonder

1144
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:07,720
if TLS over TCP is the right approach

1145
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:12,819
for resolver to a parrot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> civil</font>

1146
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:14,950
communications arm<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are several</font>

1147
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:19,900
round trips in establishing such a such

1148
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:21,520
a session<font color="#CCCCCC"> arm and when it is also</font>

1149
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:23,920
operates basically there are more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

1150
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,530
one look up usually when you're trying

1151
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look up some domain dns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s is the head</font>

1152
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:30,820
of everything so this adds<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1153
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:33,130
turnaround time for example if you're

1154
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:35,440
establishing a https session to a web

1155
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:37,690
server you first do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns lookup and</font>

1156
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">only then you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can start a connection as</font>

1157
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:43,090
you become<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp connection and then</font>

1158
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:46,420
idealist session<font color="#CCCCCC"> over that for HTTP but</font>

1159
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:48,250
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to have your domain</font>

1160
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:51,850
looked up your your address hooked up

1161
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:53,230
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that web</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server and if the if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1162
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:57,069
is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a lot of time then that</font>

1163
00:52:53,230 --> 00:53:01,890
adds<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the turn around time of of the</font>

1164
00:52:57,070 --> 00:53:05,230
entire basically HTTP connection now

1165
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:06,910
where I am in the world for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a typical</font>

1166
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:12,430
name server I get about 300 milliseconds

1167
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:14,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">or RTT so with a UDP lookup or plain</font>

1168
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:17,020
plain you repeat look up over DNS so

1169
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:20,259
that takes tended milliseconds if i add

1170
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:21,580
tcp with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 2-way 3-way handshake with</font>

1171
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:23,770
a three-way handshake let's not consider

1172
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:28,600
fast stupid right now we are still in

1173
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:30,310
olden times<font color="#E5E5E5"> um we uh you have at least</font>

1174
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,779
two round trips for that and then you

1175
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:34,690
establish<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell a session over that</font>

1176
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:37,840
that takes even more time even more

1177
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:39,940
round trips that is for one fetch from a

1178
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,980
recursive resolver to an authority of

1179
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:43,900
server you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have multiple fetches to</font>

1180
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:45,640
deal with so each fetch may take more

1181
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,710
than one second and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

1182
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:50,440
looking up for several seconds even

1183
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:51,550
before you actually do even before the

1184
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,710
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> is able to connect to</font>

1185
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:55,240
whatever address<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's trying to connect</font>

1186
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:58,540
to so I

1187
00:53:55,240 --> 00:54:02,310
and there are other methods um my

1188
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:06,730
colleague<font color="#CCCCCC"> we told presented one a couple</font>

1189
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:09,549
of ATF's ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yokohama and this is</font>

1190
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:12,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">based similar to the DJ</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> B method tienes</font>

1191
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:15,810
curve so which basically lets you use

1192
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:19,330
one round trip and UDP to get a

1193
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:20,529
encrypted connection to to an

1194
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:24,340
authoritative server from our recursive

1195
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:26,650
resolver so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we should we should</font>

1196
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:28,840
evaluate other approaches empirically

1197
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:30,520
and especially pls itself we should

1198
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,869
evaluate it empirically to see how well

1199
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:34,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">it will work before we settle owner</font>

1200
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:36,880
thank you and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be care this</font>

1201
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:40,029
discussion is mainly the you know do we

1202
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:42,670
want to move on to the phase to work not

1203
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:44,860
specifically you know Stefan's document

1204
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:48,190
or any<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular one of the specific</font>

1205
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:49,780
solutions the reason that we split up

1206
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:51,340
into phase 1 and phase 2 is because we

1207
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:53,380
realized phase two was a lot harder

1208
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:56,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are cursive tour you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know has a</font>

1209
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:59,020
lot more scaling issues a lot more

1210
00:54:56,190 --> 00:55:01,810
connections so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> lo you need to</font>

1211
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:04,210
make sure the latency is low etc yeah

1212
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:07,710
but I'm sorry I I just looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1213
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:11,830
graph which basically starts with key

1214
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:13,840
establishment for TLS over<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP a</font>

1215
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:16,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">dealer's over TLS that's what the draft</font>

1216
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:18,850
says and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why yeah but</font>

1217
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,220
certainly I agree well win but certainly

1218
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:22,720
it's important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1219
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:24,730
amount of folks that we have to do on

1220
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,529
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> coach we have to make on this one is</font>

1221
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:29,230
extremely important because I took for

1222
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:32,500
granted that we really we use DNS over

1223
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:34,359
TLS it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> up views apparently not</font>

1224
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:38,500
everyone agrees so this is certainly a

1225
00:55:34,359 --> 00:55:40,210
very important discussion on decision GM

1226
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:43,240
and then gentleman in the back and then

1227
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:45,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">dkg yeah generally speaking this for</font>

1228
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:47,200
myself self and I think the just very

1229
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:48,940
good idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of giving us all food for</font>

1230
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought and while I do think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1231
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:53,080
something that the group should be what

1232
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:54,340
kiala take things forward one thing I

1233
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">would see those we've got also think</font>

1234
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:59,830
that it very carefully we take this

1235
00:55:55,690 --> 00:56:01,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing on about the deployment plans dkg</font>

1236
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:03,609
was mentioning before and I'm particular

1237
00:56:01,869 --> 00:56:05,920
concern the boats if we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

1238
00:56:03,609 --> 00:56:06,759
some self secured mechanism for securing

1239
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,250
the path between us

1240
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:11,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">dub and resolving server and then doing</font>

1241
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:12,670
another one to secure the path from the

1242
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:14,230
resolving several to the thought the

1243
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:16,540
servers I think that's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get very</font>

1244
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:18,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">ugly if after separate mechanisms</font>

1245
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">beneath there was one overarching one</font>

1246
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:21,459
they could apply in both circumstances

1247
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,410
appreciate that's very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

1248
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:25,270
was also elastic horrible sorts of

1249
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:27,129
scaling issues in there it probably even

1250
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:28,540
can't be done but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

1251
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:29,770
this well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'd be useful to try</font>

1252
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:32,350
to think of it do<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are we we should</font>

1253
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:34,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">be clean and as simple as possible we've</font>

1254
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:35,770
got far too many potential paths here

1255
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,750
for doing the security for securing

1256
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:39,550
these communication paths already I

1257
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:41,650
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be adopted without</font>

1258

1260
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:49,930
simple hi my name is Tim<font color="#CCCCCC"> shepparton</font>

1261
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:51,820
actually first I'd like to thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1262
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:54,339
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful tutorial on Sunday</font>

1263
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:56,050
afternoon that was amazing I had paid no

1264
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:59,560
attention to this working group before

1265
00:56:56,050 --> 00:57:02,290
Sunday afternoon and I was that was a

1266
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:05,890
very well done tutorial and that's why I

1267
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:09,520
got interested to come this afternoon um

1268
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:12,549
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> well encryption encrypting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee</font>

1269
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:16,630
query in the reply from the stub to the

1270
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:19,450
resolver seems to solve the problem of

1271
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:22,420
providing privacy I think there's a

1272
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:24,910
deeper problem that the query from the

1273
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:27,130
resolver to the authoritative<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

1274
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:29,080
encrypt the query app that comes after

1275
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:32,620
the IP header and whatever other header

1276
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:34,810
but the IP header has in it the IP

1277
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:37,540
address of the authoritative server that

1278
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:40,990
it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and oh boy it seems to me</font>

1279
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:44,620
that that reveals a lot about what name

1280
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:47,649
you might be looking up and but perhaps

1281
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:49,810
from depending on what resolver you're

1282
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:51,760
using maybe it maybe it doesn't identify

1283
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:53,710
what user looked it up or something but

1284
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,650
there's something complicated and subtle

1285
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:58,980
about what problem are you trying to

1286
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:58,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">solve</font>

1287
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:05,450
to provide privacy in the traffic that

1288
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:09,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">flows between the the resolver and the</font>

1289
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:11,870
authoritative I mean there aren't there

1290
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:15,650
are a lot of authoritative servers in

1291
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:18,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">the world that serve up maybe only one</font>

1292
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:20,960
zone and well<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously they were trying</font>

1293
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:26,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look up a name in that zone and then</font>

1294
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:28,520
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the route I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um what is</font>

1295
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:32,149
the authority that<font color="#E5E5E5"> creates new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TLDs like</font>

00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:34,160

1297
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:35,800
canna but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how the process</font>

1298
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:38,240
works but they're creating lots of new

1299
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:41,150
top-level domains there's going to be an

1300
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:43,370
awful lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff in the route and I</font>

1301
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:46,010
guess maybe if you're looking up one of

1302
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:48,170
those then encrypting your communication

1303
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:50,690
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root does in fact provide some</font>

1304
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:52,640
privacy but anyway bye I just thought

1305
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:54,110
I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I actually before you figure</font>

1306
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">out how to encrypt and worrying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1307
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:58,550
scale I think you actually have to stop

1308
00:58:55,910 --> 00:59:02,450
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a moment step back and think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1309
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:05,150
what what problems are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

1310
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:08,029
solve and maybe which problems that you

1311
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:09,980
might like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve or insoluble etc and</font>

1312
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:11,690
think carefully about that that's just a

1313
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:13,520
thought so we are we excuse me but

1314
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:15,140
regarding the risk of communication

1315
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:19,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">between the wizard on the authoritative</font>

1316
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:22,250
i believe it is well covered in RFC 7626

1317
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:23,780
which is not limited to just stop to

1318
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:26,090
resolve<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh and there is a lot of</font>

1319
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:28,970
discussion about this exactly who you

1320
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:32,000
are talking about is the fact that you

1321
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:34,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to this authoritative server enough</font>

on to Daisy answer is no because

1324
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:40,640
unfortunately there is a big

1325
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:43,820
concentration of DNS authoritative

1326
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,740

someone talking with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dinah for instance</font>

1328
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:50,390
it gives me very little information

1329
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:53,689
because they asked what<font color="#CCCCCC"> 200,000 amends</font>

1331
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:58,430
it's not really a problem now I would

01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:39,740
special case because most of the time it

1348
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:43,480
doesn't really matter but all the other

1349

we address the other channels Alison's

1371
01:01:32,089 --> 01:01:36,980
point about saying that well maybe you

1372
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:39,348
could have some authoritative that you

1373
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:40,579
know you will always do strong crypto

1374
01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:43,099
because that's where you look up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1375
01:01:40,579 --> 01:01:44,900
dangerous stuff that worries me a lot

1376
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:47,000
that's an easy target for censorship

1377
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:48,349
will just block the sketchy

1378
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,119
authoritative and the no one will be

1379
01:01:48,349 --> 01:01:51,619
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the dangerous stuff so</font>

1380
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:53,540
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the outcome</font>

1381
01:01:51,619 --> 01:01:54,530
that we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be aiming for and if we</font>

1382
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:57,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">find ourselves heading in that direction</font>

1383
01:01:54,530 --> 01:02:00,380
I'd like to to step back and I thirdly

1384
01:01:57,770 --> 01:02:02,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">and this is my last point here I wanted</font>

1385
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:05,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">to call out something that Paul said</font>

1386
01:02:02,299 --> 01:02:06,950
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is worth noting he sort of</font>

1387
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:09,529
mentioned in passing that we could

1388
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:13,009
profile the authoritative the recursive

1389
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:16,670
to authoritative link it is TLS profiles

1390
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:20,780
so the the performance concerns are very

1391
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:23,119
real I thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> raising them but</font>

1392
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:25,670
with TLS by the time we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> around to</font>

1393
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:27,420
getting the specified fingers crossed

01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:32,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">here don't make me don't make me</font>

1395
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:35,579
liar but TLS 1.3 will exist sorry TLS

1396
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:40,530
1.3 combined with TLS with<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP fast open</font>

1397
01:02:35,579 --> 01:02:42,540
gives you actually a one-round like the

1398
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:44,190
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you get data in the</font>

1399
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:44,970
first packet it's not forward secure

1400
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:47,190
there's a bunch of weird other

1401
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:48,839
properties that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get from it but it</font>

1402
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:51,270
actually starts to look much more

1403
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:53,700
similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> in performance characteristics</font>

1404
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:55,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">to a UDP query at the very least if</font>

1405
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,730
you've made one additional<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe the</font>

1406
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:58,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">first time you ever talk to that server</font>

1407
01:02:56,730 --> 01:03:01,740
you have to cash a little bit of data as

1408
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:04,049
a client but once you do you can then do

1409
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:07,140
basically like one shot request get it

1410
01:03:04,049 --> 01:03:10,380
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> one shot answer back so so I'm not</font>

1411
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:12,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can profile the TLS bits</font>

1412
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:14,579
by the time this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is released</font>

1413
01:03:12,809 --> 01:03:15,869
we can say if you're going to deploy

1414
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:18,480
this stuff you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to pull it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1415
01:03:15,869 --> 01:03:19,650

01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make you to take</font>

1418
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:25,650
performance tuning characteristics that

1419
01:03:23,339 --> 01:03:29,880
we've got right now looks like that does

1420
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:32,220
note there's no cable on that mic I know

1421
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:35,579
it smoking again the first time is also

1422
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:37,169
important in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases you know</font>

1423
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:39,510
resolvers are moving closer and closer

<font color="#E5E5E5">to actual hosts that used them for</font>

1425
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:44,760
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tease getting a resolver</font>

1426

may be funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> but system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> T is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gay it has</font>

1427
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:50,369
a resolver resolver is a is a stub

1428
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:52,500
though it talks it's only a forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1429
01:03:50,369 --> 01:03:54,000
in any case you want to be as close as

1430
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible to your validating resolver</font>

1431
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,780
because most applications from validate

1432
01:03:55,619 --> 01:04:00,780
although DNS SEC allows into

1433
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:02,309
invalidation most applications basically

1434
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:04,799
trust whatever the resolver gives them

1435
01:04:02,309 --> 01:04:06,510
so you want you well you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1436
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,980

1440
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:16,170
and less and getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> resolves closer and</font>

closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to their hosts whatever using</font>

1443
01:04:19,349 --> 01:04:24,569
resolvers that are that don't have an

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and sorry I'm about to sit down</font>

1458
01:04:55,229 --> 01:04:59,249
I just want to point out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we may</font>

1459
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:01,288
need as a community to clarify the

1460
01:04:59,249 --> 01:05:04,019
distinction between having a local

1461
01:05:01,289 --> 01:05:06,479
validating resolver that just does the

1462
01:05:04,019 --> 01:05:09,569
validation and does forwarding to a

1463
01:05:06,479 --> 01:05:10,379
gathering resolver right so that's

1464
01:05:09,569 --> 01:05:12,630
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> system the</font>

1465
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:13,769
implementation is doing and I totally

1466
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:15,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">agree with you that you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1467
01:05:13,769 --> 01:05:16,799
validating resolver as close to you as

1468
01:05:15,299 --> 01:05:18,960
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you want it inside your</font>

1469
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:21,239
trust boundary but that may not be the

1470
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that does the recursive work right</font>

1471
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:25,019
you have your validating resolver that

1472
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:27,509
talks as a forwarder to a gathering

1473
01:05:25,019 --> 01:05:28,828
resolver anyway as a community we should

1474
01:05:27,509 --> 01:05:30,089
be documenting this I would love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

1475
01:05:28,829 --> 01:05:33,869
with you on that if your name is we

1476
01:05:30,089 --> 01:05:35,819
should be trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to UM basically settle</font>

1477
01:05:33,869 --> 01:05:38,819
on a solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> that works in every case</font>

1478
01:05:35,819 --> 01:05:41,519
not just on specific cases if i run a

1479
01:05:38,819 --> 01:05:44,969
caching resolver by myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted to</font>

1480
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:46,379
eat to perform well as well so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> dan</font>

1481
01:05:44,969 --> 01:05:48,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">york i wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just kind of say i</font>

1482
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:51,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">think you want to brings back to I think</font>

1483
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:53,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're asking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us right do we want to do</font>

1484
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:55,229
this work does the working group have

1485
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:58,079
interest in continuing this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

1486
01:05:55,229 --> 01:05:59,669
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to sleep and in right well I just</font>

1487
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">want say I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think from a process point of</font>

1488
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:03,599
view we're getting a lot of engineering

1489
01:06:01,079 --> 01:06:05,190
of solutions at the mics but I think the

1490
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:07,319
solution you're what you're looking for

1491
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:09,299
from us is do we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that and</font>

1492
01:06:07,319 --> 01:06:10,890
while I'm here I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will say yes I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1493
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:12,749
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is worthwhile to consider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

1494
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:14,430
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of concerns some of which have</font>

1495
01:06:12,749 --> 01:06:16,319
been raised<font color="#E5E5E5"> here by others here but I</font>

1496
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:18,058
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's worth exploring because if we</font>

1497
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:20,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at how we truly have a</font>

1498
01:06:18,059 --> 01:06:22,319
trusted DNS infrastructure this is one

1499
01:06:20,489 --> 01:06:24,599
place<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are exposing information</font>

1500
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:26,700
in ways that that need to be looked at

1501
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:29,069
what the solution is I looked it to the

1502
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:30,419
draft and you know I have opinions about

1503
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:32,460
various different once in there but I

1504
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:34,349
think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> worth having this group look</font>

1505
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:36,089
at that to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what could be there and I</font>

1506
01:06:34,349 --> 01:06:38,309
would echo the comments a couple people

1507
01:06:36,089 --> 01:06:39,569
made deployability will definitely be

1508
01:06:38,309 --> 01:06:41,489
something we need to be thinking about

1509
01:06:39,569 --> 01:06:43,650
but yes let's do it so yeah thank you

1510
01:06:41,489 --> 01:06:45,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">towards the very end of this and we've</font>

1511
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:47,069
still got some time and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1512
01:06:45,509 --> 01:06:48,779
have a we're planning on having a hum

1513
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:50,640
for yes the working group wants to carry

1514
01:06:48,779 --> 01:06:52,109
on working that on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we</font>

1515
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">might discover it's too hard but at</font>

1516
01:06:52,109 --> 01:06:56,460
least we should investigate it too nope

1517
01:06:54,990 --> 01:06:58,189
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a sleep for a year or so and</font>

1518
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:00,750
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe discuss this all again or</font>

1519
01:06:58,190 --> 01:07:02,730
three nope this is way too hard don't

1520
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:05,130
bother it's a stupid idea give up and

1521
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:07,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have that thing and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1522
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:13,140
we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> chat with our ad and see what he</font>

1523
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:15,180
wants us to do sorry Dickinson I just

1524
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:17,640
wanted to feed into the problem

1525
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:19,440
statement in terms of future proofing

1526
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:22,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">the dearness I mean no be really</font>

1527
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:24,690
anticipated the way individuals data was

1528
01:07:22,619 --> 01:07:27,119
going to be added into<font color="#E5E5E5"> e DNS client</font>

1529
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:28,619
subnet options and exposed recursive<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1530
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:30,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">authoritative and I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

1531
01:07:28,619 --> 01:07:33,150
the community community can anticipate

1532
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:35,460
future uses of that option to expose

1533
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:37,050
personal data so I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

1534
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:46,490
solid reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be doing this work now</font>

1535
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:49,170
rather than going to sleep anyone else

1536
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:50,339
this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last session on friday so i</font>

1537
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:52,770
guess we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only thing that's</font>

1538
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:56,369
standing between you and whatever else

1539
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:58,230
you want to do so does our ad have any

1540
01:07:56,369 --> 01:08:02,220
thoughts questions first or shall we try

1541
01:07:58,230 --> 01:08:04,859
this hungry I'm come do you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1542
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:07,319
no yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we're going to have a</font>

1543
01:08:04,859 --> 01:08:08,880
three-way hum first is going to be yes

1544
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:10,950
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> working group wants to continue</font>

1545
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:13,380
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this and you know discussing</font>

1546
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:14,609
stuff and then we'll be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font>

1547
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:18,390
out if it's too hard to actually

1548
01:08:14,609 --> 01:08:21,000
accomplish or not uh Oliver Oliver to

1549
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:23,640
Amazon Cloud for a quick quick question

1550
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:26,120
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say this do you mean solution</font>

1551
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:29,460
or figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what the problem is Oh</font>

1552
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:31,140
both I'm better defining what exactly

1553
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:33,060
we're trying to protect from recursive

1554
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:36,720
to auth basically the whole recursive to

1555
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:38,790
auth side what exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what needs to be</font>

1556
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:40,830
projected does everything need to be

1557
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:43,350
projected or<font color="#E5E5E5"> only you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high-value</font>

1558
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:44,850
things is there a signaling thing and

1559
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:46,350
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully once we've discovered</font>

1560
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:50,370
what the problem is work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a solution</font>

1561
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:52,350
so both sides the second part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the or</font>

1562
01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:54,390
yeah the second of the three hubs will

1563
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:56,400
be look we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should just go back to sleep</font>

1564
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:58,380
for a while and maybe in a year or two

1565
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:59,939
will wake up again and then start

1566
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:02,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that once we have some</font>

1567
01:08:59,939 --> 01:09:04,169
deployment experience and then the third

1568
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:06,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">option will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be nope this is really a</font>

1569
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:07,589
stupid idea or at armful to the internet

1570
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:09,560
let's not do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it let's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1571
01:09:07,589 --> 01:09:16,799
asset let's all go home and<font color="#CCCCCC"> go shopping</font>

1572
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:18,480
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's somewhat different 2 is we're</font>

1573
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:20,099
planning on probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> waking up again</font>

1574
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:23,729
which that of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> zombie right we're going</font>

1575
01:09:20,099 --> 01:09:25,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hiatus the idea being god no never</font>

1576
01:09:23,729 --> 01:09:27,899
touch this worst idea ever that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

1577
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:29,969
being that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1578
01:09:27,899 --> 01:09:32,219
operational experience yet with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sub</font>

1579
01:09:29,969 --> 01:09:34,109
to recurse in subject you know we don't

1580
01:09:32,219 --> 01:09:36,210
we haven't seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data yet and as an</font>

1581
01:09:34,109 --> 01:09:38,460
operational person that makes me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1582
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:39,509
little nervous<font color="#CCCCCC"> i I feel that it's</font>

1583
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:42,179
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to</font>

1584
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:45,210
scale at that level but until we until I

1585
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:46,889
think we see that we're making guesses

1586
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:49,649
as to what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the next step</font>

1587
01:09:46,889 --> 01:09:51,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that has me just a little bit</font>

1588
01:09:49,649 --> 01:09:52,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">concerned doesn't mean I want to stop it</font>

1589
01:09:51,179 --> 01:09:54,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">just means i got we want to make sure</font>

1590
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,699
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're sort of looking at the</font>

1591
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:59,099
problem in several different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

1592
01:09:56,699 --> 01:10:00,928
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suspect this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a hard problem and</font>

1593
01:09:59,099 --> 01:10:02,190
so by the time we get anywhere near

1594
01:10:00,929 --> 01:10:04,760
solving it we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some</font>

1595
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:09,509
deployment experience but joel has

1596
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:13,980
