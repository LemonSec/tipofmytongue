100
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:01,789
documents that are not being advanced by

101
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:11,880
by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing a DS so this was</font>

102
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:14,430
relatively well received so it actually

103
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:17,520
has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> chartered on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IHG</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> approved</font>

104
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:20,009
it as of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11 8 we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have two chairs</font>

105
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,460
installed you will notice one of them

106
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:25,259
looks kind of familiar um so well

107
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,380
actually both of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look familiar one</font>

108
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:31,530
of them is currently the chick currently

109
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:33,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">that chair here so that should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

110
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:38,580
little continuity you should give us

111
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:40,820
some fresh blood and I I think one of

112
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:44,219
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we now have to work on</font>

113
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:48,180
apart from actually starting this effort

114
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:50,940
is what do we do next so we have charter

115
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,610
items that take us through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of</font>

116
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:57,449
2017 most of those documents already

117
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:59,849
exist uh so the act of creating them and

118
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:01,710
bringing them to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group and</font>

119
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:05,570
asking for consensus to adopt them is

120
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,570
essentially already a solved problem and

121
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:15,030
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means what remains um is to do that</font>

122
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:17,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">work but I don't think cider Ops will be</font>

123
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:25,650
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> by any means just because those</font>

124
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:27,089
documents are completed so I would

125
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,469
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> recommend that people take a</font>

126
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:33,110
look at the Charter um as it exists now

127
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,780
take a look at the mailing list which is

128
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:42,710
fresh and shiny and you should join it

129
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:44,810
um and this effort will commence so I

130
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:47,060
think next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide please I think they</font>

131
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,560
should be done so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

132
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:53,410
documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were fed out of cider</font>

133

00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:44,360
because that<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff has to run and it</font>

146
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,890
means the research and measurement

147
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,000
community that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> working in the stuff</font>

148
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:52,100
all the time so I that definition should

149
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,690
actually cover pretty much everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

150
00:09:52,100 --> 00:10:01,310

153
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:12,800

154
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:14,570
who's gonna take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rest no I i hope i</font>

with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that expanded definition but are</font>

167
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,459
you also missing like regular kind of

168
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">isps network operators and I I think I</font>

169
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:02,489
think that was the one who is it i think

170
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:04,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the one we we started out with</font>

171
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:07,240
right those people are definitely

172
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:08,290
operators well I know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I I think</font>

173
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,569
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great that you've expanded that's</font>

174
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,860
good I was just curious it as i was

175
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:19,990
reading that is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like wait what</font>

176
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:21,699
about kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of regular but right so you</font>

177
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,290
know the operation of cider aware

178
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:28,389
networks is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where this comes</font>

179
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:32,009
from so uh that was intended to expand

180
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:32,009
the definition to include those folks

181
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:41,699
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right um yeah Tim ghazals records to</font>

182
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:44,290
see I had a question about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UM the</font>

183
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:46,508
the chart at work if you will or well

184
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,279
mature that's a correct phrase but the

185
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:51,069
the items that already listed for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

186
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:53,399
first milestone so how does it work if

187
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:56,500
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to bring a new work or</font>

188
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:59,050
unnaturally um so move some of the work

189
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:02,339
that's currently insider over because it

190
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:06,008
happens to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more operational yeah so a</font>

191
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:07,899
the current slider working group um in

192
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:12,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">my understanding is going to get closed</font>

193
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:16,720
down as soon as if not by the end of

194
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:20,290
this meeting as soon as the work items

195
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,680
that are passing through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isg are our</font>

196
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:28,680
proper properly processed um so if

197
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:31,810
you're considering new work you will uh

198
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,519
the way to ask if it's appropriate to do

199
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:37,329
it insider is to actually kind of look

200
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:42,579
at the Charter and see if it's so if

201
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:49,170
it's covered and then bring it to the

202
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:49,170
mailing list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can consider it</font>

dan York relaying for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sandy Murphy who</font>

204
00:12:53,410 --> 00:13:02,860
says must must<font color="#CCCCCC"> docs for cider ops be</font>

00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:05,229
resubmitted as dash 0 0 drafts um I

206
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,740
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we that's something that I</font>

207
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:10,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">will have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to discuss</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the with the</font>

208
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,460
working group chairs but I don't think

209
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:16,480
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's necessary for us to advance</font>

210
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:18,250
them right we can actually um all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

211
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually has to happen for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doctor</font>

212

advances that we move it into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

213
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:24,730
appropriate queue right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that we don't</font>

214
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:27,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the title to do that I</font>

215
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:30,400
can just make myself the responsible ad

216
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then click the button right so</font>

217
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,110
that's that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a I don't think</font>

218
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,450
there's a process impediment<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us you</font>

219
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">know us doing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay she's been she</font>

220
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,500
mentions there's 12 docs to go through

221
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,930
iesg it would take a bit of time or it

222
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,530
will I guess right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Micah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

223
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:48,880
expectation is not that we will just uh

224
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:50,550
abruptly closed down cider although

225
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,180
other people can do that if they want um

226
00:13:50,550 --> 00:14:01,719
but rather that it will remain open like

227
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:06,390
until such point as we see no major

228
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,390
impediments to advancing the work yep

229
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:16,380
thank you very much Declan excellent I

230

the term documented in intended for and

238
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:45,920
how it'll do it so motivation the

239
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:49,679
motivation is quite straightforward

240
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,929
people want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get some local control</font>

241
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:56,929
ability as far they are concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

242
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:59,999
the impact exerted by the RPK so okay ah

243
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:03,449
so for one thing network operators may

244
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:06,420
want to selectively a ride<font color="#E5E5E5"> zrk hierarchy</font>

287
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:41,980
it we all live a clear message here it's

288
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:47,920
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the four seconds next time</font>

practice um not being said about a BF

322
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:53,970

325
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:06,480
think a behalf is really really

326
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,059
indispensable as a full expressing the

327

initial logic of some configuration file

328
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:17,970
for one thing implementers have to write

329
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:22,320
into a code to make RP to execute a

330
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:25,080
certain function energies on Lou matter

331
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:29,789
which kind of configuration file you are

332
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:32,370
used and the some configuration file

333
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:37,289
itself doesn't tell how they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> P how</font>

a BF description

340
00:20:54,090 --> 00:21:02,000
in this document to express it the

341
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,000
essential logic of a slump file and

342
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:12,470
provide examples of configuration files

371
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,650
went unanswered but I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

372
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:08,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">express my opinion all shows I think</font>

373
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:12,220
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually very operational work</font>

374
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:17,559
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a applying local policy to</font>

375
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:21,100
relying party software so to me that has

376
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:22,800
a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good home in insider ops also I</font>

377
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,419
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is completely done yet</font>

378
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:28,030
so we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue discussion on it</font>

379
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:30,580
so that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first remark that I'd</font>

380
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:33,480
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make and that other people can</font>

381
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:40,120
express their opinions but that's mine

382
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:43,750
then so we actually have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing a</font>

383
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:49,659
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar thing in the ripe NCC aki I</font>

384
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:52,360
validated for many years now and so when

385
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:55,059
David made a document because ripster is

386
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:57,820
doing some of this as well and also for

387
00:23:55,059 --> 00:24:01,690
adoption i said let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

388
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:04,590
it's better to standardize with regards

389
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:08,320
to the semantics of how you should treat

390
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:10,990
essentially ignore filters I don't use

391
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,379
this that you find in the RBI these

392
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:18,880
these prefixes or these yes numbers and

393
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:21,910
let me add my local editions I have no

394
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,440
no problems with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document whatsoever</font>

395
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:25,570
it's actually exactly the same as what

396
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">we are doing but it's good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a</font>

397
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:33,970
defined what I do have an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> with is</font>

398
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:36,700
the the file format because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did talk</font>

399
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:41,080
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this before and well we can agree</font>

400
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:44,070
to disagree but I think it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be much</font>

401
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:47,409
better if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had in fact just one</font>

402
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:49,780
specification for this file format for

403
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:54,160
interoperability sake so you could use

404
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:56,350
one of you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> three in future</font>

405
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe more relying party tools that are</font>

406
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:00,770
out there and interface with them in a

407
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:04,889
similar way

408
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:06,980
the a B and F format that this gurney or

409
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:10,080
was in in the previous document at least

410
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:12,420
is well defined and<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

411
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,820
can be edited by humans but library

412
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:17,370
support for it is very limited so that's

413
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:21,389
why I wouldn't want to have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

414
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:24,139
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a format that is both it's</font>

415
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:29,340
easy to to read<font color="#E5E5E5"> and edit for humans but</font>

416
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:31,140
machines<font color="#CCCCCC"> alike of the other choices we</font>

417
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,550
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> through this on the in private</font>

418
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,880
conversation that I'm sharing this with

419
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:37,500
the group so you know yes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have</font>

420
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">XML but I don't think that's very good</font>

421
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,510
for humans either you can have Jason

422
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:45,870
which we are currently doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but still</font>

423
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:47,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">not ideal for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you for humans</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think of</font>

424
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:51,600
the choices there yellow is probably the

425
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,700
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's easy to add it easy to</font>

426
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,250
understand yet there are a ton of

427
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,720
libraries out there that allow you to

428
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,250
bosses will also generate this the

429
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,290
audience is important because part of

430
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:03,600
the updates go through user interface

431
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:05,730
not through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> command</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> line so we want</font>

432
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,270
to reliably write these things then

433
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:11,340
another thing in the content comments in

434
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:12,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the file are now just in the file I</font>

435
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,030
believe those should be first-class

436
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:17,659
citizens of the format<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can discuss</font>

437
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:21,300
this later as we continue this work but

438
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:23,990
then we can preserve them finally I want

439
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:26,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">to suggest future work on this as well</font>

440
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:29,190
because we're looking at the files now

441
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,110
but I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that an API that allows</font>

442
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:35,000
people to dynamically make changes like

443
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:38,010
this would also be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful work so</font>

444
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,080
thank you Jim um I totally agree with

445
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:43,710
you you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very helpful to this</font>

446
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:46,830
issue just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I may miss miss one thing I</font>

447
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:50,130
during<font color="#CCCCCC"> my presentation are we have</font>

448
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:54,990
difficult in providing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the abstract</font>

449
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:59,190
template for Jason for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> format</font>

450
00:26:54,990 --> 00:27:04,250
without providing a concrete usage you

451
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:07,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what I me a BF it's quite easy to</font>

452
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:11,720
express the essential logic<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you</font>

453
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:15,918
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a concrete eulogy well</font>

454
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:19,330
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah I thought I use the conclusion</font>

455
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:22,640
that we cannot specify this no you know

456
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:24,918
but I have omolade interactive we have

457
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:29,090
to use we have to choose one of the

458
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:31,850
three four mate I believe it's best to

459
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:33,949
only have one format in there I make the

460
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:36,049
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> choice based on something that is</font>

461
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:40,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">both you know easy to read from the</font>

462
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:42,980
machines<font color="#E5E5E5"> and easy to read for humans and</font>

463
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:45,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">generate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay look what was that choice</font>

464
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:48,770
I missed it my my my personal preference

465
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,480
would be you know and I don't want to

466
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:52,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">speak on Rob all scenes behalf but he</font>

467
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,860
made similar noises even though

468
00:27:52,309 --> 00:28:00,408
currently we used Jason I think it's not

469
00:27:54,860 --> 00:28:03,500
as human friendly oh please<font color="#CCCCCC"> will you</font>

470
00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:13,700
please go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us like would you want</font>

471
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:15,799
okay so yeah that's the rightmost

472
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,140
example there but it's a bit difficult

473
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:19,700
to read from here but in any case that's

474
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:22,460
a discussion we can continue on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list</font>

475
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,440
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's exemplify that I don't think</font>

476
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">his work is there yet I think it is</font>

477
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,390
going in the right direction and I would

478
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:32,270
love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to continue this work inside also</font>

479
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:34,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">but Kim out I want to be happy to see</font>

480
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:39,950
you help me with the issue to give me a

481
00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:43,970
to contribute I'll actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm on the</font>

482
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:47,179
list i suggested that it would be good

483
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:49,460
if all the major representatives from

484
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:52,789
the major relying party software tools

485
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:55,490
were authors on this document and work

486
00:28:52,789 --> 00:29:02,330
together and I would be happy to do so

487
00:28:55,490 --> 00:29:06,710
and contribute more right so will you go

488
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:11,120
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> deutsche telekom so let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me jump in</font>

489
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:14,570
with what is more a user view because

490
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:18,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm not developing the software though</font>

491
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:24,590
all ok<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have been facing problems like</font>

492
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:25,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">that first off quite clearly i agree</font>

493
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:32,959
fully

494
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:37,720
Tim there should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> one format your</font>

495
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:41,750
argument about you prefer a B and F and

496
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:46,429
you don't see anything that could kind

497
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:54,350
of have the semantics the explanations

498
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:57,230
tagged on is well actually I i have been

499
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:59,800
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> xml because i have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

500
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:05,300
for something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 10 years on defining</font>

501
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:11,330
structures and developing processes for

502
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:20,178
it schema and in and a grammar like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> b</font>

503
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:23,210
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> f is fairly equivalent and yes some</font>

504
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:26,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these formats that you are showing</font>

505
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:31,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are usually accompanied by a</font>

506
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:34,010
schema and some of these techniques

507
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:38,030
actually have supporting software where

508
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:47,950
you can put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> explanations and all that</font>

509
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:50,660
stuff in kind of kind of exposing

510
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:53,300
exposing the logic<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you are after is</font>

511
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:59,660
essentially the question of is there a

512
00:30:53,300 --> 00:31:01,820
schema accompanying the<font color="#CCCCCC"> format I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> miss</font>

513
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:05,890
law thank you for comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh I think</font>

514
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:11,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of be softened my argument I</font>

515
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:14,360
think is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ABF based description here</font>

516
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:21,169
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this tournament is not for the final</font>

517
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:26,270
use it just intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> Foley</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if I</font>

518
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:29,690
right relax<font color="#E5E5E5"> ng schema for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> XML it</font>

519
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:33,470
looks damned like a grammar like you're

520
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:38,120
a B and F and it also is not the final

521
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:39,020
format of what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going in there but</font>

522
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's defining</font>

523
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:46,340
the syntax and it and it exposes the

524
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:51,770
structure on which you want to tag on

525
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:54,500
the semantics ok and well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay for the</font>

526
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:57,160
other formats probably some way of

527
00:31:54,500 --> 00:32:00,230
defining a schema is also available

528
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:03,310
though at the moment the<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML actually</font>

529
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:06,560
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that better okay thank you um I'm</font>

530
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:11,060
open to this issue um I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> stubborn</font>

531
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:14,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">with uh with um the you teach our a BF</font>

532
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:18,020
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the release its</font>

533
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:21,620
occasion to the mentalist<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna have</font>

534
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:24,410
to yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> no yeah thank you i think that</font>

535
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:27,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be good and even if we don't have</font>

536
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:31,300
a formal definition of a llamo format

537
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:36,260
for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do a lot by</font>

538
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:38,090
by example and restricting things even

539
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:40,250
if a formal specification does not exist

540
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:42,320
i think we can please make an attempt to

541
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:47,240
define it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the document and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

542
00:32:42,320 --> 00:33:03,290
you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> pursue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that okay okay thank</font>

543
00:32:47,240 --> 00:33:05,750
you all right yeah Tim all right um yes

544
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:11,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">pick it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I cameras may be</font>

545
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:17,930
easier all right yes thanks that's the

546
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:19,850
slide so three validation I it is

547
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:25,010
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the documents that is</font>

548
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:29,090
listed<font color="#E5E5E5"> for sidewalks but let me talk</font>

549
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:31,910
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a bit again previous times</font>

550
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:34,399
we've talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the whole algorithm</font>

551
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:36,470
that we use etc etc so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't want to</font>

552
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,930
go into any of that right now I want to

553
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:41,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk a bit about the goals that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

554
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:42,470
at this document and the process and I

555
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:45,650
have a question for the working group

556
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:49,250
there or the future working group signed

557
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:50,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">also actually so first of all the title</font>

558
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,590
might be a bit misleading because it

559
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:55,950
says three validation but

560
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:57,720
it doesn't try to define how this should

561
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,370
be done it's not the best current

562
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,799
practices document it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a standard</font>

563
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:04,469
document it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an informational</font>

564
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:07,580
document and explained how<font color="#CCCCCC"> our specific</font>

565
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:09,960
implementing implementation works and

566
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:11,759
even though this title might be a bit

567
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,230
misleading or well the title<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

568
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,349
document<font color="#CCCCCC"> ism is leaving but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the short</font>

569
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:20,429
name of the file we've always been open

570
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:21,869
about this i believe and so why would we

571
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:23,730
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group with this work</font>

572
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:26,730
well we found it actually really

573
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:28,290
valuable because we want something we

574
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:30,300
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide transparency to the</font>

575
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:32,609
users of our software this is how it

576
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:36,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">works and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a review by</font>

577
00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:39,449
others that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> indeed okay so we</font>

578
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:41,909
got this review and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font>

579
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:46,009
the working group for that especially

580
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:48,089
also rob austin who's been doing

581
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:51,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">implementing some of the same ideas that</font>

582
00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:54,599
we had and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> steve can't who's</font>

583
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:59,160
provided a long list of comments

584
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:01,320
actually so what's important to note

585
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:04,170
though is that the document describes

586
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,490
what the software does so there may be

587
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,830
discussion about how it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

588
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:09,540
differently but the section that

589
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:11,640
describes of the software does is not

590
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,339
changed as a result what we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done in</font>

591
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:17,250
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> latest version and I submitted two</font>

592
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:20,820
weeks ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is that we have</font>

593
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:22,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">included comments in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the document where</font>

594
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,820
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know possible other</font>

595
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,550
concerns of other things you could be

596
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:29,040
doing we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to include</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that again to</font>

597
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:30,119
provide transparency but we didn't

598
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,250
change the text because our

599
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:38,040
implementation is actually doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it</font>

600
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:41,599
does so well that's one thing to frame

601
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:46,500
where this document is next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide please</font>

602
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:50,010
so a problem that I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to discuss with</font>

603
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:53,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">you is essentially this this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a moving</font>

604
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:55,530
goal or target I mean this document

605
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,480
describes what the software does right

606
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:59,609
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we intend to make changes in the</font>

607
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:03,450
future<font color="#E5E5E5"> small changes may be big changes</font>

608
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:05,430
and you know that goal will move so next

609
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:08,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide please</font>

610
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:10,629
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we deal with that going through</font>

611
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:13,419
the working groups is can be a bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

612
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:15,280
heavy process but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again we really like</font>

613
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:18,220
the transparency and the review so

614
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,870
that's why we're doing it so after

615
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,299
considering many options what we would

616
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:24,100
propose is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually build for</font>

617
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,400
last call on the current document pretty

618
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:28,960
soon this can also be in the inside odds

619
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,680
if people feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that their concerns are</font>

620
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,960
not properly represented in the document

621
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,149
then we can of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> revisit that but</font>

622
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,460
in the sense that it describes how the

623
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:42,910
software does and that won't change in

624
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:45,700
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next let's say six months I believe</font>

625
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:47,560
it can go final there for<font color="#E5E5E5"> future updates</font>

626
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:50,140
if they're minor what we could do is

627
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,820
just including with our release of the

628
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,470
software like you read me<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it does</font>

629
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:56,140
what this RFC says but there's some

630
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:58,029
minor changes here and there and if we

631
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:59,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">have enough of them and it stabilizes or</font>

632
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:03,240
if you have major changes we can take

633
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:05,650
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the sidewalks working group</font>

634
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,209
and then discuss with the working group

635
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:08,800
whether we should do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this or no</font>

636
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:10,300
document and<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether the working group</font>

637
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,570
wants to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all or we do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it as an</font>

638
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:15,460
individual submission even just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

639
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:18,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure that we do have a let's say</font>

640
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:20,650
independent document describing this

641
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:23,770
alternative to this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't do</font>

642
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:25,870
all this process and we just thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:28,509
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> group for all the work and we</font>

644
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:31,569
included document with each release and

645
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:34,480

646
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:37,840
course we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a formal review by</font>

647
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,700
others we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> providing transparency but</font>

648
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,200
it's you just have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to believe us on the</font>

649
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:44,080
word when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> read this document so it's</font>

650
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,870
less ideal in a way so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was just</font>

651
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:49,660
wondering where people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this working</font>

652
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:52,270
group stand and equal insider ops will

653
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:54,640
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> standing on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this do you have</font>

654
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:59,080
preferences ideas about this I would

655
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:01,980
love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear and that's it questions</font>

656
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,980
comments

657
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:14,220
anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't really give me an</font>

658
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:18,840
answer to my mind question on whether

659
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:20,700
the proposal that I did actually is go

660
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,770
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> law school and deal with updates</font>

661
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,330
yeah leave this here does this work<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

662
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:32,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">people or do you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it should be done</font>

663
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:36,990
differently video<font color="#E5E5E5"> photos telecom I think</font>

664
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:39,990
it works ah at some point in time I

665
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:45,060
would guess that you will rather switch

666
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:51,779
to your users forum for the for asking

667
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:59,009
for feedback but as we start up side or

668
00:38:51,780 --> 00:39:03,690
ops and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user base may not have that</font>

669
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:08,520
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> expertise in looking at all the</font>

670
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:12,840
critical places I think kind of

671
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:17,130
reviewing here or insider ops should be

672
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:27,210
fine and not not every revision actually

673
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:29,880
has to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our FC transcoder um as</font>

674
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:32,120
long as people<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do the review in</font>

675
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:36,540
the group it seems great i<font color="#E5E5E5"> will say it's</font>

676
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:38,460
unique in my experience to for a you

677
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:41,550
know vendor or software project or

678
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:44,910
whatever to make use of the IETF

679
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:47,040
publication process as a way of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

680
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:49,470
doing q a review for their product but

681
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:56,490
you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> people want to do it seems</font>

682
00:39:49,470 --> 00:40:00,959
like doesn't hurt anyone so go crazy<font color="#CCCCCC"> dan</font>

683
00:39:56,490 --> 00:40:03,029
York relaying for<font color="#CCCCCC"> sandy Murphy Oh two</font>

684
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,040
things I guess she said I can see

685
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:08,010
benefit to have a standard set of topics

686
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,410
to be covered in any such implementation

687
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:13,470
description she thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> rüdiger said</font>

688
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:15,540
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that once and she also</font>

689
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:16,589
asks would a wiki be better than a

690
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,570
document

691
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:20,550
a DS have recommended wiki as a

692
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:23,120
substitute for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous routing</font>

693
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:25,320
desire for implementation reports

694
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:35,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">parentheses and implementation report</font>

696
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:43,080
DRL um John I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we've got many</font>

697
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:47,100
examples of um while just run companies

698
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:52,460
implementation of protocol X and father

699
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:52,460
strong<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies protocol</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X as RFC's</font>

700
00:40:54,500 --> 00:41:00,900
yeah yeah it's a stock way of doing it

701
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:03,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that's I think that path Tim's</font>

702
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:09,480
taking what's confusing us here is um

703
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:12,360
he's proposing a moving target well yes

704
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,830
because implementation will change in

705
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,750
future I don't want to go in details now

706
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:20,730
but we have many ideas of things that we

707
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:24,360
could be doing differently regarding

708
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:26,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">wiki's or user forum um the point is</font>

709
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,900
this describes just the validation

710
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:29,400
process right it doesn't describe

711
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,700
everything of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the software it's very</font>

712
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,680
specific on that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> judging whether</font>

713
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:38,189
that is a correct way to do things

714
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:42,990
requires very good knowledge of how dr

715
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:47,460
BR works so in that sense I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

716
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:51,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the user forum</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would work I'm not</font>

717
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:54,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure how to wikis work in the ITF but</font>

718
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:56,610
because it describes what we actually do

719
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,920
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the other token on it</font>

720
00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:00,840
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you cannot just change</font>

721
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,190
it and then our software does something

722
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:07,590
that's different suddenly that's not how

723
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:09,210
it works right so I would prefer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font>

724
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:11,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">control of the document but have some</font>

725
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:13,500
form of processing and another

726
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:15,870
suggestion earlier was that maybe we

727
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,880
accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it never gets to RFC but we</font>

728
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:19,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">just have a document that gets updated</font>

729
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,990
you spin up a new version and you says

730
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,850
well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a living document that would</font>

731
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:26,129
also work for me if that works<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

732
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:28,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">working group but ok maybe you should</font>

733
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:29,850
wrap up because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we get all</font>

734
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:30,540
those things answered right here but I

735
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:33,480
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

736
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:37,259
the question really explicit for you

737
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:40,200
guys so what do you think should<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just</font>

738
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:42,390
addresses inside off Stan and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask how to</font>

739
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">proceed should we go for law school on</font>

740
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:47,190
this one so we have a baseline and then

741
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:49,620
continuing with future work that would

742
00:42:47,190 --> 00:43:02,940
kind of have my preference<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have</font>

743
00:42:49,620 --> 00:43:05,220
something wrapped up surely a glee um I

744
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,870
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are open questions there are</font>

745
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:09,390
certainly things that we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask the</font>

746
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:10,710
mailing list you probably want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font>

747
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:12,359
when it's slightly more populated

748
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:16,680
because it will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit of an echo</font>

749
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:19,260
chamber at the moment but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

750
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:22,200
perfectly legitimate given that expired

751
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:24,450
RFC's<font color="#CCCCCC"> number or RFC's expired drafts</font>

752
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:34,710
never really disappear at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

753
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:36,960
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah a draft at a particular revision</font>

754
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:41,370
will be quite some stable for some time

755
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,290
so like<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you want if you want to treat</font>

756
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:46,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">it like that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's fine and</font>

757
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:48,960
that actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> requires no consensus well</font>

758
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:52,590
but that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is part of the problem because</font>

759
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,820
then if you do finalize it then you can

760
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:55,800
demonstrate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've gone through a</font>

761
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:57,960
consensus process and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people agree</font>

762
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,450
that it describes what you need to

763
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,980
describe right well so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

764
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:03,899
question that we can ask at that time

765
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:08,190
right because one of the problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

766
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:10,350
asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for consensus is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rest of the</font>

767
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:14,340
community at that time as opposed to say

768
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:18,210
now is inclined to make changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

769
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:21,420
aren't because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you know your thing</font>

770
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:24,420
then then that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really a consensus</font>

771
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:28,050
process but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again that's a bridge we</font>

772
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:31,800
could cross at some future time without

773
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:34,290
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve it today sure but let me</font>

774
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,450
just allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> me two new ones that a bit</font>

775
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:38,580
because I feel that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if people see</font>

776
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:41,370
blocking issues with our implementation

777
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:43,080
I really would like them to speak up and

778
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:44,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to call this final and I</font>

779
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,450
would want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change the song</font>

780
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:47,920
if there's difference in opinion of you

781
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,479
could go left or right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no</font>

782
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,329
not really clear what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the best way</font>

783
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:55,419
then I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we do yeah</font>

784
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:58,119
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> when this is instantiated you</font>

785
00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:01,720
could ask for you could ask the then

786
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:09,970
chairs um for adoption which would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

787
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:25,359
way to call that a forcing function well

788
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:28,859
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks Sam and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oliver hello my</font>

789
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:32,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">name is Oliver boy yet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm vez NIST I'm</font>

790
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:34,479
presenting today the latest status of

791
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:37,629
the beach<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece a complementation and</font>

792
00:45:34,479 --> 00:45:40,598
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kabaka IX implementation we also</font>

793
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:42,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a cert I would say like a half b2b</font>

794
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:45,519
second plement<font color="#CCCCCC"> Asians called bgp SE cayo</font>

795
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:50,109
which is the traffic generator next

796
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:53,439
slide please so just very quick bgp

797
00:45:50,109 --> 00:45:56,979
sekai Oh allows you to very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easily</font>

798
00:45:53,440 --> 00:46:01,749
generate<font color="#CCCCCC"> large scale which agrees heck</font>

799
00:45:56,979 --> 00:46:05,529
traffic you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can script it very easily it</font>

800
00:46:01,749 --> 00:46:08,169
can receive be to be checked traffic and

801
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:10,900
print it out in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of Wireshark</font>

802
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:12,849
form we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> print out every little</font>

803
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:15,729
thing like MP NRI or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

804
00:46:12,849 --> 00:46:19,210
but we focus mainly on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP sec path</font>

805
00:46:15,729 --> 00:46:21,968
attribute it as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said very easy to</font>

806
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:24,700
configure has configuration script goes

807
00:46:21,969 --> 00:46:28,839
your command line you can pipe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pipe</font>

808
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:32,319
in traffic etc if you're more than that

809
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:34,029
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> grab me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after that and then I</font>

810
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:38,079
control your we can talk a little bit

811
00:46:34,029 --> 00:46:40,710
about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it also can test just</font>

812
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:43,359
crypto modules for bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> zach parsing so</font>

813
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:46,329
what that means is in the quagga<font color="#CCCCCC"> RX</font>

814
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:48,700
implementation we extract with our

815
00:46:46,329 --> 00:46:51,460
crypto apart so quagga basically just

816
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:53,439
started as a policy processing and the

817
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:56,769
beach exact path processing to the

818
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,550
extent it needs to basically mix index

819
00:46:56,769 --> 00:46:59,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">check and so forth</font>

820
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:01,240
but then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just hand over the whole</font>

821
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:03,400
BJP's egg path attribute into a crypto

822
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:05,470
module what then can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be changed easily</font>

823
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,510
with plugins and something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that so</font>

824
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:09,189
this tool can basically just make these

825
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:11,650
calls and doesn't have to talk bgp as

826
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:14,050
well what is very good for if you want

827
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:17,530
to make speed tests or performance

828
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:19,330
improvements next slide so what I want

829
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:23,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show today is just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very simple</font>

830
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:25,390
topology from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> s-10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to as50 we have</font>

831
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:28,210
traffic generated by akka wakka SRX

832
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:31,180
these three guesses on the left side it

833
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:33,490
goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a bird to another Bertram the</font>

834
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:36,250
quagga a text another<font color="#CCCCCC"> kaka SRX we have</font>

835
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:39,569
one row in the system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that allows s10 to</font>

836
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:44,140
produce at to announce these three

837
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:46,060
prefixes then we have a is 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> PSP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gp's</font>

838
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:50,319
a guy or bad guy wants to hijack the

839
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:52,480
traffic next slide so if you have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

840
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,580
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer it's sometimes a little</font>

841
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:58,990
bit difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know follow everything</font>

842
00:47:54,580 --> 00:48:00,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would recommend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay on slide 4 so</font>

843
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:01,839
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what what's going on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

844
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:04,540
what do you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the very top is</font>

845
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:07,870
basically all the windows of the of the

846
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:10,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">a s instances you have 10 20 30 know 10</font>

847
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:13,330
20 40 and 50 then on the upper right we

848
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:15,940
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like a our peak I cash test</font>

849
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:20,380
harness kind of thing maybe can inject

850
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:21,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ross with rpki protocol we do not make</font>

851
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:24,700
any validation of something it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

852
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:28,810
very simple whitelist generator that

853
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:30,790
feeds into the quagga s4x then

854
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:34,120
underneath there you see the h100 that's

855
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:36,450
the bgp sekai oh then we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 31 1</font>

856
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:39,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">birt instance and determined it to as50</font>

857
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:41,529
the terminal<font color="#E5E5E5"> Swift is just to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

858
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:47,470
in the very end the traffic goes in and

859
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:50,440
get validated my next slide so I start

860
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:52,839
everything up and you see on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> is 30</font>

861
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,450
that's a convert implementation you see

862
00:48:52,840 --> 00:49:00,100
the past coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> as each three prefix</font>

863
00:48:55,450 --> 00:49:02,529
coming in via 1020 they're validated

864
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:05,290
valid then in as50 you see the whole

865
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:07,810
path and everything is well it as well

866
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:11,259
to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one very quick to explanation in</font>

867
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:13,600
progress or<font color="#CCCCCC"> X we have you have the V</font>

868
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:16,690
then you have the brackets VV so in

869
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,130
quagga SRX basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> combined origin</font>

870
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:20,230
validation wispy to protect pass

871
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:22,930
validation and you can turn off one

872
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:24,970
thing turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the other thing and then</font>

873
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:27,640
we calculate out of this overall

874
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:30,339
validation of the update so the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> V</font>

875
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:34,120
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> spacing the overall validation valid</font>

876
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:37,120
the second v is the RP<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cairo validation</font>

877
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:40,600
we saw it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the third V is basically be</font>

878
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:44,650
to be sick pass validation next slide so

879
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:48,549
then I<font color="#CCCCCC"> go back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to ace 40 I you see there</font>

880
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:52,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">ace next slide so you see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here as well</font>

881
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:56,020
we have 10 20 30 now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in s40 sorry</font>

882
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:58,570
next slide so now we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add the</font>

883
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:00,280
traffic if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look up there and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> das 100</font>

884
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:02,640
slide so we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be to be sick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i 0</font>

885
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:08,230
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> V announced exactly the same</font>

886
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:10,480
prefixes next slide so down<font color="#E5E5E5"> here now on</font>

887
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:12,730
the terminal of s40 which is connected

888
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:16,860
to ace 100 you see basically it<font color="#CCCCCC"> received</font>

889
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:19,090
the additional three updates next slide

890
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:22,980
so it makes it a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit bigger so</font>

891
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:25,630
you see the in if you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're not</font>

892
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:28,090
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't if you didn't see the</font>

893
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:31,230
quagga output<font color="#E5E5E5"> before so this is a s path</font>

894
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:34,480
and over there's basically the previous

895
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:37,150
the greater than sign is basically

896
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,730
showing is selected path you see that in

897
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:41,860
all three instances stills along a path

898
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:44,440
is selected even though the pass

899
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:46,870
validation was successful because it was

900
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:50,380
a s100 they denounced it it used its own

901
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:54,730
key it could be validated but the origin

902
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:55,840
validation complained because we didn't

903
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:58,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">hit the raw for that so the whole</font>

904
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:01,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">updated self is invalid and our policies</font>

905
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:06,939
prefer well it and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> select the</font>

906
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:09,400
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide so sorry so the prefix I</font>

907
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:12,510
Drake was unsuccessful pass validation

908
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:16,360
pass but the original iteration failed

909
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:19,170
excellent so now we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a is 100</font>

910
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,170
becomes a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

911
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:27,200
he announces or heap repents a is 10 and

912
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:29,359
analysis into hope to that now now to be

913
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:32,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">successful with origin meditation next</font>

914
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:35,930
slide so we stopped everything you see

915
00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:39,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">again that on is 40 the announced trout</font>

916
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:41,779
sorry strong next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide the new</font>

917
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:45,470
announcements are done now what you see

918
00:51:41,779 --> 00:51:51,140
is basically we receive next slide we

919
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:52,399
receive path 110 listed prefix and you

920
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:55,549
see in the validation now the original

921
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:58,999
iteration past but the path relation

922
00:51:55,549 --> 00:52:02,299
fade excellent that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> address that</font>

923
00:51:58,999 --> 00:52:04,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">next slide so that was just very briefly</font>

924
00:52:02,299 --> 00:52:06,740
to show you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to</font>

925
00:52:04,099 --> 00:52:19,700
implementation that can do what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

926
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:21,499
intend to do and question<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright no</font>

927
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:24,109
questions everyone kept track of what

928
00:52:21,499 --> 00:52:25,609
was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on pass validation origin</font>

929
00:52:24,109 --> 00:52:32,259
validation both working seems pretty

930
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:43,130
cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright thanks Oliver alright uh</font>

931
00:52:32,259 --> 00:52:48,349
Randy and maybe Tim because the comic

932
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:56,390
sans in the purple only one<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

933
00:52:48,349 --> 00:53:02,259
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up though you spoke up not my</font>

934
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:11,328
fault somebody's got to stand in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

935
00:53:02,259 --> 00:53:13,670
projector box I don't so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um the last</font>

936
00:53:11,329 --> 00:53:15,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting we made the mistake I work in</font>

937
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:19,759
the NOC I can stand wherever the hell I

938
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:23,808
want at the last meeting I made a

939
00:53:19,759 --> 00:53:26,029
mistake of standing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and saying um how</font>

940
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:28,819
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we testing all this crud thank you</font>

941
00:53:26,029 --> 00:53:33,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">for Oliver for giving one example and an</font>

942
00:53:28,819 --> 00:53:35,709
excellent delicious one um and somehow

943
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:38,529
the chairs got it in their minds that we

944
00:53:35,709 --> 00:53:42,939
should talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it um so we'll try to</font>

945
00:53:38,529 --> 00:53:45,789
do so um what are the pieces that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

946
00:53:42,939 --> 00:53:50,399
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> of so far and this is not an</font>

947
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:54,640
exhaustive list um seeing that ca's

948
00:53:50,399 --> 00:53:58,689
interoperate seeing that caches all

949
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:03,390
produce the same result right would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

950
00:53:58,689 --> 00:54:12,219
nice aside from issues of times Q right

951
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:16,529
do caches fetch from each other can they

952
00:54:12,219 --> 00:54:21,130
in my you know I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big isp my</font>

953
00:54:16,529 --> 00:54:23,739
near my<font color="#CCCCCC"> routers walled off right I let</font>

954
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:26,529
very little through I would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

955
00:54:23,739 --> 00:54:29,890
caches in that rack to talk two caches

956
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:33,099
in another rack but not glow to the go

957
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:36,908
to the global rpki how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that work</font>

958
00:54:33,099 --> 00:54:42,459
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> now with the change to rdp we</font>

959
00:54:36,909 --> 00:54:45,039
understood it with our sink okay um the

960
00:54:42,459 --> 00:54:48,158
routers produce consistent results at

961
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:51,130
all and do they produce it with

962
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:53,349
consistent with multiple caches and do

963
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:57,459
routers actually do their job clicky

964
00:54:53,349 --> 00:55:02,229
wiki thank you um so let's talk about

965
00:54:57,459 --> 00:55:06,098
certificate authority testing um do the

966
00:55:02,229 --> 00:55:09,308
actual cas and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure this list is</font>

967
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:13,239
exhausted<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh no AP nick has a separate</font>

968
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:16,899
CA I think I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> um etc do those cas</font>

969
00:55:13,239 --> 00:55:21,279
interoperate and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example right now</font>

970
00:55:16,899 --> 00:55:25,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">put please we have an example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where ripe</font>

971
00:55:21,279 --> 00:55:28,479
has a child and that child has a child

972
00:55:25,029 --> 00:55:31,539
so that's right interacting with

973
00:55:28,479 --> 00:55:34,089
dragging labs interacting with dragon

974
00:55:31,539 --> 00:55:37,149
webs vertically as in the right hand

975
00:55:34,089 --> 00:55:40,479
side there but what happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you've</font>

976
00:55:37,149 --> 00:55:44,729
got somebody big like AT&T who has

977
00:55:40,479 --> 00:55:46,890
resources from right and for Marin and

978
00:55:44,729 --> 00:55:51,680
other are

979
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:54,990
I hours of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course and may have also RFC</font>

980
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:59,220
1918 resources that they want to

981
00:55:54,990 --> 00:56:04,078
validate in tournament<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what hat</font>

982
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:08,029
so does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work we don't know we hope</font>

983
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:13,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">so this is would be a very typical</font>

984
00:56:08,029 --> 00:56:16,160
scenario for a large provider like<font color="#E5E5E5"> rue</font>

985
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:21,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">de Gru's nodding his head vigorously</font>

986
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:23,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and we should be testing this in q1</font>

987
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:28,618
and reporting in Chicago<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if this</font>

988
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:31,140
isn't working<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're in deep doo-doo can</font>

989
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:35,099
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask a clarifying question want to ask</font>

990
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:37,980
another yes so this isn't this is work

991
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:40,529
you're proposing for cider ops to be

992
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:42,690
have a report in Chicago yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's work</font>

993
00:56:40,529 --> 00:56:45,750
i'm proposing i don't give a damn okay

994
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:49,079
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the administrative locale</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

995
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:55,339
discussion chicago's bad enough the

996
00:56:49,079 --> 00:57:00,450
other aspects okay I've lived in Chicago

997
00:56:55,339 --> 00:57:02,849
okay so um validators caches whatever we

998
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:06,569
call them today they produce consistent

999
00:57:02,849 --> 00:57:10,079
results um we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> J broken</font>

00:57:06,569 --> 00:57:14,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">Haggadah AT&T is actually working on</font>

1001
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:20,759
this and testing and and um occasionally

1002
00:57:14,009 --> 00:57:23,269
we find surprises so um<font color="#CCCCCC"> so now this this</font>

1003
00:57:20,759 --> 00:57:31,549
one's a Tim you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to speak to it Tim</font>

1004
00:57:23,269 --> 00:57:33,660
yeah good Tim<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I are actually</font>

1008
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,269

00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:50,940
know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting topic</font>

1013
00:57:54,569 --> 00:58:00,100
they they fetch data they do validation

1014
00:57:56,670 --> 00:58:04,030
and then as far that speaks with Reuters

1015

or get spoken to by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Naruto's be but you</font>

1016
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:07,300
could also check that out you could

1017
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:08,800
spare these functions out and something

1018
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,300
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just concerned with fetching</font>

1022
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:20,049

that data you may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use to for</font>

1024
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:25,510
redundancy and then that data the

1025
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:28,120
validated data itself may go to caches

1026
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:29,710
that are closer to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reuters whose</font>

00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:35,400
that to Reuters so you isolate these

00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:37,900

00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:57,480
pay for it is the first is actually

1036
00:58:53,140 --> 00:59:00,879
useful in large ISPs who should not put

1037
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:05,620
you know should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple externally</font>

1038
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:08,560
facing fetchers separating the second

00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:12,880
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> third bothers me because I don't</font>

1040
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:15,610

1041
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:20,710
validation right near my router because

1042
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:24,250
the rpki router protocol strips all the

1043
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:28,390
crypto the router is betting its lunch

1044
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:31,150
on the validator so but that's just a

1045
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:34,450
personal opinion and I imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> folk um</font>

1046
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:36,100
could have scenarios in which they would

1047
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:41,319
be more<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable breaking all three</font>

1048
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:43,120
pieces out but if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um this is</font>

1049
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:48,070
some more interesting interoperability

1050
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:52,150
testing what happens if we want Tim's

fetcher with Rob I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> steins validator</font>

1052
00:59:52,150 --> 01:00:04,180
with you know some arbitrary cash thank

1053
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:07,960
you sir so rather testing um do routers

1054
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:09,790
perform correctly we want to measure the

1055
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:13,690
semantics I'm not so much interested in

1056
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:16,720
speed I think we want continual

1057
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:19,990
regression testing right all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us were</font>

1058
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:22,569
of any scale have labs with stacks of

1059
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:26,830
routers that we're constantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> beating to</font>

1060
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:30,700
death to see that last move tears bugs

1061
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:35,259
are still there and um but they haven't

1062
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:41,049
improved next please so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:48,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">fantasy of mine I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had back in 2013 um</font>

1064
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:51,790
and it's it's stolen um from some I was

1065
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:57,670
born<font color="#E5E5E5"> a compiler writer and this is kind</font>

1066
01:00:51,790 --> 01:01:00,490
of model of a harness from the 70s from

1067
01:00:57,670 --> 01:01:03,400
the 70s from compiler validation tools

1068
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:05,080
where you have the device<font color="#E5E5E5"> under test you</font>

1069
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:07,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">have stuff driving it you have stuff</font>

1070
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:10,480
receiving from it you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> test</font>

1071
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:13,390
definitions control etc etc results

1072
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:16,030
reports and and we hope that this is

1073
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:21,120
well digested and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to read</font>

1074
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:25,270
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those pages of reports okay next and</font>

1075
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:29,950
so the assumption isn't in that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1076
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:34,000
the rpki implementation itself um is

1077
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:37,060
tested and the caches are tested and the

1078
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:40,180
RPK are out of protocol services tested

1079
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:43,509
so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can control the cache content</font>

1080
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:47,980
and change it and watch the router

1081
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:51,070
behave<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we can control the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP feed</font>

1082
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:53,530
at a very fine granularity and watch the

1083
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:55,810
router behave and I'll leave this up for

1084
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:59,110
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment or two there's actually a doc</font>

1085
01:01:55,810 --> 01:02:02,440
file with some suggestions for testing

1086
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:11,170
progress etc etc somebody wants to fetch

1087
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:15,520
that URL um yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so how to test these</font>

1088
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:18,610
things reproducibly and constantly to

1089
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:21,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">insure against regression and making</font>

1090
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:26,020
sure nobody's ever fixing their bugs dan

1091
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:27,099
actually Dan being sandy she says about

1092
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:30,130
flexible

1093
01:02:27,099 --> 01:02:33,029
hash typologies seems one scenario to

1094
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:36,130
support was bringing up brand new isp

1095
01:02:33,029 --> 01:02:38,410
getting rpki data when it did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1096
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:46,960
global routing working but had a local

1097
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:49,779
connection to a neighbor or I XP yeah um

1098
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:55,229
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> my memory is things are designed</font>

1099
01:02:49,779 --> 01:03:01,210
to come up with no cash for validation

1100
01:02:55,229 --> 01:03:03,129
because they'll all be not what's the

1101
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:05,890
state unknown or whatever we call that

1102
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:15,910
unknown state and you'll probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> route</font>

1103
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:25,618
on it and and my mind though<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ruettiger</font>

1104
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:30,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">is thinking this is dangerous I think</font>

1105
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:36,789
that question<font color="#CCCCCC"> may pour it into the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> area</font>

1106
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:40,210
of oil<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how is how is a resource</font>

happening in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rpki about his resource</font>

1109
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:52,869
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to be represented somehow</font>

1110
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:55,629
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> well okay that representation will</font>

1111
01:03:52,869 --> 01:04:02,769
have some consequences in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the evaluation</font>

1112
01:03:55,630 --> 01:04:08,979
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess that point of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> view is kind</font>

1113
01:04:02,769 --> 01:04:13,569
of not yet covered by cider and future

1114
01:04:08,979 --> 01:04:16,660
all ok the discussion so far and<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1115
01:04:13,569 --> 01:04:19,109
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> your and your testing scenarios as</font>

1116
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:24,640
well so how do i as a resource holder

1117
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:26,589
query the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RP aki global view to see what</font>

1118
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:30,910
the scary is about my<font color="#CCCCCC"> answers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in check</font>

1119
01:04:26,589 --> 01:04:35,049
and check that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cas that take care of</font>

1120
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:37,960
representing my resource as a day off

1121
01:04:35,049 --> 01:04:40,299
maybe maybe misrepresenting what I

1122
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,839
wanted well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CAS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ho have wonderful</font>

1123
01:04:40,299 --> 01:04:44,469
gooeys

1124
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:46,509
which lie to me um and so what you're

1125
01:04:44,469 --> 01:04:50,049
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the rpki</font>

01:04:50,049 --> 01:04:56,680
tools to do so that i'm aware of<font color="#CCCCCC"> jim of</font>

1128
01:04:52,089 --> 01:04:58,630
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i haven't I just wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

01:05:25,239 --> 01:05:33,069
allows you to connect its brightness

1138
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:36,759
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> NT do that mr.</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cough and it</font>

1139
01:05:33,069 --> 01:05:40,150
allows you to connect your outer against

1140
01:05:36,759 --> 01:05:44,289
a test system and then we sent you brrp

1141
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:46,749
ki protocol some<font color="#CCCCCC"> ross we sent you some</font>

1142
01:05:44,289 --> 01:05:50,759
traffic and we see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sent back</font>

1143
01:05:46,749 --> 01:05:55,529
and then we give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little report if</font>

1144
01:05:50,759 --> 01:05:59,769
what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> sent back was what we expected</font>

1145
01:05:55,529 --> 01:06:04,059
so that might be an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting thing to</font>

1146
01:05:59,769 --> 01:06:06,279
look in what you sent back in terms of

1147
01:06:04,059 --> 01:06:09,190
the RPK so basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call</font>

1148
01:06:06,279 --> 01:06:13,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">responds yeah so basically we monitor</font>

1149
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:16,359
p2p for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a b2b for traffic so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i sent you</font>

1150
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:19,210
I I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect for example against</font>

1151
01:06:16,359 --> 01:06:21,249
three routers and one of them is a

1152
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:22,569
monitor and then the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> two one sent</font>

1153
01:06:21,249 --> 01:06:25,238
for example longer path the other one

1154
01:06:22,569 --> 01:06:27,579
too short a path then we sent you the so

1155
01:06:25,239 --> 01:06:30,099
normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> you select</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the shorter path and</font>

1156
01:06:27,579 --> 01:06:33,039
then we send you raw for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

1157
01:06:30,099 --> 01:06:35,229
longer one and then we see if how do you

1158
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:37,479
deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this now there's a row of</font>

1159
01:06:35,229 --> 01:06:40,529
having to you switch over<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the shorter</font>

1160
01:06:37,479 --> 01:06:43,210
path etc etc and that tool can be

1161
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:44,440
extended there's like a complete

1162
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:50,160
scripting language or something like

1163
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:50,160
that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> source while looking into and</font>

1164
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:56,089
back then we it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the namek and</font>

1165
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:58,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">Philadelphia I think yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1166
01:06:56,090 --> 01:07:01,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">presented it but at this time nobody</font>

1167
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:03,980
really thought about our<font color="#E5E5E5"> peak I and it</font>

1168
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:05,930
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit before our time so but</font>

1169
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:08,870
I think right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's a good</font>

1170
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:10,640
tool what one can go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1171
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:12,140
is there more what we need maybe more

1172
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:15,310
tests because we only have a very short

1173
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:20,049
or very small amount of tests in there

1174
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:23,930
but yeah that sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a good start</font>

1175
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:26,690
um yeah actually that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fits quite well</font>

1176
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:31,879
into what i wanted to say about this

1177
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:35,710
because so how to test I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1178
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:38,930
sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the component also from our</font>

1179
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:40,970
perspective I'm not sure how much time I

1180
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:44,029
my cell I myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my team might have</font>

1181
01:07:40,970 --> 01:07:47,120
for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> going into Chicago to set up a</font>

1182
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:48,620
test framework itself it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something</font>

1183
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:52,790
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we normally do but what we would</font>

1184
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:54,589
quite happily do is act as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> opt-in CA</font>

1185
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:56,870
and have our<font color="#E5E5E5"> validates around there and</font>

1186
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:59,390
look into<font color="#E5E5E5"> any issues that might be</font>

1187
01:07:56,870 --> 01:08:01,700
revealed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see very big value in</font>

1188
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:03,470
for us also<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know when we do future</font>

1189
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:05,870
releases of the relying party software i

1190
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:08,839
see this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good thing to have</font>

1191
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:10,580
you know does it work as respect as

1192
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:12,920
expected<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course we do our own testing</font>

1193
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:25,510
about having something extra it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

1194
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:31,370
useful and this is the obvious question

1195
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:33,080
now for the bureaucratic overhead how

1196
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:40,460
the heck do we organize to get this done

1197
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:42,470
um I'll Tim<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I are hoping to do Tim</font>

1198
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:46,880
and Rob Austin and I are hoping to do

1199
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:49,610
some CA interoperability testing as I

1200
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:53,690
said beyond<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have no specific</font>

1201
01:08:49,609 --> 01:08:54,979
plans so for Matthews just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick</font>

1202
01:08:53,689 --> 01:08:57,559
suggestion have you considered

1203
01:08:54,979 --> 01:08:59,750
approaching UNH for this type of

1204
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:02,690
interrupt testing right that's that

1205
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:05,109
that's big data flop I ask who you are

1206
01:09:02,689 --> 01:09:09,269
and where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're from oh we did you sir</font>

1207
01:09:05,109 --> 01:09:11,980
about his nokia yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry so anyway uh</font>

1208
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:14,049
you know I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> their do all sorts of</font>

1209
01:09:11,979 --> 01:09:15,278
testing in this type of stuff oh not

1210
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:21,609
this type of stuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do all</font>

1211
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:42,969
sortsa history are you in a position to

1212
01:09:21,609 --> 01:09:45,880
ping them to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mic Carlos you</font>

1213
01:09:42,969 --> 01:09:56,619
folk think you're playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with any of</font>

1214
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:59,139
this karla martinez latnok we definitely

1215
01:09:56,619 --> 01:10:01,119
see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> value of this but I share the</font>

1216
01:09:59,139 --> 01:10:04,330
same concern esteem and I don't know how

1217
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:08,519
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> time my time we my team will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1218
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:10,750
to put into such a project however and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1219
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:13,750
think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should keep actually working on</font>

1220
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:16,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and perhaps come up with a list of</font>

1221
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:19,330
more detail activities so we can

1222
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:20,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually make a decision on that I think</font>

1223
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:26,800
we're all agreed it's worthwhile

1224
01:10:20,409 --> 01:10:28,000
activity for somebody else to do I don't

1225
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,580
want to commit<font color="#E5E5E5"> to something that I won't</font>

1226
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:34,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to understand but I think if we</font>

1227
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:35,949
can decompose this in I would say more

1228
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:37,690
atomic projects or activities maybe we

1229
01:10:35,949 --> 01:10:40,330
can find a way of actually either

1230
01:10:37,690 --> 01:10:44,489
outsourcing that or bringing help from

1231
01:10:40,330 --> 01:10:44,489
the outside or even do that ourselves

1232
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:52,000
yeah again to repeat the only thing that

1233
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:54,969
I can commit<font color="#E5E5E5"> to now is to continue what</font>

1234
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:58,210
we're doing already where we test our

1235
01:10:54,969 --> 01:11:02,050
operation as a CA and we can redo that

1236
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:04,659
work to other see Chelsea age and and

1237
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:07,179
that we can help test or validated in a

1238
01:11:04,659 --> 01:11:11,500
framework but I cannot commit the

1239
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:15,550
setting up a a full infrastructure for

1240
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:17,320
doing this miss testing at this time if

1241
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:18,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that makes sense mother would very happy</font>

1242
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:23,650
happily work with

1243
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:32,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">X will do could you back step to the bed</font>

1244
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:37,179
bed bed bed bed yep um can um<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and</font>

1245
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:40,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aaron and lack Nick who I think are all</font>

1246
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:45,430
three here probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> ap nick is here too</font>

1247
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:50,470
I think um yeah then<font color="#CCCCCC"> AfriNIC here hey</font>

1248
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:54,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">Daniel could you you have to all of you</font>

1249
01:11:50,470 --> 01:12:01,200
have I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe test instances am I</font>

1250
01:11:54,520 --> 01:12:05,490
correct in that test in CA instances so

1251
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:10,840
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we as a group commit to building a</font>

1252
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:15,929
complex mess of CA infrastructure that

1253
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:22,180
stays and Rob and I are I'm Jay<font color="#CCCCCC"> etc etc</font>

1254
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:24,610
then maybe even<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris to having a second</font>

1255
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:26,920
level infrastructure below it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

1256
01:12:24,610 --> 01:12:31,360
forth that stays up that we can keep

1257
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:34,810
beating on and that continues to test as

1258
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:43,450
we do new versions so that we have

1259
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:48,520
regression testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay a hoodie oh</font>

1260
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:51,010
again yes I was stepping up exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1261
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:54,850
the question for clarification whether

1262
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:59,640
your test plan was for test environments

1263
01:12:54,850 --> 01:13:03,700
or for the actual production thing and

1264
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:09,010
at least at least for getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> started in</font>

1265
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:15,820
the early years i think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the test</font>

1266
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:19,000
instances should be used and yes the

1267
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:27,480
commitment safe from ripe<font color="#E5E5E5"> ncc to have</font>

1268
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:27,480
the test instance i think is unwavering

1269
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:36,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">and and I i would i would hope so that</font>

1270
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:42,940
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> others that the other rirs actually</font>

1271
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:46,030
do the same mark hosters<font color="#CCCCCC"> aaron we do</font>

1272
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:48,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a 0 te environment setup with all</font>

1273
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:50,710
our tools that's replicates what we do

1274
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:54,160
in production and encourage those who

1275
01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:58,660
want to test to use that environment to

1276
01:13:54,160 --> 01:14:01,240
those who are testing have to deal have

1277
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:05,800
to satisfy all the legal and

1278
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:07,870
requirements etc now thank you not not

1279
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:16,450
in a test environment of course like

1280
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:18,130
just over budget missed what I also on a

1281
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:21,580
budget missed what I also would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1282
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:27,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">see if there are tests instances of</font>

1283
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:32,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">caches that they also have open ports</font>

1284
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:36,480
for the 68 10 bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven or at least for</font>

1285
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:38,980
the Opera up there are open or DP caches

1286
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:40,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay yeah then let's talk later because</font>

1287
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:43,570
especially for the routing

1288
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:51,099
implementation that's what I'm very much

1289
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:55,170
interested in to run against um yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1290
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:58,420
we have a test environment it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh well</font>

1291
01:14:55,170 --> 01:15:01,060
it tends to be up to 24 7 but there's

1292
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:05,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a 24-7 services such suggests</font>

1293
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:07,930
environm me but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we need to talk</font>

1294
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:11,080
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> it godowns part of the test so</font>

1295
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:13,810
it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of them yes and one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1296
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:15,580
things there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I mean it uses the</font>

1297
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:17,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">same mechanisms as our normal</font>

1298
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:20,170
environment in that have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ripened</font>

1299
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:22,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see member to use it etc so I think</font>

1300
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:24,490
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk offline about how we can</font>

1301
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:28,840
what we can do here if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

1302
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:31,000
member etc so I i would suggest we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

1303
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:34,180
later but we do have a test environment

1304
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,950
and I I see value in using that and

1305
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:38,230
figuring out<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's anything in the</font>

1306
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:41,519
in the provisioning protocol that that

1307
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:45,669
is broken of course

1308
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:47,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">um Tom house and open it we have a test</font>

1309
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:49,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">but at the moment it's publicly</font>

1310
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:53,730
available so we should be able to do

1311
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,730
some workarounds in that time frame

1312
01:15:55,050 --> 01:16:02,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">Daniel Shaw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AfriNIC our current test bed</font>

1313
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:05,050
is not public right now however we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1314
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:07,750
one internally so if there was a request

1315
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:11,850
for someone that wanted a test bed I

1316
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:14,260
don't see an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue in opening it up I</font>

1317
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:17,680
think from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the operator point of view</font>

1318
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:21,400
it's important that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we</font>

1319
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:24,760
interoperate with all our IRS yeah

1320
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:26,799
absolutely an Alec oh I Drive and I

1321
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:31,260
think that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> support this work and don't</font>

1322
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:31,260
have resources to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do anything myself I</font>

1323
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:41,370
tied you from Japanese we have three

1324
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:46,480
types of tests bit and one is public so

1325
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:50,830
we mean zip in Japanese we have

1326
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:52,870
monitoring system for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> validation for</font>

1327
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:58,420
all objects published by Joe Panik

1328
01:16:52,870 --> 01:17:01,990
system but if you have such test

1329
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:06,840
environment for all object issued by our

1330
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:15,150
hearts or subordinate<font color="#E5E5E5"> FCA under RL is</font>

1331
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:18,550
good to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the I would say that the</font>

1332
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:23,920
number of validated roles in the world I

1333
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:28,300
think yeah in the AP Nick region we

1334
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:31,570
inflict ourselves with a subsidiary

1335
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:35,520
national registries so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would</font>

1336
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:40,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">be interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you you foo and and</font>

1337
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:44,490
Taiji would set up national registries

1338
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:48,299
under a panic so that we're actually

1339
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:51,849
playing in a test bed that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is real</font>

1340
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:54,020
useful from scenic we already have a

1341
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:57,470
testing pad in our

1342
01:17:54,020 --> 01:18:00,830
on them so but this testing that is not

1343
01:17:57,470 --> 01:18:03,980
