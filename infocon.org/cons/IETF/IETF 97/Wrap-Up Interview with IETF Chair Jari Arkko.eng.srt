things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you thought were interesting</font>

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,510
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> iguess the two most interesting</font>

20
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,269
topics that you know people seem to

21
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,218
gravitate towards was almost a the new

22
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:57,699
transport protocol quick which is

23
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:59,319
basically replacing TLS and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font>

24
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:01,388
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interest on that and that has</font>

25
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:03,489
already had a big impact on the internet

26
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:05,830
then we'll be having a big impact so

27
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:07,960
obviously we can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> working hard on that</font>

28
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:10,060
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually going to have a number of</font>

29
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,119
entering meetings and and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

30
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,770
traffic on the mini list already so that

31
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,320
that's the one to follow the other thing

32
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:19,630
that we were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about was the</font>

33
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,479
recent<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on service attacks against</font>

34
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:25,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS systems and partially caused by</font>

35
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,860
various kinds of IOT devices that were

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,140
compromised and and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was another</font>

37
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,780
very interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic for for the week</font>

38
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,460
yeah now we also had a hackathon we had

39
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,170
a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of running code happening</font>

40
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,780
what was what we thoughts on<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that</font>

41
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:40,509
well that went<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think very nicely as</font>

42
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:43,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">well and and and they were interesting</font>

43
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:45,430
topics this time<font color="#CCCCCC"> as also in the previous</font>

44
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:47,890
ones that the one outstanding thing this

45
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,479
time I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> was that we had two groups</font>

46
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,929
with lots of students so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

47
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:54,908
local university attending working on my

48
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:56,649
ATF related topics but but their

49
00:01:54,909 --> 00:02:00,249
students were here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and and working</font>

50
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:02,289
hard on implementing their feature we

51
00:02:00,249 --> 00:02:04,570
also had one<font color="#E5E5E5"> University from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Belgium</font>

52
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:06,729
where there was a small team here but

53
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:09,459
then 20 people back home in Belgium and

54
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:11,530
but still<font color="#E5E5E5"> working hard on their</font>

55
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,920
implementation that was kind of cool we

56
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:17,080
also had one open source organization

57
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,530
the OPN FB meet just before they are

58
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:23,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">atf on the previous week do their</font>

59
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,240
first-ever ACN meet up so that that was

60
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,830
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting as well and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font>

61
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,020
to work together with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the open</font>

62
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,630
source world so that's good for for them

63
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,670
and good for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we're all done here</font>

64
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,260
people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> heading out will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heading</font>
