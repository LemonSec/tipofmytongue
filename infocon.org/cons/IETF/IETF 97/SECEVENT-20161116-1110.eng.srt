00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:14,980
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said first ever meeting then we're</font>

20
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:20,140
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have presentations about risk</font>

open ID connects log out and the

22
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:26,140
proposed draft and the proposed drops

23
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:33,299
and if we have time open mic somehow I

24
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:36,730
doubt<font color="#CCCCCC"> that any agenda bashing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nope wait</font>

25
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:39,370
so as I said welcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first ever</font>

28
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,970
but then a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them came up in the</font>

29
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">yokohama meeting and the mailing list</font>

30
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:52,630
was formed there was a sort of buff at

31
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,730
the skim session in 90 f 95 that's bonus

32
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:59,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">eros there were similarly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> draft some</font>

33
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:02,798
discussion of skim use cases and finally

34
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:06,269
just under a month ago we formed<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

35
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:06,269
working group and we have our charter

36
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:14,738
the next milestone on our<font color="#CCCCCC"> charter is in</font>

37
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,989
February of 2017 to adopt draft so we're

38
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:18,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to see candidate going to get</font>

the idea events and discussion for a

52
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,780
standing to when we started adopting

53
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,780
skin off and there are two proposed

54
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:15,370
drafts how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the room I've</font>

55
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:20,910
actually read the<font color="#E5E5E5"> drafts not including</font>

56
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:25,690
those who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are true Lord Carlton okay</font>

57
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:28,300
just so that were same page how many

58
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:32,530
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with jock JW t or c</font>

59
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:39,840

60
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:44,109
skin okay that's that's good enough okay

61
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:46,919
so onto the presentations and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

62
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:58,300
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> correctly the first one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

63
00:04:46,919 --> 00:05:00,880
risk you get the slides up yeah

64
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,229
extending the pink box and go ahead

65
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to flip all right so I'm</font>

66
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:07,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to present one of the use cases</font>

67
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:10,360
for security events the one that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

68
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:16,630
more a lot about it's the we call it

69
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:19,210
risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> so risk stands for risk an incident</font>

70
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:22,060
sharing and coordination so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

71
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:28,090
want to share information about security

72
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:32,200
events in order to prevent hijacked

73
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:33,849
accounts even spreading from one party

74
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:41,050
to another in a federated environment

75
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:42,700
that's the high high level use case so

76
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">the what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the main problem we are</font>

77
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,770
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve with risk accounts are</font>

78
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,260
interconnected so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Federation it's the</font>

79
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:54,280
obvious use case we have identity

80
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:56,979
providers relying parties and there are

81
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,080
also counts are connected implicitly to

82
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:02,210
recovery options the most obvious one is

83
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:05,219
the email recovery option

84
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:08,190
so if the email<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider is compromised</font>

85
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:11,280
is probably most people understand the

86
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:13,320
use case but others sites or relying

87
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,760
parties that use that email will also be

88
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,330
compromised through the password

89
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,920
recovery<font color="#CCCCCC"> for similar things and it's not</font>

90
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">only email it can phone number is</font>

91
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,020
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> example but the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most common one</font>

92
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's email that we talked about and as I</font>

93
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,210
mentioned if an account<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets one-on-one</font>

94
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:33,060
service that quickly leads to that

95
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:36,150
account being<font color="#E5E5E5"> owned on all others or</font>

96
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,610
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> services as well so in Federation</font>

97
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:41,820
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> main issue we are facing is the fact</font>

98
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,990
that relying party sessions once the

99
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,700
user is logged in those sessions

100
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:52,290
themselves are disconnected from what

101
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:55,729
happens at the identity provider so in

102
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:58,830
risk we discuss<font color="#CCCCCC"> about two large group of</font>

103
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:01,620
events one of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's account status</font>

104
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,659
changes and here is a list of events

105
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,780
that we have been discussing and looking

106
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:10,190
at from account being suspended because

107
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,630
of suspected hijacking or abuse<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

108
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:15,630
explicit suspended by the owner<font color="#E5E5E5"> poor by</font>

109
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:17,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">the provider once the account is</font>

110
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,560
recovered then we have reactivated

111
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,809
accounts again<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is distinction and</font>

112
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,370
then accounts can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> deleted and there</font>

113
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,560
is distinction for many of these events

114
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:28,980
between owner and provider depending on

115
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:32,520
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the situation is the provider can</font>

116
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:34,050
be in a consumer case and owner it's an

117
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,260
enterprise case when the enterprise

118
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:39,660
administrator explicitly does one of

119
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">these actions on the account and the</font>

120
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,490
other one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the reissued accounts</font>

121
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,989
that's when the an account is recycled

122
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:51,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the same identifier is used for a</font>

123
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:54,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">different person the other group of</font>

125
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,000
example password changes on the account

126
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,980
for some reason if the older sessions

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,640
are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> identity provider are evoked for</font>

128
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:07,560
the user recovery options change like

129
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,860
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> recover your phone recovery</font>

130
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,110
change public<font color="#CCCCCC"> identifiers change maybz</font>

131
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,750
in some cases users change their email

132
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,520
address and many relying parties

133
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:21,150
use that in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> abuse as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the main key</font>

134
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,060
made identifier fact second factor added

135
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:27,919
or removed or grants or<font color="#E5E5E5"> grants or other</font>

136
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,920
kind of grants<font color="#E5E5E5"> or tokens being revoked</font>

137
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,780
so I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to highlight and in</font>

138
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,419
general for security events in

139
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:38,880
particular for risk that the recipient

140
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:41,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these events it's always the users</font>

141
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:45,420
application whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> application means</font>

142
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:50,100
so if it's in Federation<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases based</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

143
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:52,079
ought to its the target of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client or</font>

144
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,120
the relying party that the auto grant

145
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,250

recipient for events related to that

147
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:02,040
user and then when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the</font>

148
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,350
implicit use case where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> the flow it's</font>

149

based on a recovery information again

150
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,540
it's events<font color="#CCCCCC"> are targeted only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:17,489

option or uses that recovery option one

153
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:25,710
of the tricky issues with with risk

154
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:28,230
events<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how to it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rerun it is around</font>

155
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:31,589
privacy basically how do you keep the

156
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:33,990
user how do you notify the user in a way

157
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:35,940
that user understands what's happening

158
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:39,000
how hard it<font color="#E5E5E5"> transparent to the user and</font>

159
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:42,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other one should you or how are you</font>

160
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,650
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give some options to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the user</font>

161
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:49,320
the obvious point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that ok the user</font>

162
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:51,030
should have the option to opt out but

163
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,100
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what an attacker would do in the</font>

164
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:56,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">first place so it's a it's a delicate</font>

165
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,620
situation and the the more delicate one

166
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,810
is how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain all these events</font>

167
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you are sharing to the user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

168
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,349
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> meaningful way so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still a</font>

169
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,839
work in progress I don't think we have a

170
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:13,350
good solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that but we're yeah</font>

171
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:15,780
that's that's still up just a few notes

172
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:19,140
about an<font color="#E5E5E5"> early implementation we we have</font>

173
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:21,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">at Google so we are started publishing</font>

174
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,279
to type of events sessions revoked and

175
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,470
tokens revolt

176
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,139
so sessions evoked happens when the user

177
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:31,290
changes the password or explicitly<font color="#E5E5E5"> logs</font>

178
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:33,029
out for example so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just not if we</font>

179
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,279
can notify<font color="#E5E5E5"> third party simply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by the</font>

180
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:36,930
fact that all the Google closed all the

<font color="#E5E5E5">sessions for the user and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual</font>

182
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:42,170
reason it's not shared and tokens

00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:44,850
revoked it shared with<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-parties</font>

184
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:47,459

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case the event is shared only</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and in near future we are working on</font>

more abuse related events when accounts

are locked and recovered and currently

191
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,410
we are using because we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

as soon as we agree on the

mentioned meaningful user experience how

00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,699
do you involve how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you keep the user</font>

in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> loop that's that's a very tricky</font>

and abuse to make the clear distinction

206
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:44,100
between hijacking and abuse should we

207
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:45,930
make the distinction so that's a lot of

00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">privacy is involved in this issue and</font>

try to not to disclose too much details

communicated to relying parties is still

214
00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:03,540
not decided the implicit use case it's

215
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:05,250
when the recovery option it's used so

216
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:09,449
the user doesn't have explicit

217
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:11,160
relationship between<font color="#CCCCCC"> erp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the IDP so</font>

218
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:13,410
we need to solve that use case so we'll

219
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,990
probably need some registration flow

220
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:18,809
where the relying party explicitly makes

221
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,579
an API call back to the IDP saying hey I

222
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:22,620
have a new registration which is email

223
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:25,170
address i would like to receive<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure</font>

224

225
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,829
plan for that

226
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:33,260
the we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are working on standardizing</font>

227
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,880
distribution and the sooner we get to a

228
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:38,060
standard the better so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can start</font>

229
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,070
implementing as usual a big problem is

230
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:45,399
getting critical mass enough players we

231
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:47,930
can start exchanging these messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

232
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,760
while many things really high level we

233
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:52,279
do have understanding how<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moving a</font>

234
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,529
standard we still haven't talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

235
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:57,529
how to standardize each event in

236
00:12:54,529 --> 00:13:00,200
particular what attributes to exchange

237
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:02,180
what you are eyes to use for events it's

238
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,180
a relatively easy problem but still

239
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:08,149
that's one step<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we it's one problem</font>

240
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:17,120
we haven't sold it and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

242
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:25,459
thank you so next up is like turned with

open ID<font color="#CCCCCC"> connected out let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me just get</font>

244

the slides up hello I'm Mike Jones from

245
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:48,768
Microsoft and I'm going to briefly

246
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,779
overview a use case where the open ID

247
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:54,860
connect working group decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font>

248
00:13:50,779 --> 00:14:01,820
draft identity event for matter the

249
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:04,970
security event format<font color="#E5E5E5"> no next so the</font>

250
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:10,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem that we're solving is having a</font>

251
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:13,820
way to securely have an identity

252
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:17,750
provider notify a relying party that

253
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:21,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's to log out a particular user in</font>

254
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:23,600
session for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the identity at that</font>

255
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:27,079
identity provider and it's called back

256
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,790
channel because it's sent directly

257
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:31,459
server to server rather than

258
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:34,370
communicated through a front channel

259
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:38,529
browser redirect channel like many kinds

260
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,529
of log outs next

261
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:46,140
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way this works is a message is</font>

262
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:49,199
sent<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a defined end point at the</font>

263
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:53,699
relying party that supports<font color="#E5E5E5"> back-channel</font>

264
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:56,940
logout it's sent as an HTTP post and the

265
00:14:53,700 --> 00:15:03,380
format of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the message is a jot which</font>

266
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:06,240
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> to also be a security event next</font>

267
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:09,510
the claims in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> jot should be</font>

268
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,930
unsurprising to those familiar with ID

269
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:16,019
tokens you have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a subject to</font>

270
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:18,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">an audience issued at a unique</font>

271
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:22,560
identifier<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the new claim</font>

272
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:25,589
defined by the draft today which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

273
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,630
events claim which uses a particular

274
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:38,750
value<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say this is a back-channel log</font>

275
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:42,089
at message next so that's an example

276
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:51,329
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft of what the claims in</font>

277
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:55,790
such a security event look like next so

278
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:55,790
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take away from this use case</font>

279
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:02,279
this events very simple it doesn't use

280
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,519
any event specific payload data it just

281
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:10,050
has an event identify or being that you

282
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:12,990
are I that's defined it just uses the

283
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:17,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">normal top-level jot claims to identify</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> subject of the event the events</font>

285
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:23,730
claim is used for the spec to identify

286
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:29,399
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a logout event this does</font>

287
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:33,360
not use<font color="#E5E5E5"> a special transport such as the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">event transport being defined in the</font>

289
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:43,140
other draft it's just an HTTP message

290
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:45,390
next so final thoughts the security

291
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,550
event format is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just like</font>

292
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:50,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">jot was very simple</font>

293
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:52,199
uh it seems to work well for this use

294
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:55,279
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's going to work well for</font>

295
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:58,399
some of the other use cases such as the

296
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:02,010
security events that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just described</font>

297
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:05,760
I think being simple it's likely to get

298
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:09,329
adopted just like jot appears to be so

299
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,429
I'm happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this and you know there</font>

300
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:13,770
may be other formats to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find for other</font>

301
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:17,839
things but that's outside the scope of

302
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,839
what I'm talking about any questions

303
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:29,400
just a richer just one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

304
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,900
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be a sort of an</font>

305
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,070
ongoing discussion in this group<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

306
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,990
know you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have talked about a mic</font>

307
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:37,050
and that's the the placement of the

308
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:39,900
issue or<font color="#E5E5E5"> in subject inside all of these</font>

309
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:42,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">various tokens now for the case of a log</font>

310
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,550
out like this the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> or in subject</font>

311
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,710
pairing of an open ID<font color="#CCCCCC"> connects identity</font>

312
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:48,830
it does make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's the IDP</font>

313
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:52,740
that's generating this log out message

314
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:54,389
but I i would say personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

315
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,260
that we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very careful to</font>

316
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:59,640
classify that as a very specific

317
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,230
optimization for a very specific use

318
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,210
case because in other circumstances

319
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,740
we're going to have messages from either

320
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,540
are peas or third-party logging

321
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:10,080
providers or something like that where

322
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:12,450
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> subject is not actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

323
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,610
namespace of the issuer of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

324
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,929
event it's in somebody else's name space

325
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:19,590
so there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be another level of</font>

326
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:21,600
issuers and I'm very afraid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

327
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,428
getting those<font color="#CCCCCC"> things mixed up with each</font>

328
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,070
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> and making them look like messages</font>

329
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:27,960
that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so I just want to raise</font>

330
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:30,360
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think we have time to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

331
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,030
know debate that here but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

332
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,350
raise<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as an issue to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the group and</font>

333
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,059
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have to decide what we</font>

334
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,280
want to do with this not sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

335
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:42,149
acknowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay actually quite ahead of</font>

336
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:46,410
time so you have time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just know trust</font>

337
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:48,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">me no I just I acknowledge that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

338
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,820
certainly going to be events with more

339
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:53,700
complicated relationships that have to

340
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:57,210
be expressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the data structure this</font>

341
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:59,850
was a simple bilateral and it works well

342
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,570
already according to people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who looked</font>

343
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,668
at it

344
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:05,879
but yes there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated</font>

345
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:13,340
events with different representations

346
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:13,340
and the spectrum allows that thank you

347
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:31,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay which leaves us with Phil and Tony</font>

348
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:34,049
I was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to yield the first part on</font>

349
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:38,580
skim to Tony for a few minutes to talk

350
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:42,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">about skim events Microsoft's been doing</font>

351
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:48,139
some thinking there yeah so skin is

352
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:51,529
great for a master directory situation

353
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:55,408
skim does not work well for multi master

354
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:59,940
directory synchronizations and so we've

355
00:19:55,409 --> 00:20:01,980
been exploring using a way to do

356
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:07,139
directory synchronization with events

357
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:09,870
and feeds and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we've got some</font>

358
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:12,629
prototypes working and stuff of how we

359
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:15,209
wind up using the ID events to allow

360
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:18,000
multi directory synchronization to go on

361
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,799
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they put out the events into</font>

362
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,659
feeds and you can pull from the feeds

363
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:23,580
and and take it from there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

364
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:25,529
pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know pick the events that you</font>

365
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to be interested in or you want to</font>

366
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:30,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">apply to your to your directory and so</font>

367
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:33,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably some work that may have</font>

368
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:35,940
been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be done in skin but now</font>

369
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,830
skin is shut down you know we looked for

370
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:42,179
another way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do this in this</font>

371
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:48,059
one actually works<font color="#E5E5E5"> very well we do not</font>

372
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:50,009
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's one thing</font>

373
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:53,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we would definitely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to see</font>

374
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:57,990
changed is right now the specs actually

375
00:20:53,789 --> 00:21:01,919
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you wind up using the the JWT</font>

376
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:06,149
and we're not using that we have other

377
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:08,279
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we put into the as far as</font>

378
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:11,729
events different formats of events and

379
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:13,929
JWT's don't actually fit this particular

380
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,639
case so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know relax</font>

381
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:18,700
sation of what actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes in there</font>

382
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:25,149
may may help us you know get some things

383
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:26,499
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks Tony and the skin</font>

384
00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:29,768
working group had been talking about

385
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:31,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">some cases</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for many years some of them</font>

386
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:33,690
are high-level events which you'll see

387
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:37,570
repeated in what<font color="#CCCCCC"> marius said in the risk</font>

388
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:40,539
working group skim had said well if from

389
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:43,240
a provisioning perspective a password

390
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:46,389
was reset or an account was locked we

391
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,679
had a similar set of events so one of

392
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:51,668
the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll be thinking</font>

393
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:54,700
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> going forward is do we have some</font>

394
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:56,529
reconciliation of events or is what the

395
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,990
skin working group if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to</font>

396
00:21:56,529 --> 00:22:00,429
assert a separate set of events and risk

397
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,559
working group sets it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> even though</font>

398
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:06,369
there's overlapping is that a bad

399
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:08,529
problem for me on the set side of things

400
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:10,990
I'm looking at it going are there is

401
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:13,629
that mean an issue in common does that

402
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,779
mean some advice that we can lay out on

403
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:18,129
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> course back that helps these other</font>

404
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:21,249
working groups decide what they want to

405
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:24,730
do if it hasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been said I think one of</font>

406
00:22:21,249 --> 00:22:27,429
the when<font color="#CCCCCC"> when this work started it was</font>

407
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:29,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I noticed that all these working</font>

408
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,029
groups were working on a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar</font>

409
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:33,668
problem and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> book</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jays maybe we</font>

410
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:35,259
could use<font color="#E5E5E5"> jots and bring them all</font>

411
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:37,440
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least have common</font>

412
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:39,970
libraries some common interoperability

413
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,889
the question is how much is in common

414
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">and how much independence so I talk I'll</font>

415
00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:46,689
use terminology like profiling<font color="#CCCCCC"> spec</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

416
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:48,519
what I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a spec like the risk</font>

417
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:51,159
working group would write their spec

418
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:54,909
they define an event for risk that

419
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:56,980
leverages the set token spec so they get

420
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:59,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the specifics of what their events</font>

421
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,869
mean so a lot of times when we're

422
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:04,269
talking about set<font color="#E5E5E5"> its the coursepack</font>

423
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:06,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that everybody's building off of it</font>

424
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:09,429
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily have real events</font>

425
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:11,259
right now editorially one of the

426
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:13,600
challenges you'll see in the document is

427
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:16,119
a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of made-up events those aren't</font>

428
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,519
actually real events or just what they

429
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:23,740
might look like if those groups went

430
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:27,430
forward so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's go ahead so there are</font>

431
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,870
two drafts one is slightly

432
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">our mature than the other you'll see the</font>

433
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:37,389
set token has gone through six revisions

434
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:39,280
and it's a profile itself of RFC 7519 we

435
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:42,370
have a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're still</font>

436
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,870
talking about some good ideas to

437
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:48,129
optimize and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll mention that on a</font>

438
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:52,929
later slide distribution is only at

439
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:54,580
revision<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 and we are still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

440
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:58,120
sort out what are the real distribution

441
00:23:54,580 --> 00:24:00,340
problems and even harder is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

442
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:03,159
manage the pub sub<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationship so we've</font>

443
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:05,560
we've kind of defined two issues in

444
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">distribution it may cause us to split</font>

445
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">this draft up into two separate specs</font>

446
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:14,350
when is the control plane how do I

447
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:15,820
manage as the subscriber how do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

448
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:18,520
the publisher i'm interested in its

449
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">series of events how do i exchange all</font>

450
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,139
the configuration keys<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want a signed</font>

451
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,730
event here's my public key or want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

452
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,260
encrypt event here's my public key so

453
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,890
you can encrypt the event what's your

454
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:33,670
public key so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can validate that</font>

455
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:35,590
that it was sent by you if the endpoints

456
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:38,200
are protected by<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 auth we have to have</font>

457
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:40,439
some management<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tokens and all of</font>

458
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so there's a fair amount of</font>

459
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,400
logistics to just get these connections

460
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:48,130
working securely so the control plane

461
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,410
allows a client or even a publisher

462
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:53,050
administrator to manage those

463
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:56,110
subscriptions and also check<font color="#CCCCCC"> the status</font>

464
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:58,060
of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> subscription if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've subscribed to</font>

465
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:59,709
google to get a bunch of events and I'm

466
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,629
kind of normally getting a thousand

467
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:03,370
events an hour and I not gotten anything

468
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:05,040
for the last couple hours is it because

469
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:07,179
there's been no events or is because

470
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,639
there's a failure condition because a

471
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,770
key rollover occurred and guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

472
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,890
we're not configured correctly so

473
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:17,800
there's some sort of DevOps anticipation

474
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:22,510
requirements in the control plane and

475
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:23,980
the data plane is really what we most

476
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:27,040
often think about is how do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> deliver</font>

477
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:31,320
the event so the draft right now

478
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:36,250
specifies a simple HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> POST over TLS</font>

479
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:39,418
the only thing that is complex about is

480
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:41,440
that we require the receiver before

481
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:44,080
acknowledging receipt by sending it back

482
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,600
an accepted response it should at least

483
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,939
check that the event was valid so that

484
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:52,120
the publisher can assume the event was

485
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,440
delivered it was just a if it's just a

486
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,129
post and they get an accepted

487
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,440
immediately and the subscriber wasn't

488
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:01,450
able to parse it or wasn't able to sort

489
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got gobbledygook we wanted to</font>

490
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:07,240
actually say I couldn't parse the event

491
00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:11,169
so that's as complex as we want to make

492
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:15,030
that that profiles there there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

493
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:18,520
discussion about other modes of delivery

494
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:24,399
through secure messaging from mobile

495
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:29,500
apps HTTP HTTP to web push there are

496
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:32,950
other models and from there I kind of

497
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:35,770
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay no problem let's not get crazy</font>

498
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:37,570
but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you do it we should make</font>

499
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:39,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you go through some criteria for why</font>

500
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,379
you're doing it what are the security

501
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:43,629
issues you should consider and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

502
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:48,340
a client understand how you choose to

503
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:51,789
distribute that event ideally we'd like

504
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:55,570
to keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple to one method but that</font>

505
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:59,559
might not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> real Kathleen so now I see</font>

506
00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:01,059
why you had some of the other why you

507
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:05,020
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different transport listed on your</font>

508
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:07,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">your notes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that one meets</font>

509
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:11,168
your needs a taxi 1 i'm wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

510
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:13,990
haven't looked at a draft untidy event

511
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:15,429
distribution but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm also wondering you</font>

512
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:18,309
know we're in<font color="#CCCCCC"> an early stage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's</font>

513
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:21,700
compare what options are there in mile

514
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:24,580
there's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> XMPP grid draft that has</font>

515
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:27,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">pub/sub capabilities it's in use by at</font>

516
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:29,830
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 vendors now I I don't know the</font>

517
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:33,460
current<font color="#E5E5E5"> number but the author is like</font>

518
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:37,720
right right<font color="#E5E5E5"> here um what was that cold</font>

519
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:40,419
sorry xmpp grid<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I was worried</font>

520
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:44,110
about that it I mean it does what's

521
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:48,909
described here it's been deployed<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

522
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:50,979
more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 vendors if I think it</font>

523
00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:52,690
efficiently meets the goals you've

524
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,110
described so far but maybe I'll learn

525
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:56,620
more

526
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:59,889
series does that add the bidirectional

527
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:02,020
capability then given its<font color="#CCCCCC"> XMPP yeah yeah</font>

528
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:04,270
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would sound very I was</font>

529
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:06,240
wondering about that because risks the

530
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:08,920
risk communities been talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

531
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,450
bidirectional bilateral relationship

532
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,100
with the pub sub and we were saying

533
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,929
would that be two separate subscriptions

534
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,178
going each way or would it be a

535
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:17,860
bilateral communication haha yeah not

536
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:20,380
only that but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> can support all</font>

537
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:22,990
different data formats for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know</font>

538
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:25,179
what you're exchanging so that's X and

539
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:28,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">PB grid XMPP can do that anyway right</font>

540
00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:30,940
yeah putting Nancy on the spot but I

541
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:33,760
know I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean it's</font>

542
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:35,830
it's sort of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the first meeting</font>

543
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:41,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we want to gather what are all the</font>

544
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:43,240
issues and what can we reuse and get

545
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:46,600
effective I mean the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that's</font>

546
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,429
driving us is move quickly people want

547
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:52,090
to implement stuff now go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

548
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:54,580
yeah so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the easy just to answer</font>

549
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:56,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the questions and we can take it</font>

550
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:59,889
offline because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure it'll be longer</font>

551
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:02,410
so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is bilateral pneus there's the</font>

552
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:05,799
question of from this control plane and

553
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:10,260
security aspects um we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clarify</font>

554
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:13,720
on what that bilateral nest means um

555
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:16,240
typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whether it's XMPP or the</font>

556
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:19,299
other ones whether it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> amqp and you</font>

557
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:25,390
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> queues vs XMPP it talks about</font>

558
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:28,299
topics right it's usually you have some

559
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:32,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">entities sharing that particular context</font>

560
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:33,970
q or topic so anyway just need to get

561
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,929
clarity and what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean by the</font>

562
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:40,299
bilateral us but but it should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

563
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:43,450
flexibility on the defining the types of

564
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:46,540
tokens yeah a check um one example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

565
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:49,330
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike sort of example didn't</font>

566
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:51,610
complete it but one simple example is an

567
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:54,370
identity provider at an open ID provider

568
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:58,000
issuing a logout token to the relying

569
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:59,290
party website is one direction<font color="#E5E5E5"> but often</font>

570
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,840
people have cases saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

571
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:04,480
initiate the login at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> retail site</font>

572
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,779
and we want to let the opie know so in

573
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,779
effect

574
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:11,239
the initiation could occur at either end

575
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:13,879
and then risk sort of talks about same

576
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:16,070
thing risk events we can see risky

577
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:17,840
activity going on on the web commercial

00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:20,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">web site and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to let the IDP know</font>

579
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:23,149
there's a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I got it because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

580
00:30:20,989 --> 00:30:26,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">just remembered that working a blast</font>

581
00:30:23,149 --> 00:30:28,399
call will start on that draft soon so if

582
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:30,879
people from this group want to just<font color="#CCCCCC"> jump</font>

583
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:33,139
on the my list with some reviews of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

584
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:35,178
that would be really helpful just to

585
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:37,699
make sure if you do go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it</font>

586
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:45,649
that you caught anything you needed to

587
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:53,029
catch thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kathleen Moriarty ad the</font>

588
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:57,018
next slide so Mike actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> did a good</font>

589
00:30:53,029 --> 00:31:02,330
job of highlighting all these we're just

590
00:30:57,019 --> 00:31:05,690
reusing all the job attributes there are

591
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:09,639
some things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort out about things</font>

592
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:12,589
like issued at there can be cases where

593
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:14,508
the time at which the event is published

594
00:31:12,589 --> 00:31:16,658
is not necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time the event</font>

595
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:19,729
actually occurred so we may need

596
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:21,859
language<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that andie nash a couple of</font>

597
00:31:19,729 --> 00:31:24,200
weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago brought up a case that they do</font>

598
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:26,570
some analysis and discover a week later

599
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,279
there was a problem in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the expected</font>

600
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:31,099
occurrence of the event<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks like a</font>

00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:33,639
week<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'm issuing the report now</font>

602
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:36,408
so right now we only<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attribute</font>

603
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:37,699
there can also be<font color="#CCCCCC"> Delta differences just</font>

604
00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:40,519
simply because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a distributed</font>

605
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:43,249
architecture the component that detected

606
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:45,139
the state change or the issue it's not

607
00:31:43,249 --> 00:31:47,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily the one that published the</font>

608
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:51,349
event to its subscriber and there might

609
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:55,339
be a minute lag even so we have to sort

610
00:31:51,349 --> 00:31:56,718
that out the events was the attribute

611
00:31:55,339 --> 00:31:58,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mike already mentioned that's how you</font>

612
00:31:56,719 --> 00:32:02,080
indicate what type of event is being

613
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:04,820
there it also might give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hint as to</font>

614
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,129
what amount of payload is there Justin's

615
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,928
made a proposal to the change the way

616
00:32:07,129 --> 00:32:14,779
the draft is written that makes it even

617
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:16,399
simpler transaction we<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice that there</font>

618
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:18,960
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of cases where we might</font>

619
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:21,479
express the same event in

620
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,299
two or three<font color="#E5E5E5"> different ways because the</font>

621
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,010
subscriber for example might not

622
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:28,710
understand what suspicious activity

623
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:30,270
means and mary has brought up the case a

624
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of times they just say look cancel</font>

625
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:34,049
the sessions just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry about the</font>

626
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:35,908
reason why since you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't understand</font>

627
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:37,860
the reasons why and can't consume that

628
00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:41,100
will just send you a a session

629
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:43,260
revocation there are cases then when you

630
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,770
want to go back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we're all these</font>

631
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:48,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">events actually stemming from the same</font>

632
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:51,658
occurrence<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if I shoot three different</font>

633
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:53,899
representations of an event transaction

634
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:57,480
could be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say this was actually</font>

635
00:32:53,899 --> 00:33:00,870
stemming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing even though</font>

636
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:05,270
it's expressed multiple ways the event

637
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:08,520
objects the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier which was</font>

638
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:12,029
if I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass an issuer for the</font>

639
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:14,299
subject as opposed to the issuer for the

640
00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:16,860
event you would use a payload for that

641
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:18,629
you might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> just other data like in</font>

642
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,908
password<font color="#E5E5E5"> resets you might be keeping</font>

643
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:23,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">track of how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times is the user</font>

644
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:26,640
reset the account as additional data so

645
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:29,039
in a lot of cases the event type the

646
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,440
subject sends you a lot of information

647
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:33,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">you don't need anything more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but the</font>

648
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,330
reality might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is now the</font>

649
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:38,158
fifth<font color="#E5E5E5"> time that this has occurred and so</font>

650
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,779
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> letting you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know so there are cases</font>

651
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:44,730
where we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send some additional</font>

652
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:46,649
data of course one of the things reasons

653
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:48,740
we wanted to reuse job is who gave us

654
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:52,770
the ability to sign and encrypt events

655
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:54,539
which gives us some flexibility maybe

656
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:55,950
it's a good thing or not a good thing

657
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:57,919
but the idea that when<font color="#CCCCCC"> people were</font>

658
00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:00,870
saying I wanted to send it out over I

659
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,360
message we knew the thing could be

660
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:08,009
self-contained and encrypted if that's

661
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:10,739
what we want to do so the requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

662
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:16,379
have a bulletproof transport were less

663
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:19,649
dependent on it there go ahead next so

664
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:22,460
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike's example of a log it but</font>

665
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:22,460
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I show</font>

666
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:31,649
sorry you probably didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear that as I</font>

667
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:33,809
walked away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the mic the separate</font>

668
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:36,839
issue where n SIDS the idea would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

669
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:40,770
that the issuer here is the issuer of

670
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:43,558
the subject up above and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the publisher</font>

671
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:46,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the event is server example calm it</font>

672
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:50,940
was not the server that issued the

673
00:34:46,069 --> 00:34:53,659
identity so the optimization we're

674
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:58,920
talking about is moving this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason</font>

675
00:34:53,659 --> 00:35:03,390
careful right the optimization can<font color="#CCCCCC"> poke</font>

676
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:06,329
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to loosen your hand yeah so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

677
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:09,868
the optimization is to take this JSON

678
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:13,549
object after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that URL and move it into</font>

679
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:16,589
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> events attribute as a sub object of</font>

680
00:35:13,549 --> 00:35:20,309
up there so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all self-contained</font>

681
00:35:16,589 --> 00:35:23,640
and then if you have no data would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

682
00:35:20,309 --> 00:35:26,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">just put null or would you put MPs race</font>

683
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:30,029
brackets we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming down to just</font>

684
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:32,520
empty brackets would be fine and it's

685
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:35,250
short and it's it's easier for faster

686
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:41,309
parsing so that's one change to the

687
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:48,569
current draw next so the delivery side

688
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:52,470
is to contain an HTTPS post some call it

689
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:55,680
a web call back we've talked about

690
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:57,720
delivering multiple messages or one so

691
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">far the testing saying don't bother with</font>

692
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,689
batching just do one at a time maintain

693
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:06,720
your connection pooling and you'll be

694
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:08,309
good all you do when we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

695
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,200
multi messages we get into a lot more

696
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:14,220
complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> signaling so we want to keep it</font>

697
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple there's there's still discussion</font>

698
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:19,259
on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that seems to be settling</font>

699
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:22,319
down based on some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the testing it as</font>

700
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,390
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned earlier HTTP status 202 is</font>

701
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:27,000
used to confirm receipt so when you

702
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:29,279
issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> that receipt what you're saying to</font>

703
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">the publisher is I got it now whether</font>

704
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,970
you actually test or not is your

705
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:35,940
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you're letting the</font>

706
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:38,250
publisher give up so that's one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

707
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,900
conditions were setting saying we're not

708
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get as sophisticated as that</font>

709
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,230
there's no

710
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:44,940
call back or act messages your if you

711
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:47,940
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the message or 18 able to</font>

712
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:51,720
parse it you should throw an error so we

713
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,520
do define a bunch of HTTP status 400

714
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:57,359
errors that are really more often than

715
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,580
not relating to jot parsing issues that

716
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,080
occur you got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong key the</font>

717
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:08,790
signature wasn't valid and things like

718
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:10,860
that next slide so in thinking about the

719
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:14,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">broader scope I'm not happy with this</font>

720
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:16,440
slide yet it was something I added late

721
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:20,279
we are trying to define what does it

722
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:23,010
mean to have a feed of events is it a

723
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:27,210
category of events I'm subscribing to

724
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:30,180
get a series of events from a publisher

725
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:32,520
and I need an endpoint to deliver them

726
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,290
to so what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the relationship to this</font>

727
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,870
is saul building towards a data model

728
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:39,480
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> control plane and how to deal</font>

729
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:41,970
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so given a hat there might be</font>

730
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,130
I've only listed for that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> make me</font>

731
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:47,279
many different events that could be

732
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:48,900
generated<font color="#E5E5E5"> different formats I could</font>

733
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,130
create feed so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the example I sort of</font>

734
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:56,040
chose was I might have an open ID

735
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:58,200
provider that wants to issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> log out</font>

736
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,910
events and how would<font color="#CCCCCC"> it group those log</font>

737
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,600
out events of interest well it might

738
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:06,240
group those by audience and the effect

739
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:08,339
of the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be that everybody</font>

740
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:13,560
within a single sign-on domain carries

741
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:16,350
the same carries the same audience so i

742
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:18,690
might have servers in hong kong servers

743
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:21,750
in china and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they both might choose to</font>

744
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:25,800
subscribe to the single sign out feed

745
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:29,790
for asia for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

746
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:35,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a many-to-one relationship between</font>

747
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:36,570
feeds and subscriptions for various

748
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,460
reasons we're also talking about

749
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:45,600
changing some of the terminology so this

750
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:46,860
is up in the air not very mature then

751
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:50,730
it's something from our earlier

752
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:54,869
discussion merius anyway

753
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:57,390
let's go on Oh risk adds another concept

754
00:38:54,869 --> 00:39:00,840
of you have a feed to find a logical

755
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:04,470
feed between two entities let's say it's

756
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:07,020
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oracle in Google when we first set</font>

757
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:08,220
that up there's no users in that feed

758
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:10,140
there's no subjects that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

759
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:13,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> across but over time through these</font>

760
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:16,049
explicit or<font color="#CCCCCC"> implicit connections Google</font>

761
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:19,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">will let us know that says this this</font>

762
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:20,730
user<font color="#E5E5E5"> Phil hunt is using our services so</font>

763
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,869
we'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to get security events about</font>

764
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,550
Phil hunt and they would they would

765
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:25,770
register and say Phil hunt is to be

766
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:27,210
added<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this feed or Phil hunt us to be</font>

767
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:31,140
removed from this feed and that would be

768
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:33,240
part of the control plane so there's the

769
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,980
notion of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the event formats</font>

770
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:37,740
you're issuing and then against what

771
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:40,500
population of subjects or resources that

772
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:54,839
those are being<font color="#E5E5E5"> generated against next</font>

773
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:56,880
slide so what's new here so we were

774
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:59,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking today that that Mayor this</font>

775
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,470
morning that<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe what I was calling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

776
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,090
subscription is really kind of a

777
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:05,700
connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> path this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is where I'm going</font>

778
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:08,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">to physically deliver a series of events</font>

779
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:12,149
to specific web<font color="#E5E5E5"> ed point over a specific</font>

780
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:16,140
protocol be at HTTP or XMPP or something

781
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:18,630
like that and how do I do that what do I

782
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:20,670
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do to correct construct the job</font>

783
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:23,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">correctly for that subscribe or all the</font>

784
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:27,240
management information that goes with it

785
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:31,709
so that's what's in the definition<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

786
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:40,589
subscription<font color="#CCCCCC"> and for any feed there can</font>

787
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:42,510
be many subscriptions next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide I put</font>

788
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:43,830
in a state diagram and it actually was

789
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:47,340
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was already working on it</font>

790
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:51,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">when Kathleen noticed you were Steve and</font>

791
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:55,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">I raised the net comp issue there's a</font>

792
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:58,380
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of parallels so while we felt we</font>

793
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:00,650
were very different in our stack we were

794
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,550
using jot and using other things I

795
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:04,020
thought there was a lot to be learned

796
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,560
from and one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had I</font>

797
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,960
thought that

798
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,460
interesting was a state diagram so you

799
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,340
can have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> subscription and that</font>

800
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:13,710
subscription can actually be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in multiple</font>

801
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,960
states it can be on it can be off it can

802
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:20,160
be failed what does it mean in each<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

803
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:22,500
those states we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a state when you</font>

804
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:25,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">create a subscription called verify and</font>

805
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,940
what that allows is for a special event

806
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:28,860
to be sent called a verification event

807
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:31,110
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply is this connection</font>

808
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:33,450
working and can they parse my events and

809
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:36,330
if the verification is good then we're

810
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:39,029
set to go I saw in some other specs it

811
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:40,680
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> also a useful way to prevent a</font>

812
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:43,410
denial of service attack where somebody

813
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,750
fraudulently wrecked reckon fraudulently

814
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:48,720
tries to set up a subscription just to

815
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:50,460
annoy someone else with a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data so</font>

816
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,410
if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint you get is actually</font>

817
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,810
doesn't know how to parse it or isn't a

818
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:56,220
real<font color="#CCCCCC"> endpoint you'd quickly know this</font>

819
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:58,980
isn't going to work and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

820
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:01,589
doing you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight to fail and it's</font>

821
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:05,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">done so that's where we're going and</font>

822
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:07,410
then operationally things change<font color="#CCCCCC"> keys</font>

823
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:09,780
rotate Connection network problems are

824
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:11,640
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist and we can anticipate</font>

825
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:15,210
that maybe after a bunch of trials to

826
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:18,000
deliver an event the publisher will flag

827
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:19,680
that has failed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so how does the</font>

828
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,510
subscriber know about it they can check

829
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,549
the control plane this game interface

830
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:28,590
and get the current current subscription

831
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:30,540
status so next slide one of the ways to

832
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:35,310
do that is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do skin get on the</font>

833
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:37,560
subscription and you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this now</font>

834
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:41,279
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that there's a</font>

835
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:44,490
subscription I have to apologize sub

836
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,640
status is wrong it would be verify or or

837
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:51,089
on or one of those pending was from an

838
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:54,270
earlier version so that's wrong but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

839
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:55,710
would actually foremost ongoing queries

840
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:57,810
when you're checking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the status of the</font>

841
00:42:55,710 --> 00:43:00,660
subscription you would be looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

842
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:03,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's on normally and then on the</font>

843
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,940
next slide if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pause it because</font>

844
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:07,410
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something with my endpoint I</font>

845
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:10,710
have to reboot<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cluster or do</font>

846
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:13,980
something I can ask the publisher to

847
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:16,980
pause the subscription next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so</font>

848
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,910
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> here the subscriber can do a simple</font>

849
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,980
put

850
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:23,160
and he changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the value of sub status</font>

851
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:26,039
to paused and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> tells the publisher</font>

852
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:28,170
to hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to events for as long as you</font>

853
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:31,170
can one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we're talking</font>

854
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:35,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">about is what's the publishers ability</font>

855
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:37,260
to store events or queue them up if it's

856
00:43:35,609 --> 00:43:39,270
a high rate of events it might be

857
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:41,369
completely unrealistic beyond a few

858
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:42,990
milliseconds other ones where it's a

859
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:45,690
hundred events a day could probably hold

860
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:47,160
it for days that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that a</font>

861
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:51,750
publisher and subscriber would have to

862
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:54,029
work out this can also be done with a

863
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:57,869
skin patch command the reason I decided

864
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:59,520
to show you put what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are</font>

865
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:03,059
lots<font color="#CCCCCC"> of libraries out there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not all the</font>

866
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:09,530
mint iment patch but put was a mandatory

867
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:11,640
requirement next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so the verify I</font>

868
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:13,920
mentioned this earlier we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

869
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,770
go on but it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pain</font>

870
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,349
command that says can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you read this</font>

871
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:22,130
thing it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually a real event so</font>

872
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:24,630
we're specifying the one standard event

873
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:26,549
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a verify event and it just</font>

874
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:32,210
simply says is the connection work and

875
00:44:26,549 --> 00:44:35,089
can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> read it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in parts it next slide</font>

876
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:37,920
there's the verification token which is

877
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:40,589
the way we confirm it was we send it

878
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,109
some unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier and if they can</font>

879
00:44:40,589 --> 00:44:45,119
return it back to us in the response

880
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:47,058
that confirms to the publisher that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

881
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:52,859
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to actually parse the event</font>

882
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:56,520
and that's actually the only time we

883
00:44:52,859 --> 00:45:05,420
respond in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the HTTP POST delivery method</font>

884
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:09,210
with an actual value back next slide so

885
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:11,849
this was the the format<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Justin</font>

886
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:14,130
proposed that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just put the payload as</font>

887
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:17,010
part of the events attribute as a sub

888
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:19,319
object so I've got it up there that

889
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:21,480
seems very<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasonable and from my</font>

890
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:27,740
perspective of<font color="#CCCCCC"> da thing</font>

891
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:29,970
so Tony raised the issue on distribution

892
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:31,589
before the meeting so it went<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the</font>

893
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:34,319
slide deck we've had other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

894
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:37,109
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee subscription model good but one</font>

895
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:39,330
of the ones Tony said is why arbitrarily

896
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:41,119
limit this to jots maybe we can use the

897
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:44,279
control plane<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage other</font>

898
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:48,060
relationships and other protocols and

899
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:50,940
other formats and they'll be some

900
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:52,380
reworking but I don't see why not though

901
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,600
I come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that the chartered</font>

902
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:58,950
objective is to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure we can deliver</font>

903
00:45:54,600 --> 00:46:03,779
a jot correctly but I don't see any

904
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:09,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason why we should shut</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it down so be</font>

905
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:13,770
interesting comments on that one yeah so

906
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:18,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">and also Kathleen's comments on taxing</font>

907
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:22,590
sticks are well well advised so that's

908
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:26,010
it so any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions or comments about</font>

909
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:27,930
this presentation since it's our generic

910
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:39,660
to the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who delay until a</font>

911
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:42,740
few for a few more minutes I understood

912
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,740
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe the wider audience</font>

913
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:51,689
conversation so sticks is<font color="#CCCCCC"> sticks is huge</font>

914
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:53,820
and it's about indicators of compromise

915
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:57,330
and events and security related

916
00:46:53,820 --> 00:47:00,720
incidents very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very large so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that might</font>

917
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:04,109
wind up using something like this taxi

918
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,850
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they call their transport and in</font>

919
00:47:04,109 --> 00:47:07,590
my opinion it's way too bloated for what

920
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:09,390
you're looking especially with the

921
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:10,950
description<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what you are looking for</font>

922
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:13,529
in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements and the reason I</font>

923
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:17,790
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is that taxi supports multiple</font>

924
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:20,490
protocols so you need a broker to broker

925
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:24,330
which protocol you're going to connect

926
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:28,680
with whether it's HTTP XMPP or some

927
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:31,200
other transport so and what I've heard

928
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:33,600
and I keep hearing is that it doesn't

929
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,368
work right no surprise that's a huge

930
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,140
interoperability

931
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:39,690
challenge to overcome when you have that

932
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:42,118
type of complexity built in so simpler

933
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:44,940
is always better if you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

934
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:47,730
this done in a simple way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and meet</font>

935
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:51,119
the needs so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are just some of my</font>

936
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:56,519
opinions not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an ad as a contributor</font>

937
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:58,769
on on sticks and taxi but yeah you

938
00:47:56,519 --> 00:48:03,450
wouldnt want to bake your stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> into six</font>

939
00:47:58,769 --> 00:48:06,390
because it's big enough and yeah yeah I

940
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:09,240
mean they can use each other but not be

941
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:11,609
the same I don't yes and I agree and I

942
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:14,008
totally worried about the same thing

943
00:48:11,609 --> 00:48:17,220
happening here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't want that to</font>

944
00:48:14,009 --> 00:48:18,630
happen so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think well I'm trying to</font>

945
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:23,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">remain neutral I might be applying</font>

946
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:26,490
pressure in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> regard so this is ben k</font>

947
00:48:23,549 --> 00:48:28,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">dukh and maybe i just missed this when</font>

948
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:30,269
you're talking about it but at least on

949
00:48:28,109 --> 00:48:32,549
the slides for the verification is that

950
00:48:30,269 --> 00:48:34,950
literally just ensuring that the

951
00:48:32,549 --> 00:48:38,788
connection works properly that's not

952
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:41,160
doing anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about confirming that you</font>

953
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:44,430
know if somebody's claiming that they

954
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:47,098
have a user with this email<font color="#CCCCCC"> address that</font>

955
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:49,799
you know they actually have that<font color="#CCCCCC"> email</font>

956
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:51,779
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> or anything like that yeah it's</font>

957
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:54,660
really verifying that the connection

958
00:48:51,779 --> 00:48:58,049
works and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the stated in and you</font>

959
00:48:54,660 --> 00:49:00,390
know if we're using jwe or jws that

960
00:48:58,049 --> 00:49:03,420
those were validating correctly sure

961
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:04,859
doesn't necessarily verify that the

962
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:07,109
publisher is knowledgeable or

963
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:13,259
intelligent or a threat<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us that's</font>

964
00:49:07,109 --> 00:49:16,710
sort of remaining work yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have one</font>

965
00:49:13,259 --> 00:49:18,119
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we was just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on Justin's</font>

966
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:21,710
proposal until it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

967
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:23,970
reasonable to me to embed the the

968
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:25,170
attributes inside the payload is that

969
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:28,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">something we're going to vote on or we</font>

970
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:28,940
just we just accepting that change

971
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:44,050
I don't mind voting on that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

972
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:45,850
had three alternatives for well<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

973
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:48,070
following the format in general the real

974
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:50,740
question is when there is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> payload</font>

975
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:53,260
what should go<font color="#E5E5E5"> after I would it be the</font>

976
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:57,129
event you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> I colon no should it be</font>

977
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:59,140
event you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> i colon true or an empty</font>

978
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:02,080
set of brackets and I prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

979
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:03,670
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one some people thought</font>

980
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:09,150
when they read it that's saying I'm not

981
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:12,490
asserting then because it's null true is

982
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:13,900
valid but a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are</font>

983
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:15,870
writing code might be lazy and they're

984
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:17,980
always expecting adjacent object so that

985
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:21,819
then we came back to why don't we just

986
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:23,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">assert an empty object and i'm saying i</font>

987
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:25,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">have no payload and it's less characters</font>

988
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:30,009
so that's i kind of thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm inclined</font>

989
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:31,540
to agree um what do you think I'm

990
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:34,600
inclined to agree easy something that

991
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:36,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're gonna like just I guess like solve</font>

992
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:44,620
this problem we gonna write on a door we

993
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:46,900
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that John John Bradley ping so</font>

994
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:49,900
while I'm personally in favor of the

995
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:52,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">empty object I think that we're probably</font>

996
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:55,300
knew enough and this hasn't actually

997
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:58,509
been discussed on the group mailing list

998
00:50:55,300 --> 00:51:00,160
that we may actually want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

999
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:02,260
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the docking people have the</font>

1000
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,910
document has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopted as a working</font>

1001
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:06,460
group document and people read it before

1002
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:07,930
we necessarily start making changes but

1003
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:10,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">I happen to be in favor of the empty</font>

1004
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:13,450
object hopefully in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other order my</font>

1005
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:15,430
life first reading 10 deduct my thought

1006
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:17,169
maybe you could advise me best thing as

1007
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:19,270
I was thinking as an individual

1008
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:22,060
contribute contribution right now I'm i

1009
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:24,280
think it's seems to me to be fairly

1010
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:26,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">obvious and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i would do one more vision</font>

1011
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:29,770
and then let then you can sort of

1012
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:32,740
nominate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> good option yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that work</font>

1013
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:34,750
yeah definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to</font>

1014
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:37,270
suggest exactly that make the change in

1015
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:39,340
yeah if we change it later we change it

1016
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:41,230
later but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was just run with it yeah I</font>

1017
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:43,720
was looking for informal feedback from

1018
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:45,160
people in the room here to say well

1019
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,839
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that that's really bad and I</font>

1020
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:50,819
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1021
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:54,270
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forward Bob</font>

1022
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:55,650
Moskowitz HT consulting is coming to the

1023
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:58,020
near the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your time slot so I</font>

1024
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:59,760
decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up now and provide</font>

1025
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:02,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mohammed I know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to say</font>

1026
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,710
in this room<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it there's time for it</font>

1027
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:09,899
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay as long as it's time for it i</font>

1028
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:12,000
will wait to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it okay oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay John</font>

1029
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:14,520
again just one clarification there were

1030
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,650
two sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're floating</font>

1031
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:22,560
around one was whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or not the</font>

1032
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:25,410
subject should be inside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

1033
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:27,840
object or and whether or not everything

1034
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:29,700
should are whether or not claims in

1035
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:32,630
general should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside the object I'm</font>

1036
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:35,310
assuming that we're only talking about

1037
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:37,500
creating the object but not necessarily

1038
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:40,380
enforcing that the subject must always

1039
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:42,390
be in there because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was the case</font>

1040
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:45,420
then other people would be up at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mic</font>

1041
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:48,330
or at your throat my read of the

1042
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:50,700
situation is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are some legacy</font>

1043
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:53,069
or backwards compatibility reasoning to

1044
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:55,109
keep the subject where it is at the top

1045
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:58,470
level so we're only agreeing to create

1046
00:52:55,110 --> 00:53:02,370
the object the rest of the text i'm not

1047
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:04,589
talking about unhinging yeah but anybody

1048
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:08,430
who has an issue should reopen it on the

1049
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:09,780
list<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm I'm still open on it William</font>

1050
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:16,700
says that he agrees with John's

1051
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:21,570
assessment okay okay thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

1052
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:23,160
so a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of notes from the chair the</font>

1053
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:27,420
next milestone for this group is to

1054
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:28,920
adopt drafts and all the dresses were

1055
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:32,670
presented here are still candidate

1056
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:34,050
drafts are not working draft and I'm not

1057
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:35,310
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a ham now because not</font>

1058
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:37,170
enough people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the room who are not</font>

1059
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:39,570
authorized ever have read the draft so

1060
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:41,220
we'll give you more time to read the

1061
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:43,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">drafts and then we'll make a cough</font>

1062
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:45,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">reduction on the mailing list but that</font>

1063
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:49,319
requires that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people actually read the</font>

1064
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:51,009
draft so please do so and we want to

1065
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:53,770
have drafts adopted

1066
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:55,510
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chicago but doing it earlier is</font>

1067
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:59,620
better than doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right before</font>

1068
00:53:55,510 --> 00:54:01,540
Chicago second thing the technical

1069
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:03,670
discussions should happen on the list

1070
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:05,770
I'm sure there's has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> there have</font>

1071
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:09,630
been a lot of technical discussions in

1072
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:11,530
the last 2-3 weeks since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've become</font>

1073
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:14,620
subscribe to the mailing list<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there</font>

1074
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:16,420
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been nothing so the discussions are</font>

1075
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:19,600
happening somewhere else please move

1076
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:23,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">them to the list third thing is that</font>

1077
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:25,779
some people approached me in doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1078
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,609
weekend said this shouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

1079
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:30,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this work should it be done it's</font>

1080
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:34,050
duplicating some other things and now is

1081
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:34,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you to come to the mic I</font>

1082
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,240
don't that all have a problem with this

1083
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:44,590
work being done i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's great work</font>

1084
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:46,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">for identity security events this is not</font>

1085
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:48,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">a etf security events this is wonderful</font>

1086
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:51,730
work on identity security events which

1087
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:54,819
needs to be done and so to call the ITF

1088
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:58,480
security events and for the outside

1089
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:59,650
world looking at it is is confusion

1090
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,630
relating with inside your organization

1091
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:04,000
you know indeed what you're talking

1092
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:05,950
about which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is great but for other</font>

1093
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,340
people looking at it's like what is

1094
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:11,350
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on here and so if there can be</font>

1095
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:15,190
maybe a little clarity it's a middle

1096
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:17,230
point on it that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the first</font>

1097
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:19,780
thing that that I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say as an</font>

1098
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:22,180
outsider though who subsidies done a lot

1099
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:25,090
of other identity work the other thing

1100
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:28,359
is is that it'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really nice to see</font>

1101
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:31,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">this in terms of data modeling of your</font>

1102
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:34,390
events so that there may be a broader

1103
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:38,080
context of adoption when people look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1104
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:41,080
these for say maybe small end devices

1105
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:42,880
with looking at how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with this I</font>

1106
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:46,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know yet I haven't looked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into it</font>

1107
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:48,700
but you you're aware there in the ilt

1108
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:51,670
space there there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some major major</font>

1109
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:53,379
issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of identity holes and</font>

1110
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:54,610
other things and there's anything which

1111
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:56,140
can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leverage in that</font>

1112
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:57,790
direction it could be of interest I

1113
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:59,259
don't know I haven't delved down that

1114
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:02,020
direction yet but it's one that

1115
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:04,210
intrigues me<font color="#E5E5E5"> personally and if I would</font>

1116
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,119
have liked data models for what you're

1117
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:07,789
doing here I

1118
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,499
see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can apply it in that world so</font>

1119
00:56:07,789 --> 00:56:12,529
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two requests I have one's a</font>

1120
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:14,689
meta point in terms of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your naming</font>

1121
00:56:12,529 --> 00:56:17,059
and the second one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in terms of data</font>

1122
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:21,460
modeling so that we can see if its

1123
00:56:17,059 --> 00:56:24,650
applicability in other areas thank you

1124
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:28,220
um I'm wondering if this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just a</font>

1125
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:30,650
naming problem yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for the name of</font>

1126
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:33,049
the group so cuz I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> breed into any</font>

1127
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:35,180
of that when I looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all this as an</font>

1128
00:56:33,049 --> 00:56:38,990
ad right when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg when we were</font>

1129
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:40,669
reviewing it because we focus on the

1130
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:44,990
Charter and the work and the names

1131
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:48,499
eventually go away anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iran's affirm</font>

1132
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:52,459
hearing a lot of potential privacy

1133
00:56:48,499 --> 00:56:57,049
issues as some more subtle like

1134
00:56:52,460 --> 00:57:00,440
transaction IDs revealing information

1135
00:56:57,049 --> 00:57:03,680
between applications some less subtle

1136
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:07,460
like the implicit whatever it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

1137
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:11,239
in the race presentation were the mere

1138
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:17,630
fact that i'm using gmail address as a

1139
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:20,869
recovery email a means that Jim and that

1140
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:24,559
Google gets to find out about basically

1141
00:57:20,869 --> 00:57:28,880
everything i'm using and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font>

1142
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:32,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">quite sure how to handle it one possible</font>

1143
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,730
one possibility would be to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with a</font>

1144
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:37,879
use case document which normally I don't

1145
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:40,970
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and but it will address the the</font>

1146
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:45,380
privacy issues somehow there may be

1147
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:47,450
other ways to deal with it thank you so

1148
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:50,299
I was gonna wait till the technical line

1149
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:52,489
was was done and but people are leaving

1150

1153
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:07,819
kind enough to be an acting chair and so

thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much but please send a</font>

1155
00:58:07,819 --> 00:58:13,670
message to Stephen and myself because we

1156
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:15,680
work on these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> together about you</font>

00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:17,950
know if you'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a chair of this</font>

1158
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,950
group

1159
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:25,740
benkei decks are just falling a little

1160
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:28,990
bit off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous comment that you</font>

1161
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:31,899
yes this is essentially worth doing uh

1162
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:34,959
but you know identity and identity

1163
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:37,330
events or not you there's not a monopoly

1164
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,910
for them in the web in the world there's

1165
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:42,098
certainly other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you might be</font>

1166
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:47,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this are perhaps not even</font>

1167
00:58:42,099 --> 00:58:48,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the room just in one of the things</font>

1168
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:49,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was in the room but was told we</font>

1169
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:52,330
didn't have time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the schedule</font>

1170
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:54,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">um one of the driving use cases that</font>

1171
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:56,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">started out this working group is</font>

1172
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:58,118
actually work that we've been doing in

1173
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:01,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">the open ID foundations heart working</font>

1174
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:04,060
group and that's all about notification

1175
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:06,879
and audit ability of consent

1176
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:08,470
transactions so when a user says yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1177
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">allowing this medical record to go to</font>

1178
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:13,029
this provider or something like that

1179
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:15,280
providing a way to ship that kind of

1180
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:17,260
information and one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

1181
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,900
happen when we first founded this

1182
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:21,970
working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that was due to a</font>

1183
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,650
realization that the stuff that we were

1184
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:25,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">working on and the stuff that risk was</font>

1185
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:28,089
working on there was this common thread

1186
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:29,950
that we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start pulling at so</font>

1187
00:59:28,089 --> 00:59:31,750
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than just identity</font>

1188
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:34,750
transaction events there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more</font>

1189
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:38,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">than just even kind of the OAuth II open</font>

1190
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:40,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">ID connect security events going on here</font>

1191
00:59:38,109 --> 00:59:43,180
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> could use this kind of same core</font>

1192
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:45,970
mechanism and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that we should</font>

1193
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:53,319
definitely pursue that in sort of the

1194
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:55,569
broader case I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that comment</font>

1195
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:58,180
and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to add on the topic of</font>

1196
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:59,859
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of why we're doing this you know</font>

1197
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:01,899
one of the one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1198
00:59:59,859 --> 01:00:04,089
you know job was obviously standardized

1199
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:05,770
in the ITF and this is a profile of

1200
01:00:04,089 --> 01:00:08,470
chart that describes how they can use

1201
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:11,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">the security events and you know doing</font>

1202
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:12,848
on that comment from justin is that we

1203
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:15,220
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's kind of</font>

1204
01:00:12,849 --> 01:00:16,780
one way to do this that all these

1205
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:18,879
different groups could<font color="#E5E5E5"> could use and</font>

1206
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:20,830
avoid having sort of competing ways and

1207
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:23,230
when we first looked at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem they</font>

1208
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:26,020
were sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some messy hacks using jot</font>

1209
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:29,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">to to a sort of avoid like accidental</font>

1210
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:30,640
miss processing 11 type of jhad as a

1211
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:31,660
different type of job and so we sort of

1212
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,910
felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1213
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:36,399
also be safer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more secure to have</font>

1214
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:39,788
kind of this one representation of an

1215
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:42,099
event to meet the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier so I'm</font>

1216
01:00:39,789 --> 01:00:52,329
personally in favor of doing this work

1217
01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:56,440
in the IDF if we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore look</font>

1218
01:00:52,329 --> 01:00:58,539
so just make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that blue sheets get</font>

1219
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:04,349
back to me and that you've signed them

1220
01:00:58,539 --> 01:01:04,349
and hope we'll see you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all in Chicago</font>

1221
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:20,870
you
